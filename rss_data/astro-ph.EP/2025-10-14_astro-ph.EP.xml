      <title>Spatial Profiles of 3I/ATLAS CN and Ni Outgassing from Keck/KCWI Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Spin and Obliquity Distributions of Low-mass Planets Shaped by Dynamical Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanetary systems hosting multiple low-mass planets are thought to have experienced dynamical instability, during which planet-planet collisions and mergers occur; these collisions can impart substantial amount of angular momentum to the merger remnants, changing the obliquities of the resulting planets significantly. In this work, we carry out a series of $N$-body experiments to investigate the spin magnitude $(|\vec{S}|)$ and obliquity $(\theta_{\rm SL})$ distributions of low-mass exoplanets that have gone through planetary collisions. In our fiducial super-Earth (with $m=3M_{\oplus}$, $R=1.3R_{\oplus}$) and mini-Neptune systems (with $m=9M_{\oplus}$, $R=2.5R_{\oplus}$), the collision products follow a nearly uniform distribution in $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}$ and the spin-magnitude distribution is approximately linear in $|\vec{S}|$. Parameter studies and theoretical analysis show that increasing planetary radii or masses, or decreasing the initial planet-planet mutual inclinations, tend to polarize the obliquity distribution toward alignment or anti-alignment (i.e., excess probability near $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}=\pm1$). Experiments with initially two-planet and three-planet systems produce qualitatively similar outcomes, suggesting that the trends in this study may generalize to systems with higher planetary multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: TOI-5916 b &amp; TOI-6158 b are two Saturn-density planets orbiting M2 dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm the planetary nature of (1) TOI-5916 b and (2) TOI-6158 b, two Exoplanets Transiting M-dwarf Stars (GEMS), both discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Both systems were confirmed with ground-based photometry (Red Buttes Observatory and Swope, respectively) and radial velocity data from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. Their radii are $R_{1}=11.8^{+0.52}_{-0.51}\text{ }R_{\oplus}$ and $R_{2}=10.4^{+2.70}_{-1.11}\text{ }R_{\oplus}$ and masses are $M_{1}=219\pm28\text{ }M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{2}=135^{+19}_{-18}\text{ }M_{\oplus}$. Both planets have Saturn-like densities ($\rho_{1} = 0.73^{+0.14}_{-0.13}\,\text{g cm}^{-3}$, $\rho_{2} = 0.66^{+0.41}_{-0.23}\,\text{g cm}^{-3}$), which appears to be a growing trend among GEMS systems and, more generally, warm Jupiters. In confirming both of these exoplanets, we add to the growing evidence for a population of Saturn-density planets among the GEMS systems. We also find evidence for a preliminary trend in which GEMS exhibit systematically closer orbits compared to FGK giants.</description>

      <title>Hubble reveals complex multi-scale structure in the edge-on protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution (&lt;0.1") Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of the near edge-on (i~80 deg) protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707 ("Dracula's Chivito") obtained across six broadband filters spanning 0.4-1.6 microns. These observations unveil the scattered light from this unusually large disk (~14", or ~4200 au at 300 pc) in remarkable detail, revealing a rich tapestry of substructure, including brightness asymmetries and signatures of dynamical activity. Extended filaments are detected extending ~10" from the northern edges of both nebulae, while no comparable southern features are observed. In addition to large-scale asymmetries, the disk exhibits prominent wispy features that extend well above the midplane and are visible in all filters, suggesting a complex, possibly turbulent outer disk atmosphere shaped by infall, dynamical stirring, or gravitational instability. The central dark lane narrows from optical to near-IR wavelengths, and high-resolution millimeter data reveal compact midplane emission. Although our radiative transfer simulations show that the current data cannot yet distinguish between dust-settling and no-settling scenarios, they underscore the need for deeper observations of this unique system. IRAS 23077+6707 thus represents a rare and valuable laboratory for studying the vertical structure, asymmetries, and evolutionary state of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>The resilience of the sailboat stable region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems host complex orbital dynamics where test particles can occupy stable regions despite strong gravitational perturbations. The sailboat region, discovered in the Pluto-Charon system, allows highly eccentric S-type orbits at intermediate distances between the two massive bodies. This region challenges traditional stability concepts by supporting eccentricities up to 0.9 in a zone typically dominated by chaotic motion. We investigate the sailboat region's existence and extent across different binary system configurations. We examine how variations in mass ratio, secondary body eccentricity, particle inclination, and argument of pericenter affect this stable region. We performed 1.2 million numerical simulations of the elliptic three-body problem to generate four datasets exploring different parameter spaces. We trained XGBoost machine learning models to classify stability across approximately $10^9$ initial conditions. We validated our results using Poincar\'e surface of section and Lyapunov exponent analysis to confirm the dynamical mechanisms underlying the stability. The sailboat region exists only for binary mass ratios $\mu = [0.05, 0.22]$. Secondary body eccentricity severely constrains the region, following an exponential decay: $e_{s,\mathrm{max}} \approx 0.016 + 0.614 \exp(-25.6\mu)$. The region tolerates particle inclinations up to $90^\circ$ and persists in retrograde configurations for $\mu \leq 0.16$. Stability requires specific argument of pericenter values within $\pm 10^\circ$ to $\pm 30^\circ$ of $\omega = 0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Our machine learning models achieved over 97\% accuracy in predicting stability. The sailboat region shows strong sensitivity to system parameters, particularly secondary body eccentricity. Among Solar System dwarf planet binaries, Pluto-Charon, Orcus-Vanth and Varda-Ilmar\"e systems could harbor such regions.</description>

      <title>A Systematic North-South asymmetry in the Steady-state Climate of rapidly-rotating Oblique Water Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary obliquity (axial tilt) plays an important role in regulating the climate evolution and habitability of water-covered planets. Despite the suspicion of large obliquities in several exoplanetary systems, this phenomenon remains hard to observe directly. We aimed to study the effect of mass, obliquity, and rotation on the steady state climate of water-covered planets. We simulated the climate evolution of such planets with varying obliquities, rotational speed, and mass using a general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, assuming aqua-planet configurations.
  High obliquity supports an asymmetry between the equilibrium climatological conditions in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar temperature ratio deviates further from unity with increasing obliquity and rotation rate. Cloud coverage patterns also shift with obliquity, displaying distinct latitudinal bands and increased cloudiness in the warmer hemisphere.
  The climate of habitable-zone aqua-planets turns out to be sensitive to changes in obliquity and rotation rate, but are independent of planet mass. Our results highlight the importance of considering these factors when assessing the surface conditions of exoplanets. As a consequence, surface condition asymmetries in water-world exo-planets can be used to infer the planet's obliquity and rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Near the Runaway: The Climate and Habitability of Teegarden's Star b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teegarden's Star b, a nearby terrestrial world receiving an Earth-like instellation, is a prime candidate for next-generation observatories targeting temperate exoplanets in their habitable zones. We employ a suite of three-dimensional global climate model (GCM) simulations to (1) map the inner boundary of the habitable zone of Teegarden's Star b and (2) characterize its surface climate under the assumption of an Earth-analog atmosphere. Our simulations show that, with its most recently estimated instellation of 1481 Wm^-2, Teegarden's Star b remains below the runaway greenhouse threshold for both low (as=0.07, ocean-dominated) and moderate (as=0.30, land-dominated) surface albedos. However, a different estimate of 1565 Wm^-2 places it beyond the runaway threshold. The result that Teegarden's Star b is habitable under the most recent instellation measurement reinforces its status as one of the most compelling targets for future habitability and biosignature searches. Given the planet's proximity to the runaway threshold, it would benefit from a comparative study done with other models using different parameterizations.</description>

      <title>The Two-Zone Temperature Distribution Model: Inferences on the Structure and Composition of Dusty Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand the mineralogy and structure of protoplanetary disks, it is important to analyze them from both an empirical spectrum-based perspective and a radiative transfer image-based perspective. In a prior paper, we set forth an empirical mineralogy mid-IR spectral model that conveyed spatial information and worked in tandem with a radiative transfer model, which formed the EaRTH Disk Model. In this article, we take the empirical portion of that model, the TZTD model, and refine it with a newly derived protoplanetary disk thermal emission formulation which uses a temperature distribution without requiring discrete integration; this simplified model uses an empirical relation between spatial distribution variables, which permits radiative transfer models to directly fit these spatial distribution variables more freely within the provided empirical constraints. We test this model against several $Spitzer~Space~Telescope$ Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra, primarily transition disks, and discuss the mineralogical and structural implications of the fits, including the implications for grain growth and processing within the atmospheric zones of the disks.</description>

      <title>Short-Lived Radioisotopic enrichment from AGB interlopers in low-mass star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.</description>

      <title>The rings of (2060) Chiron: Evidence of an evolving system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centaur (2060) Chiron has long been a candidate for hosting material in orbit, based on occultation and photometric and spectroscopic data. Here, we present a multichord stellar occultation observed on 2023 September 10 UT that reveals new and complex structures surrounding Chiron. High-cadence light curves show multiple secondary events that are best explained (when compared with a multishell interpretation) with a system of three confined rings located at average radii of 273, 325, and 438 km, the outermost of which lies beyond Chiron's Roche limit. The rings appear coplanar, with a mean pole orientation of {\lambda} = 151{\deg} +/- 4{\deg} and \b{eta} = 20{\deg} +/- 6{\deg}. A broader, disklike structure extends from about 200 to 800 km, and a newly detected faint feature is observed at ~1380 km. Chiron thus appears as the fourth small solar system body known for hosting a ring system. Comparisons with previous occultation events that have occurred since 1994 show that these features are not permanent. With these observations, we may witness for the first time the ongoing formation and evolution of a ring system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturn's moon Enceladus is an exciting destination for future exploration missions due to the scientifically interesting geyser region located on its South pole. In this work, we compile the different types of science orbit configurations that have been proposed in the literature and present numerical methods to compute each of them in the Saturn-Enceladus circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). In addition, we explore the utility of the higher period dynamical structures found in the CR3BP. Figures of merit such as the observational properties and geometries for each family of orbits are presented. By providing a consistent analysis of potential Enceladus science orbits, this work can serve as a baseline for future mission designs.</description>

      <title>Limits of Standard Tidal Models at Quaoar: Matching Weywot's Orbit, Missing the Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weywot, Quaoar's small satellite, follows a nearly circular orbit at a distance of 12.9 times Quaoar's diameter and coexists with a compact ring system. Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and Weywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution theory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day architecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions required. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two formalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT) framework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on Weywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital distances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal torques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin, however, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period based on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value. A match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates and if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are inconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense satellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most plausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated dwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated warm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis but cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an unrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that non-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss, or a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's rotational evolution.</description>

      <title>Using simultaneous mass accretion and external photoevaporation rates for d203-504 to constrain disc evolution processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cannot understand planet formation without understanding disc evolutionary processes. However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\alpha$ parameter is $3\times10^{-4}\leq\alpha_{\nu}\leq2\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\times10^{-3}\leq\alpha_{\rm DW}\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem). This indicates that it is either very young, i.e. &lt;0.1 Myr, or it has been shielded until recently, which would have protected the planet forming reservoir and helped facilitate planet growth despite it now residing in a harsh UV environment.</description>

      <title>The diverse shapes of binary asteroid satellites born from sub-escape-velocity moonlet mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent direct observations of atypically shaped rubble-pile satellites of sub-km asteroids in form of the spherically oblate Dimorphos and bilobate Selam challenge classical binary asteroid formation theories, which only explain the predominantly elongated population. This study further explores a rubble-pile satellite formation scenario for binary asteroid systems involving debris disks by investigating how mergers between moonlets with impact velocities below the mutual escape speed (sub-escape-velocity mergers) and tidal disruptions can create atypically shaped moons. We simulated sub-escape-velocity mergers between moonlets and studied the resulting structural evolution of the formed moon in a tidal environment using the polyhedral discrete elements method N-body code GRAINS. Firstly, we find that the shapes of rubble-pile moons formed by mergers in this regime are highly dependent on the shape and initial orientation of the involved moonlets. This can be explained by the moonlets largely retaining their individual structures during the impact. Secondly, we observe that mass-loss via tidal disruption for a bilobate object occurs in discrete regimes of distance to the primary. Closer to the primary, the innermost lobe is completely stripped off, while only a small piece of it is lost further out. Due to moonlets largely retaining their shape after undergoing a sub-escape-velocity merger, it is necessary to account for their non-sphericity to accurately model satellite formation in circumasteroidal debris disks. Moreover, the reshaping of merged objects via tidal disruption and distortion can produce oblate spheroid moons such as Dimorphos and highly elongated bilobate satellites with distinct necks such as Selam.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Short Period Super-Earth and Sub-Neptune Spanning the Radius Valley Orbiting the Kinematic Thick Disk Star TOI-2345</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial chemical link between stars and their orbiting exoplanets is thought to exist. If universal, this connection could affect the formation and evolution of all planets. Therefore, this potential vital link needs testing by characterising exoplanets around chemically-diverse stars. We present the discovery of two planets orbiting the metal-poor, kinematic thick-disk K-dwarf TOI-2345. TOI-2345 b is a super-Earth with a period of 1.05 days and TOI-2345 c is a sub-Neptune with a period of 21 days. In addition to the target being observed in 4 TESS sectors, we obtained 5 CHEOPS visits and 26 radial velocities from HARPS. By conducting a joint analysis of all the data, we find TOI-2345 b to have a radius of $1.504\substack{+0.047\\-0.044}$ R$_\oplus$ and a mass of $3.49\pm0.85$ M$_\oplus$; and TOI-2345 c to have a radius of $2.451\substack{+0.045\\-0.046}$ R$_\oplus$ and a mass of $7.27\substack{+2.27\\-2.45}$ M$_\oplus$. To explore chemical links between these planets and their host star, we model their interior structures newly accounting for devolatised stellar abundances. TOI-2345 adds to the limited sample of well characterised planetary systems around thick disk stars. This system challenges theories of formation and populations of planets around thick disk stars with its Ultra-Short Period super-Earth and the wide period distribution of these two planets spanning the radius valley.</description>

      <title>Born Dry or Born Wet? A Palette of Water Growth Histories in TRAPPIST-1 Analogs and Compact Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is still unclear whether exoplanets in compact multiplanet systems such as TRAPPIST-1 are able to accrete large quantities of volatiles, grow to sufficient mass, and maintain robust atmospheres and hydrospheres. Previous estimates of water content in M-dwarf systems have largely relied on population synthesis or atmosphere-interior evolution models, often treating impacts and atmospheric loss in isolation. In this work, we couple impact delivery, impact erosion, and mantle-atmosphere exchange within a model that tracks volatile evolution through stochastic collision histories. By explicitly including both planetesimal accretion and the prolonged luminous pre-main-sequence phase of M dwarfs, we find lower water inventories for the inner TRAPPIST-1 analogs (b-e), spanning only $10^{-4}$-$10^{-2} M_{\oplus,\rm ocn}$ across a wide range of disk structures and impact scenarios. By contrast, the outer planets (f-h analogs) frequently retain water inventories exceeding an Earth ocean mass. This systematic volatile gradient provides a physically motivated explanation for JWST's nondetections of atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 b and c, implying an origin rooted in formation conditions rather than in post-formation escape. Our results suggest that many rocky planets in compact M-dwarf systems may form already depleted in volatile compounds, fundamentally limiting their capacity to sustain atmospheres or surface oceans. More broadly, our multistage framework for volatile tracking can help interpret future observations of compact systems and set more realistic initial conditions for exoplanet interior compositions and atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Model of deep zonal flows in giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism by which the surface zonal flows of giant planets can be gradually attenuated with depth is explored. The zonal flow is driven by an imposed forcing in a thin layer near the surface. A meridional circulation is set up, analogous to the Ferrel-like cells observed in Jupiter's atmosphere. Acting on a stably stratified thin surface layer, the meridional flow induces a horizontal temperature anomaly which leads to a gradual reduction of the zonal winds with depth, governed by the thermal wind equation. Our model is a Boussinesq plane layer, with gravity acting parallel to the rotation axis. A suite of fully three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations has been performed to investigate the model behaviour. Below the forced stable layer, convection is occurring, typically in the form of tall thin cells. The fluctuating components of the three-dimensional flow can be driven by either the convection or the Reynolds stresses associated with the jet shear flow. When fluctuations are mainly driven by convection in the form of tall thin columns and the forcing is relatively weak, the horizontal temperature anomaly persists much deeper into the interior than when it is driven by shear flow. The zonal jets can therefore extend deep into the interior, consistent with the Juno gravity data.</description>

      <title>Experimental tests of the calibration of high precision differential astrometry for HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many different scientific applications require sub-micro arcsecond precision astrometry, including researching rocky exoplanets in the vicinity of the Sun and studying dark matter. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is a promising candidate to carry an astrometric instrument because it provides a stable, space-based telescope with a large aperture, which allows faint sources and small displacements to be observed. This paper presents the characterization of an appropriate detector for an astrometric instrument: the 46Mpx Gigapyx from Pyxalis. Moreover it explains the implementation of a testbed enabling interferometric characterization of pixel positions. Finally, the paper introduces a method for calibrating the telescope's optical distortion. This method was implemented in simulation and tested thanks to an optical bench developed at IPAG in France.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Formation of the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold Classical Kuiper belt objects (CCKBOs) are considered first-generation planetesimals that formed 42-47 au from the Sun and remained untouched since. Formation is thought to proceed by clumping of dust particles in protoplanetary disk gas by the streaming instability, followed by gravitational collapse. Previous calculations along these lines are inconsistent with the CCKB's supposedly pristine nature, because they assume orders of magnitude more solid mass than is actually present in the CCKB (a few thousandths of an Earth mass) and do not explain how to expel the &gt;99% extra mass. Here we show from 3D numerical simulations of dust and gas that the total mass in CCKBOs, their characteristic sizes of ~100 km, and the relative proportion of prograde to retrograde binaries can all be reproduced at the tail end of the solar nebula's life, when it contained just 2-5% of its original (minimum-mass) gas. As a solar metallicity's worth of mm-sized solids drains out from 42-47 au from nebular headwinds, about 1% of the dust collapses into planetesimals that remain behind in the CCKB region. Binarity is guaranteed from a simple analytic estimate, confirmed numerically, of the spin angular momentum in clumps seeded by the streaming instability. We show that other formation scenarios, including trapping of dust within a gas pressure bump, fail to reproduce the low-mass CCKB. Outstanding problems are identified.</description>

      <title>Investigating aerosols as a way to reconcile K2-18 b JWST MIRI and NIRISS/NIRSpec observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b with NIRISS SOSS/NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS have yielded apparently inconsistent results: the MIRI spectra exhibit spectral features nearly twice as large as those seen at shorter wavelengths, challenging the high-metallicity, CH4-rich non-equilibrium model that fits the NIRISS/NIRSpec data. We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties. Our results underscore the importance of aerosol absorption in interpreting temperate sub-Neptune spectra, and motivate future JWST observations and laboratory work to break these degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>
