      <title>Autonomous Trajectory Optimization for UAVs in Disaster Zone Using Henry Gas Optimization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a disaster-prone environment plays important role in assisting the rescue services and providing the internet connectivity with the outside world. However, in such a complex environment the selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time. In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8% reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in smart cities.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Operation and Maintenance and Prediction Model Optimization for Improving Wind Power Generation Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of predictive maintenance models and the optimization of intelligent Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) systems in improving wind power generation efficiency. Through qualitative research, structured interviews were conducted with five wind farm engineers and maintenance managers, each with extensive experience in turbine operations. Using thematic analysis, the study revealed that while predictive maintenance models effectively reduce downtime by identifying major faults, they often struggle with detecting smaller, gradual failures. Key challenges identified include false positives, sensor malfunctions, and difficulties in integrating new models with older turbine systems. Advanced technologies such as digital twins, SCADA systems, and condition monitoring have significantly enhanced turbine maintenance practices. However, these technologies still require improvements, particularly in AI refinement and real-time data integration. The findings emphasize the need for continuous development to fully optimize wind turbine performance and support the broader adoption of renewable energy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Lifelong Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in dynamic and unpredictable environments requires adaptive communication and energy harvesting strategies. We propose a novel adaptive control strategy for WSNs that optimizes data transmission and EH to minimize overall energy consumption while ensuring queue stability and energy storing constraints under dynamic environmental conditions. The notion of adaptability therein is achieved by transferring the known environment-specific knowledge to new conditions resorting to the lifelong reinforcement learning concepts. We evaluate our proposed method against two baseline frameworks: Lyapunov-based optimization, and policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL). Simulation results demonstrate that our approach rapidly adapts to changing environmental conditions by leveraging transferable knowledge, achieving near-optimal performance approximately $30\%$ faster than the RL method and $60\%$ faster than the Lyapunov-based approach.</description>

      <title>Detailed Small-Signal Stability Analysis of the Cigr\'e High-Voltage Network Penetrated by Grid-Following Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed small-signal stability analysis of a modified version of the Cigr\'e European high-voltage network, where one of the synchronous generators is replaced by a grid-following inverter-based resource (IBR). The analysis focuses on the influence of the parameters defining the grid-following IBR control scheme on the stability of the system. Given a set of potential grid configurations and the value of the IBR control parameters, stability is verified by the direct eigenvalue analysis of a high-detailed linearized model of the overall Cigr\'e network. Starting from this procedure, we propose an adaptive sampling method for training a support vector machine classifier able to estimate the probability of stability of the power system over a domain defined by candidate intervals of the considered parameters. The training of the classifier is refined to identify with more accuracy the boundaries of the parameters' stability regions. The obtained results are then compared with those obtained by representing the grid with the classical Th\'evenin equivalent. Results suggest that, when the Th\'evenin equivalent is accurate, the predicted stability region is conservative yet contained within that of the full network.</description>

      <title>Emission-Aware Operation of Electrical Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, there has been a growing body of research and developments supporting the participation of energy storage systems (ESS) in the emission reduction mandates. However, regardless of these efforts and despite the need for an accelerated energy transition, we have yet to see a practical framework for operational carbon accounting and credit trading for energy storage systems. In this context, this paper proposes an emission performance credits (EPCs) framework that allows ESS, down to the prosumer level, to participate in the carbon market. Thus, a mechanism is proposed, for the first time, to calculate the grid's real-time marginal emission intensity (MEI). The MEI is then used to optimize the cumulative operational emission of ESS through carbon-aware dispatch. Consequently, the framework tracks the operational emissions and converts them into EPCs, which are then sold to regulated entities under compliance programs. Simulation results support the potential of ESS, regardless of their size, to participate in the broader carbon mitigation objectives.</description>

      <title>Power Handling Improvement in Cross-Sectional Lame Mode Resonators Operating in the Ku-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents power handling improvements in cross-sectional Lame-Mode Resonators (CLMRs) designed for operation in the Ku-band. Previously fabricated CLMR devices failed at approximately 8 dBm of input power, primarily due to electromigration in the aluminum interdigitated electrodes (IDTs). To better understand this mechanism in CLMRs, a data driven thermal model is developed to analyze localized heating effects within the resonator body, which are known to accelerate electromigration. Based on insights from this model, Aluminum Silicon Copper (AlSiCu) was selected for the IDTs due to its superior thermal stability and resistance to electromigration. Devices fabricated with AlSiCu exhibited no signs of performance degradation, with the best-performing resonator achieving a mechanical quality factor (Qm) of 360, a maximum Bode quality factor (QBode) of 500, and an electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt2) of 6.3%. Moreover, the use of AlSiCu significantly increased the maximum input power the device can withstand, showing an improvement of up to 6 dBm over previous devices. These improvements in power handling make the devices strong candidates for high-power Ku-band filtering applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Affine Formation Control of Linear Multi-agent Systems with Adaptive Event-triggering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerning general multi-agent systems with limited communication, this paper proposes distributed formation control protocols under adaptive event-triggered schemes to operate affine transformations of nominal formations. To accommodate more practical system mechanics, we develop an event-triggered controller that drives the leader to a desired state by bringing in the compensation term. Based on triggering instants' state information, an affine formation control method with adaptive event-triggering is designed for each follower, making the whole protocol effective in refraining from successive communication while not relying on predefined global information. In particular, mitigating the effect of partial state availability, an output-based control solution is presented to expand the protocol's serviceable range. Finally, we perform numerical simulations on the formation and its affine transformations to verify the effectiveness of the control protocol and the feasibility of the event-triggered mechanism.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Multirotor Control for Spherical Target Tracking: A Bearing-Angle Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of designing a visual servo controller for a multirotor vehicle, with the end goal of tracking a moving spherical target with unknown radius. To address this problem, we first transform two bearing measurements provided by a camera sensor into a bearing-angle pair. We then use this information to derive the system's dynamics in a new set of coordinates, where the angle measurement is used to quantify a relative distance to the target. Building on this system representation, we design an adaptive nonlinear control algorithm that takes advantage of the properties of the new system geometry and assumes that the target follows a constant acceleration model. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Formal Control for Uncertain Systems via Contract-Based Probabilistic Surrogates (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The requirement for identifying accurate system representations has not only been a challenge to fulfill, but it has compromised the scalability of formal methods, as the resulting models are often too complex for effective decision making with formal correctness and performance guarantees. Focusing on probabilistic simulation relations and surrogate models of stochastic systems, we propose an approach that significantly enhances the scalability and practical applicability of such simulation relations by eliminating the need to compute error bounds directly. As a result, we provide an abstraction-based technique that scales effectively to higher dimensions while addressing complex nonlinear agent-environment interactions with infinite-horizon temporal logic guarantees amidst uncertainty. Our approach trades scalability for conservatism favorably, as demonstrated on a complex high-dimensional vehicle intersection case study.</description>

      <title>Trajectory tracking control of USV with actuator constraints in the presence of disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All practical systems often pose a problem of finite control capability, which can notably degrade the performance if not properly addressed. Since actuator input bounds are typically known, integrating actuator saturation considerations into the control law design process can lead to enhanced performance and more precise trajectory tracking. Also, the actuators cannot provide the demanded forces or torques instantaneously; hence, there is a limitation on the rate of magnitude. This work proposes nonlinear feedback controller designs developed using the Lyapunov stability and backstepping method while actively considering the actuator magnitude and rate constraints. The system dynamics are augmented with a smooth control input saturation model. Additionally, an observer is incorporated to estimate the disturbance vector. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we demonstrate the system's stability under the proposed controller for the Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV), ensuring adherence to actuator constraints provided their initial values fall within the prescribed bounds. Extensive numerical simulations performed by considering various trajectories and multiple initial conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in maintaining tracking performance without violating actuator constraints. This work also relaxes the assumption of equally capable actuators to be used to control the motion of USVs, affirming the viability of the controller in practical applications.</description>

      <title>On the input admittance of a universal power synchronization controller with droop controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has proposed a universal framework that integrates the well-established power synchronization control into vector current control. Using this controller for the parallel operation of grid-forming converters, and/or with loads that have strong voltage magnitude sensitivity, requires additional loops manipulating the voltage magnitude, e.g., $QV$ and $PV$ voltage-power droop controllers. This paper derives the input admittance of the resulting overall scheme. Sensitivity analyses based on the passivity index demonstrate the benefits of the proportional components of $QV$ and $PV$ control. A case study is presented where a grid-forming converter is operated in parallel with a generator.</description>

      <title>Opportunities for real-time process control of electrode properties in lithium-ion battery manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have an important role in the shift required to achieve a global net-zero carbon target of 2050. Electrode manufacture is amongst the most expensive steps of the LIB manufacturing process and, despite its apparent maturity, optimised manufacturing conditions are arrived at by largely trial and error. Currently, LIB manufacturing plants are controlled to follow the fixed "recipe" obtained by trial and error, which may nonetheless be suboptimal. Moreover, regulating the process as a whole to conform to the set conditions is not widespread. Inspired by control approaches used in other film and sheet processes, we discuss opportunities for implementing real-time process control of electrode-related products, which has the potential to reduce the electrode manufacturing cost, CO2 emissions, usage of resources by increases in process yield, and throughput. We highlight the challenges and significant opportunities of implementing real-time process control in LIB electrode production lines.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Model Accuracy for Optimizing Battery Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates two models of varying complexity for optimizing intraday arbitrage energy trading of a battery energy storage system using a model predictive control approach. Scenarios reflecting different stages of the system's lifetime are analyzed. The findings demonstrate that the equivalent-circuit-model-based non-linear optimization model outperforms the simpler linear model by delivering more accurate predictions of energy losses and system capabilities. This enhanced accuracy enables improved operational strategies, resulting in increased roundtrip efficiency and revenue, particularly in systems with batteries exhibiting high internal resistance, such as second-life batteries. However, to fully leverage the model's benefits, it is essential to identify the correct parameters.</description>

      <title>Robust black start of an offshore wind farm with DRU based HVDC link using power synchronization control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a universal power synchronization controller for grid-side control of the wind turbine conversion systems in an offshore wind farm with a diode rectifier in the offshore substation of the HVDC link. The controller incorporates voltage-power droop controllers in the outer loop to enable the operation of this setup. To effectively handle the impact of large delays during black start and power ramp phases, virtual active and reactive power quantities are defined. These quantities are computed based on the current references prior to any modifications that might be needed to meet converter current and voltage limits or source constraints. Utilizing them in the outer loop ensures a balanced power sharing and a stable operation whenever the original (unmodified) current references are not realized. Case studies confirm the robustness of the proposed controller.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Molecular Communication with Local and Global Degradation: Modeling and ISI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel physics-based model for signal propagation in closed-loop molecular communication (MC) systems, which are particularly relevant for many envisioned biomedical applications, such as health monitoring or drug delivery within the closed-loop human cardiovascular system (CVS). Compared to open-loop systems, which are mostly considered in MC, closed-loop systems exhibit different characteristic effects influencing signaling molecule (SM) propagation. One key phenomenon are the periodic SM arrivals at the receiver (RX), leading to various types of inter-symbol interference (ISI) inherent to closed-loop system. To capture these characteristic effects, we propose an analytical model for the SM propagation inside closed-loop systems. The model accounts for arbitrary spatio-temporal SM release patterns at the transmitter (TX), and incorporates several environmental effects such as fluid flow, SM diffusion, and SM degradation. Moreover, to capture a wide range of practically relevant degradation and clearance mechanisms, the model includes both local removal (e.g., due to SM absorption into organs) and global removal (e.g., due to chemical degradation) of SMs. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated with three-dimensional (3-D) particle-based simulations (PBSs). Moreover, we utilize the proposed model to develop a rigorous characterization of the various types of ISI encountered in closed-loop MC systems.</description>

      <title>A tutorial overview of model predictive control for continuous crystallization: current possibilities and future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to the advanced control of continuous crystallization processes using model predictive control. We provide a tutorial introduction to controlling complex particle size distributions by integrating population balance equations with detailed models of various continuous crystallizers. Since these high-fidelity models are often too complex for online optimization, we propose the use of data-driven surrogate models that enable efficient optimization-based control. Through two case studies, one with a low-complexity system allowing direct comparison with traditional methods and another involving a spatially distributed crystallizer, we demonstrate how our approach enables real-time model predictive control while maintaining accuracy. The presented methodology facilitates the use of complex models in a model-based control framework, allowing precise control of key particle size distribution characteristics, such as the median particle size $d_{50}$ and the width $d_{90} - d_{10}$. This addresses a critical challenge in pharmaceutical and fine chemical manufacturing, where product quality depends on tight control of particle characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Set-valued Impact Law Approach for Modeling and Analysis of Rigid Contact Universal Joint with Clearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a dynamic model of a universal joint (U-Joint) with radial clearance, focusing on the rigid unilateral frictional contacts at the crosspiece and yoke interfaces. Unlike previous models that neglect crosspiece inertia and interface friction, this work incorporates these effects using a set-valued impact law based on Signorini's condition with Coulomb friction, capturing the complex non-smooth dynamics introduced by radial clearance. Numerical simulations of a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) shaft system reveal the critical influence of clearance on U-Joint dynamic behavior, including impact-induced oscillations, quasi-periodic motion, and chaotic dynamics, which are essential for accurate driveline modeling and real-time control in automotive, aerospace, and precision medical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher-Preconditioned Reinforcement Learning: From Single-Qubit Control to Rayleigh-Fading Link Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose Quantum-Preconditioned Policy Gradient (QPPG), a natural gradient-based algorithm for link adaptation that whitens policy updates using the full inverse quantum Fisher information with Tikhonov regularization. QPPG bridges classical and quantum geometry, achieving stable learning even under noise. Evaluated on classical and quantum environments, including noisy single-qubit Gym tasks and Rayleigh-fading channels, QPPG converges 4 times faster than REINFORCE and sustains a 1 dB gain under uncertainty. It reaches a 90 percent return in one hundred episodes with high noise robustness, showcasing the advantages of full QFI-based preconditioning for scalable quantum reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Robust control for multi-legged elongate robots in noisy environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern two and four legged robots exhibit impressive mobility on complex terrain, largely attributed to advancement in learning algorithms. However, these systems often rely on high-bandwidth sensing and onboard computation to perceive/respond to terrain uncertainties. Further, current locomotion strategies typically require extensive robot-specific training, limiting their generalizability across platforms. Building on our prior research connecting robot-environment interaction and communication theory, we develop a new paradigm to construct robust and simply controlled multi-legged elongate robots (MERs) capable of operating effectively in cluttered, unstructured environments. In this framework, each leg-ground contact is thought of as a basic active contact (bac), akin to bits in signal transmission. Reliable locomotion can be achieved in open-loop on "noisy" landscapes via sufficient redundancy in bacs. In such situations, robustness is achieved through passive mechanical responses. We term such processes as those displaying mechanical intelligence (MI) and analogize these processes to forward error correction (FEC) in signal transmission. To augment MI, we develop feedback control schemes, which we refer to as computational intelligence (CI) and such processes analogize automatic repeat request (ARQ) in signal transmission. Integration of these analogies between locomotion and communication theory allow analysis, design, and prediction of embodied intelligence control schemes (integrating MI and CI) in MERs, showing effective and reliable performance (approximately half body lengths per cycle) on complex landscapes with terrain "noise" over twice the robot's height. Our work provides a foundation for systematic development of MER control, paving the way for terrain-agnostic, agile, and resilient robotic systems capable of operating in extreme environments.</description>

Abstract: Small-scale autonomous vehicle platforms provide a cost-effective environment for developing and testing advanced driving systems. However, specific configurations within this scale are underrepresented, limiting full awareness of their potential. This paper focuses on a one-sixth-scale setup, offering a high-level overview of its design, hardware and software integration, and typical challenges encountered during development. We discuss methods for addressing mechanical and electronic issues common to this scale and propose guidelines for improving reliability and performance. By sharing these insights, we aim to expand the utility of small-scale vehicles for testing autonomous driving algorithms and to encourage further research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Pieceformer: Similarity-Driven Knowledge Transfer via Scalable Graph Transformer in VLSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design, enabling the reuse of prior solutions to reduce engineering effort and turnaround time. We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to 89% runtime reduction. These results validate the framework's effectiveness for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance. Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.</description>

      <title>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of a goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in oligopoly market.</description>

      <title>State-Space Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Interpretable Nonlinear System Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability of the underlying system dynamics. This paper proposes State-Space Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SS-KAN) to address this challenge by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein benchmarks. Results show that SS-KAN provides enhanced interpretability due to sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned univariate functions, which reveal system nonlinearities at the cost of accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art black-box models, highlighting SS-KAN as a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability of nonlinear system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust cascaded control architecture for over-actuated multirotors. It extends the Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) control combined with structured H_inf control, initially proposed for under-actuated multirotors, to a broader range of multirotor configurations. To achieve precise and robust attitude and position tracking, we employ a weighted least-squares geometric guidance control allocation method, formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, enabling full-pose tracking. The proposed approach effectively addresses key challenges, such as preventing infeasible pose references and enhancing robustness against disturbances, as well as considering multirotor's actual physical limitations. Numerical simulations with an over-actuated hexacopter validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse mission scenarios and its potential for real-world aerial applications.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Control of Electrical Stimulation through Spared Motor Unit Ensembles Restores Foot Movements after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restoring movement of a paralyzed foot is a key challenge in helping individuals with neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury (SCI) to improve their quality of life. Neuroprostheses based on functional electrical stimulation (FES) can restore the physiological range of motion by stimulating the affected muscles using surface electrodes. We have previously shown that, despite chronic motor-complete SCI, it is possible to capture paralyzed hand movements in individuals with tetraplegia using spared and modulated motor unit (MU) activity decoded with non-invasive electromyography (EMG) sensors. This study investigated whether a wearable high-density surface EMG system could capture and control paralyzed foot kinematics in closed-loop control with an FES system. We found that all our participants with SCI (2 with chronic SCI and 3 with acute SCI) retained distinct spared EMG activity for at least three ankle movements, which allowed them to reliably control a digital cursor using their spared tibialis anterior and triceps surae MU activity. Movement separability was further reconfirmed by extracting task-modulated MU activity during foot flexion/extension (3-7 modulated MUs/participant). Three participants were further able to modulate and maintain their foot flexion/extension EMG levels with an accuracy of &gt;70%. Lastly, we show that real-time control of a FES system using EMG from the affected limb can restore foot movements in a highly intuitive way, significantly improving the lost or pathological foot range of motion. Our system provides an intuitive approach for closed-loop control of FES that has the potential to assist individuals with SCI in regaining lost motor functions.</description>

      <title>eCAV: An Edge-Assisted Evaluation Platform for Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous vehicles edge closer to widespread adoption, enhancing road safety through collision avoidance and minimization of collateral damage becomes imperative. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, which include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-cloud (V2C), are being proposed as mechanisms to achieve this safety improvement.
  Simulation-based testing is crucial for early-stage evaluation of Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) control systems, offering a safer and more cost-effective alternative to real-world tests. However, simulating large 3D environments with many complex single- and multi-vehicle sensors and controllers is computationally intensive. There is currently no evaluation framework that can effectively evaluate realistic scenarios involving large numbers of autonomous vehicles.
  We propose eCAV -- an efficient, modular, and scalable evaluation platform to facilitate both functional validation of algorithmic approaches to increasing road safety, as well as performance prediction of algorithms of various V2X technologies, including a futuristic Vehicle-to-Edge control plane and correspondingly designed control algorithms. eCAV can model up to 256 vehicles running individual control algorithms without perception enabled, which is $8\times$ more vehicles than what is possible with state-of-the-art alternatives. %faster than state-of-the-art alternatives that can simulate $8\times$ fewer vehicles. With perception enabled, eCAV simulates up to 64 vehicles with a step time under 800ms, which is $4\times$ more and $1.5\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art OpenCDA framework.</description>

      <title>Agile, Autonomous Spacecraft Constellations with Disruption Tolerant Networking to Monitor Precipitation and Urban Floods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully re-orientable small spacecraft are now supported by commercial technologies, allowing them to point their instruments in any direction and capture images, with short notice. When combined with improved onboard processing, and implemented on a constellation of inter-communicable satellites, this intelligent agility can significantly increase responsiveness to transient or evolving phenomena. We demonstrate a ground-based and onboard algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control, inter-satellite communication, intelligent prediction and planning to schedule the time-varying, re-orientation of agile, small satellites in a constellation. Planner intelligence is improved by updating the predictive value of future space-time observations based on shared observations of evolving episodic precipitation and urban flood forecasts. Reliable inter-satellite communication within a fast, dynamic constellation topology is modeled in the physical, access control and network layer. We apply the framework on a representative 24-satellite constellation observing 5 global regions. Results show appropriately low latency in information exchange (average within 1/3rd available time for implicit consensus), enabling the onboard scheduler to observe ~7% more flood magnitude than a ground-based implementation. Both onboard and offline versions performed ~98% better than constellations without agility.</description>

      <title>BIDA: A Bi-level Interaction Decision-making Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicles in Dynamic Traffic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs, but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety, efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>An Optimization-Augmented Control Framework for Single and Coordinated Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation demands precise control over both contact forces and motion trajectories. While force control is essential for achieving compliant interaction and high-frequency adaptation, it is limited to operations in close proximity to the manipulated object and often fails to maintain stable orientation during extended motion sequences. Conversely, optimization-based motion planning excels in generating collision-free trajectories over the robot's configuration space but struggles with dynamic interactions where contact forces play a crucial role. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-modal control framework that combines force control and optimization-augmented motion planning to tackle complex robotic manipulation tasks in a sequential manner, enabling seamless switching between control modes based on task requirements. Our approach decomposes complex tasks into subtasks, each dynamically assigned to one of three control modes: Pure optimization for global motion planning, pure force control for precise interaction, or hybrid control for tasks requiring simultaneous trajectory tracking and force regulation. This framework is particularly advantageous for bimanual and multi-arm manipulation, where synchronous motion and coordination among arms are essential while considering both the manipulated object and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the versatility of our method through a range of long-horizon manipulation tasks, including single-arm, bimanual, and multi-arm applications, highlighting its ability to handle both free-space motion and contact-rich manipulation with robustness and precision.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Optimization for Monotone Systems without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) steers a dynamical plant to a cost-efficient steady-state, only relying on input-output sensitivity information, rather than on a full plant model. Unlike traditional feedforward approaches, OFO leverages real-time measurements from the plant, thereby inheriting the robustness and adaptability of feedback control. Unfortunately, existing theoretical guarantees for OFO assumes that the controller operates on a slower timescale than the plant, which can affect responsiveness and transient performance. In this paper, we focus on relaxing this ``timescale separation'' assumption. Specifically, we consider the class of monotone systems, and we prove that OFO can achieve an optimal operating point, regardless of the time constants of controller and plant. By leveraging a small gain theorem for monotone systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for global convergence. Notably, these conditions depend only on the steady-state behavior of the plant, and they are entirely independent of the transient dynamics.</description>

      <title>DRIVE Through the Unpredictability:From a Protocol Investigating Slip to a Metric Estimating Command Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-road autonomous navigation is a challenging task as it is mainly dependent on the accuracy of the motion model. Motion model performances are limited by their ability to predict the interaction between the terrain and the UGV, which an onboard sensor can not directly measure. In this work, we propose using the DRIVE protocol to standardize the collection of data for system identification and characterization of the slip state space. We validated this protocol by acquiring a dataset with two platforms (from 75 kg to 470 kg) on six terrains (i.e., asphalt, grass, gravel, ice, mud, sand) for a total of 4.9 hours and 14.7 km. Using this data, we evaluate the DRIVE protocol's ability to explore the velocity command space and identify the reachable velocities for terrain-robot interactions. We investigated the transfer function between the command velocity space and the resulting steady-state slip for an SSMR. An unpredictability metric is proposed to estimate command uncertainty and help assess risk likelihood and severity in deployment. Finally, we share our lessons learned on running system identification on large UGV to help the community.</description>

Abstract: This work presents an indigenous web based platform Orbital Collision (OrCo), created by the Space Systems Laboratory at IIIT Delhi, to enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by predicting collision probabilities of space objects using Two Line Elements (TLE) data. The work highlights the growing challenges of congestion in the Earth's orbital environment, mainly due to space debris and defunct satellites, which increase collision risks. It employs several methods for propagating orbital uncertainty and calculating the collision probability. The performance of the platform is evaluated through accuracy assessments and efficiency metrics, in order to improve the tracking of space objects and ensure the safety of the satellite in congested space.</description>

      <title>A Vision for Trustworthy, Fair, and Efficient Socio-Technical Control using Karma Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control systems will play a pivotal role in addressing societal-scale challenges as they drive the development of sustainable future smart cities. At the heart of these challenges is the trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocation of scarce public resources, including renewable energy, transportation, data, computation, etc.. Historical evidence suggests that monetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity -- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this vision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary mechanism for socio-technical control. Karma leverages the repetitive nature of many socio-technical resources to jointly attain trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocations; by budgeting resource consumption over time and letting resource users ``play against their future selves.'' To motivate karma, we review related concepts in economics through a control systems lens, and make a case for a) shifting the viewpoint of resource allocations from single-shot and static to repeated and dynamic games; and b) adopting long-run Nash welfare as the formalization of ``fairness and efficiency'' in socio-technical contexts. We show that in many dynamic resource settings, karma Nash equilibria maximize long-run Nash welfare. Moreover, we discuss implications for a future smart city built on multi-karma economies: by choosing whether to combine different socio-technical resources, e.g., electricity and transportation, in a single karma economy, or separate into resource-specific economies, karma provides new flexibility to design the scope of fairness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Judo: A User-Friendly Open-Source Package for Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in parallel simulation and successful robotic applications are spurring a resurgence in sampling-based model predictive control. To build on this progress, however, the robotics community needs common tooling for prototyping, evaluating, and deploying sampling-based controllers. We introduce Judo, a software package designed to address this need. To facilitate rapid prototyping and evaluation, Judo provides robust implementations of common sampling-based MPC algorithms and standardized benchmark tasks. It further emphasizes usability with simple but extensible interfaces for controller and task definitions, asynchronous execution for straightforward simulation-to-hardware transfer, and a highly customizable interactive GUI for tuning controllers interactively. While written in Python, the software leverages MuJoCo as its physics backend to achieve real-time performance, which we validate across both consumer and server-grade hardware.

      <title>Worst-Case Services and State-Based Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06062v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we shed new light on a classical scheduling problem: given a slot-timed, constant-capacity server, what short-run scheduling decisions must be made to provide long-run service guarantees to competing flows of unit-sized tasks? We model each flow's long-run guarantee as a worst-case service that maps each queued arrival vector recording the flow's cumulative task arrivals, including those initially queued, to a worst-case acceptable departure vector lower-bounding its cumulative served tasks. We show that these maps are states that can be updated as tasks arrive and are served, introduce state-based scheduling, find the schedulability condition necessary and sufficient to maintain all flows' long-run guarantees, and use this condition to identify all short-run scheduling decisions that preserve schedulability. Our framework is general but computationally complex. To reduce complexity, we consider three specializations. First, we show that when satisfactory short-run scheduling decisions exist, at least one can be efficiently identified by maximizing the server's capacity slack, a generalization of the earliest-deadline-first rule. Second, we show that a special class of worst-case services, min-plus services, can be efficiently specified and updated using properties of the min-plus algebra. Finally, we show that efficiency can be further improved by restricting attention to a min-plus service subclass, dual-curve services. This last specialization turns out to be a dynamic extension of service curves that maintains all essential features of our framework while approaching near practical viability.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</description>

Abstract: Safely exploring environments with a-priori unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge that restricts the autonomy of robots. While safety is paramount, guarantees on sufficient exploration are also crucial for ensuring autonomous task completion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel safe guaranteed exploration framework using optimal control, which achieves first-of-its-kind results: guaranteed exploration for non-linear systems with finite time sample complexity bounds, while being provably safe with arbitrarily high probability. The framework is general and applicable to many real-world scenarios with complex non-linear dynamics and unknown domains. We improve the efficiency of this general framework by proposing an algorithm, SageMPC, SAfe Guaranteed Exploration using Model Predictive Control. SageMPC leverages three key techniques: i) exploiting a Lipschitz bound, ii) goal-directed exploration, and iii) receding horizon style re-planning, all while maintaining the desired sample complexity, safety and exploration guarantees of the framework. Lastly, we demonstrate safe efficient exploration in challenging unknown environments using SageMPC with a car model.</description>

      <title>Driving Towards Stability and Efficiency: A Variable Time Gap Strategy for Adaptive Cruise Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated vehicle technologies offer a promising avenue for enhancing traffic efficiency, safety, and energy consumption. Among these, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems stand out as a prevalent form of automation on today's roads, with their time gap settings holding paramount importance. While decreasing the average time headway tends to enhance traffic capacity, it simultaneously raises concerns regarding safety and string stability. This study introduces a novel variable time gap feedback control policy aimed at striking a balance between maintaining a minimum time gap setting under equilibrium car-following conditions, thereby improving traffic capacity, while ensuring string stability to mitigate disturbances away from the equilibrium flow. Leveraging nonlinear $H_\infty$ control technique, the strategy employs a variable time gap component as the manipulated control signal, complemented by a constant time gap component that predominates during car-following equilibrium. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated against its constant time-gap counterpart calibrated using field platoon data from the OpenACC dataset. Through numerical and traffic simulations, our findings illustrate that the proposed algorithm effectively dampens perturbations within vehicle platoons, leading to a more efficient and safer mixed traffic flow.</description>

      <title>Conservative Linear Envelopes for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional, Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) provides a value function that encodes the set of states from which a system with bounded control inputs can reach or avoid a target despite any bounded disturbance, and the corresponding robust, optimal control policy. Though powerful, traditional methods for HJR rely on dynamic programming (DP) and suffer from exponential computation growth with respect to state dimension. The recently favored Hopf formula mitigates this ``curse of dimensionality'' by providing an efficient and space-parallelizable approach for solving the reachability problem. However, the Hopf formula can only be applied to linear time-varying systems. To overcome this limitation, we show that the error between a nonlinear system and a linear model can be transformed into an adversarial bounded artificial disturbance. One may then solve the dimension-robust generalized Hopf formula for a linear game with this ``antagonistic error" to perform guaranteed conservative reachability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems; this can be done for problem formulations in which no other HJR method is both computationally feasible and guaranteed. In addition, we offer several technical methods for reducing conservativeness in the analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results through one illustrative example (the controlled Van der Pol system) that can be compared to standard DP, and one higher-dimensional 15D example (a 5-agent pursuit-evasion game with Dubins cars).</description>

      <title>State-Augmented Linear Games with Antagonistic Error for High-Dimensional, Nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) is a popular method for analyzing the liveness and safety of a dynamical system with bounded control and disturbance. The corresponding HJ value function offers a robust controller and characterizes the reachable sets, but is traditionally solved with Dynamic Programming (DP) and limited to systems of dimension less than six. Recently, the space-parallelizeable, generalized Hopf formula has been shown to also solve the HJ value with a nearly three-log increase in dimension limit, but is limited to linear systems. To extend this potential, we demonstrate how state-augmented (SA) spaces, which are well-known for their improved linearization accuracy, may be used to solve tighter, conservative approximations of the value function with any linear model in this SA space. Namely, we show that with a representation of the true dynamics in the SA space, a series of inequalities confirms that the value of a SA linear game with antagonistic error is a conservative envelope of the true value function. It follows that if the optimal controller for the HJ SA linear game with error may succeed, it will also succeed in the true system. Unlike previous methods, this result offers the ability to safely approximate reachable sets and their corresponding controllers with the Hopf formula in a non-convex manner. Finally, we demonstrate this in the slow manifold system for clarity, and in the controlled Van der Pol system with different lifting functions.</description>

Abstract: Designing controllers that are both safe and performant is inherently challenging. This co-optimization can be formulated as a constrained optimal control problem, where the cost function represents the performance criterion and safety is specified as a constraint. While sampling-based methods, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have shown great promise in tackling complex optimal control problems, they often struggle to enforce safety constraints. To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard-MPPI, a novel framework for solving safety-constrained optimal control problems. Our approach integrates Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis within the MPPI sampling process to ensure that all generated samples are provably safe for the system. On the one hand, this integration allows DualGuard-MPPI to enforce strict safety constraints; at the same time, it facilitates a more effective exploration of the environment with the same number of samples, reducing the effective sampling variance and leading to better performance optimization. Through several simulations and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves much higher performance compared to existing MPPI methods, without compromising safety.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Recurrent Network for State-Space Modeling of Gas Pipeline Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a part of the integrated energy system (IES), gas pipeline networks can provide additional flexibility to power systems through coordinated optimal dispatch. An accurate pipeline network model is critical for the optimal operation and control of IESs. However, inaccuracies or unavailability of accurate pipeline parameters often introduce errors in the state-space models of such networks. This paper proposes a physics-informed recurrent network (PIRN) to identify the state-space model of gas pipelines. It fuses sparse measurement data with fluid-dynamic behavior expressed by partial differential equations. By embedding the physical state-space model within the recurrent network, parameter identification becomes an end-to-end PIRN training task. The model can be realized in PyTorch through modifications to a standard RNN backbone. Case studies demonstrate that our proposed PIRN can accurately estimate gas pipeline models from sparse terminal node measurements, providing robust performance and significantly higher parameter efficiency. Furthermore, the identified state-space model of the pipeline network can be seamlessly integrated into optimization frameworks.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based error bounds of bilinear Koopman surrogate models for nonlinear data-driven control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces AUTOBargeSim, a simulation toolbox for autonomous inland vessel guidance and control system design. AUTOBargeSim is developed using MATLAB and provides an easy-to-use introduction to various aspects of autonomous inland navigation, including mapping, modelling, control design, and collision avoidance, through examples and extensively documented code. Applying modular design principles in the simulator structure allows it to be easily modified according to the user's requirements. Furthermore, a GUI interface facilitates a simple and quick execution. Key performance indices for evaluating the performance of the controller and collision avoidance method in confined space are also provided. The current version of AUTOBargeSim attempts to improve reproducibility in the design and simulation of marine systems while serving as a foundation for simulating and evaluating vessel behaviour considering operational, system, and environmental constraints.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Conditional Probability Densities of Time Interval Extrema with Application to Risk-Sensitive Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve the statistical characterization of peak demand. Due to the stationarity assumption of classical extreme value analysis (EVA), existing approaches in the industry apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monte-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monte-Carlo experiments become intractable, and state-of-the-art generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS)-based nonstationary EVA is often impractical due to convergence issues on high-dimensional covariates. This article explores uncharted territories and proposes a novel nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. Compared to GAMLSS, our method automatically discovers and robustly models complex relationships between the covariate and the peak demand density. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a 38% reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</description>

      <title>A Robust Optimization Framework for Flexible Industrial Energy Scheduling: Application to a Cement Plant with Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility, the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial flexibility planning under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Local Differential Privacy for Distributed Stochastic Aggregative Optimization with Guaranteed Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed aggregative optimization underpins many cooperative optimization and multi-agent control systems, where each agent's objective function depends both on its local optimization variable and an aggregate of all agents' optimization variables. Existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches typically require access to accurate gradients of the objective functions, which, however, are often hard to obtain in real-world applications. For example, in machine learning, gradients are commonly contaminated by two main sources of noise: the randomness inherent in sampled data, and the additional variability introduced by mini-batch computations. In addition to the issue of relying on accurate gradients, existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches require agents to share explicit information, which could breach the privacy of participating agents. We propose an algorithm that can solve both problems with existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches: not only can the proposed algorithm guarantee mean-square convergence to an exact optimal solution when the gradients are subject to noise, it also simultaneously ensures rigorous differential privacy, with the cumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of iterations tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm able to guarantee both accurate convergence and rigorous differential privacy in distributed aggregative optimization. Besides characterizing the convergence rates under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex conditions, we also rigorously quantify the cost of differential privacy in terms of convergence rates. Experimental results on personalized machine learning using benchmark datasets confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Fully Digital Relaxation-Aware Analog Programming Technique for HfOx RRAM Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For neuromorphic engineering to emulate the human brain, improving memory density with low power consumption is an indispensable but challenging goal. In this regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their unique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential, durability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog storage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further improving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more challenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To address this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage amplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters fixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like compliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results, with and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory array of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is possible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array level, verified 1000 seconds after programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a fully nonlinear port-Hamiltonian formulation for discrete elastodynamical systems as well as a structure-preserving time discretization. The governing equations are obtained in a variational manner and represent index-1 differential algebraic equations. Performing an index reduction one obtains the port-Hamiltonian state space model, which features the nonlinear strains as an independent state next to position and velocity. Moreover, hyperelastic material behavior is captured in terms of a nonlinear stored energy function. The model exhibits passivity and losslessness and has an underlying symmetry yielding the conservation of angular momentum. We perform temporal discretization using the midpoint discrete gradient, such that the beneficial properties are inherited by the developed time stepping scheme in a discrete sense. The numerical results obtained in a representative example are demonstrated to validate the findings.</description>

Abstract: A study of the dynamics and control for linear and affine hybrid systems subjected to either temporally- or spatially-triggered resets is presented. Hybrid trajectories are capable of degeneracies not found in continuous-time systems namely beating, blocking, and Zeno. These pathologies are commonly avoided by enforcing a lower bound on the time between events. While this constraint is straightforward to implement for temporally-triggered resets, it is impossible to do so for spatially-triggered systems. In particular, linear spatially-triggered hybrid systems always posses trajectories that are beating and blocking while affine systems may also include Zeno trajectories. The hybrid Pontryagin maximum principle is studied in the context of affine hybrid systems. The existence/uniqueness of the induced co-state jump conditions is studied which introduces the notion of strongly and weakly actuated resets. Finally, optimal control in the context of beating and Zeno is discussed. This work concludes with numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Research on leveraging big artificial intelligence model (BAIM) technology to drive the intelligent evolution of wireless networks is emerging. However, breakthroughs in generalization brought about by BAIM techniques mainly occur in natural language processing. There is a lack of a clear technical direction on how to efficiently apply BAIM techniques to wireless systems, which typically have many additional peculiarities. To this end, this paper reviews recent research on BAIM for wireless systems and assesses the current state of the field. It then analyzes and compares the differences between language intelligence and wireless intelligence on multiple levels, including scientific foundations, core usages, and technical details. It highlights the necessity and scientific significance of developing wireless native BAIM technologies, as well as specific issues that need to be considered for technical implementation. Finally, by synthesizing the evolutionary laws of language models with the particularities of wireless systems, this paper provides several instructive methodologies for developing wireless native BAIM.</description>

      <title>JammingSnake: A follow-the-leader continuum robot with variable stiffness based on fiber jamming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Follow-the-leader (FTL) motion is essential for continuum robots operating in fragile and confined environments. It allows the robot to exert minimal force on its surroundings, reducing the risk of damage. This paper presents a novel design of a snake-like robot capable of achieving FTL motion by integrating fiber jamming modules (FJMs). The proposed robot can dynamically adjust its stiffness during propagation and interaction with the environment. An algorithm is developed to independently control the tendon and FJM insertion movements, allowing the robot to maintain its shape while minimizing the forces exerted on surrounding structures. To validate the proposed design, comparative tests were conducted between a traditional tendon-driven robot and the novel design under different configurations. The results demonstrate that our design relies significantly less on contact with the surroundings to maintain its shape. This highlights its potential for safer and more effective operations in delicate environments, such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or industrial in-situ inspection.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandits with Minimum Reward Guarantee Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem, a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible expected reward.
  Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the optimal fair policy and that of the given policy.
  We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between fairness and social welfare regrets.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of robust diffusive stability (RDS) for a pair of coupled stable discrete-time positive linear-time invariant (LTI) systems. We first show that the existence of a common diagonal Lyapunov function is sufficient for RDS and highlight how this condition differs from recent results using linear copositive Lyapunov functions. We also present an extension of these results, showing that the weaker condition of \emph{joint} linear copositive function existence is also sufficient for RDS. Finally, we present two results on RDS for extended Leslie matrices arising in population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at https://github.com/Cherry0302/Enhanced-TR-SCO.</description>
