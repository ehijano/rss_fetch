      <title>Fast and label-free 3D virtual H&amp;E histology via active modulation-assisted dynamic full-field OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathological features are the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, guiding treatment and prognosis. However, standard histopathological process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, while frozen sections have lower accuracy. Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (D-FFOCT) offers rapid histologic information by measuring the subcellular dynamics of fresh, unprocessed tissues. However, D-FFOCT images suffer from abrupt shifts in hue and brightness, which is confusing for pathologists and diminish their interpretability and reliability. Here, we present active phase modulation-assisted D-FFOCT (APMD-FFOCT) to improve the imaging stability and enhance the contrast of static tissues. This enables us to further employ an unsupervised deep learning to convert APMD-FFOCT images into virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained images for the first time. Three-dimensional (3D) virtual H&amp;E-stained images have been obtained at a scanning rate of 1 frame per second, as demonstrated in cancer diagnosis for human central nervous system and breast. The results prove that this new method will play a unique and important role in intraoperative histology.</description>

      <title>ATOMMIC: An Advanced Toolbox for Multitask Medical Imaging Consistency to facilitate Artificial Intelligence applications from acquisition to analysis in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI is revolutionizing MRI along the acquisition and processing chain. Advanced AI frameworks have been developed to apply AI in various successive tasks, such as image reconstruction, quantitative parameter map estimation, and image segmentation. Existing frameworks are often designed to perform tasks independently or are focused on specific models or datasets, limiting generalization. We introduce ATOMMIC, an open-source toolbox that streamlines AI applications for accelerated MRI reconstruction and analysis. ATOMMIC implements several tasks using DL networks and enables MultiTask Learning (MTL) to perform related tasks integrated, targeting generalization in the MRI domain. We first review the current state of AI frameworks for MRI through a comprehensive literature search and by parsing 12,479 GitHub repositories. We benchmark 25 DL models on eight publicly available datasets to present distinct applications of ATOMMIC on accelerated MRI reconstruction, image segmentation, quantitative parameter map estimation, and joint accelerated MRI reconstruction and image segmentation utilizing MTL. Our findings demonstrate that ATOMMIC is the only MTL framework with harmonized complex-valued and real-valued data support. Evaluations on single tasks show that physics-based models, which enforce data consistency by leveraging the physical properties of MRI, outperform other models in reconstructing highly accelerated acquisitions. Physics-based models that produce high reconstruction quality can accurately estimate quantitative parameter maps. When high-performing reconstruction models are combined with robust segmentation networks utilizing MTL, performance is improved in both tasks. ATOMMIC facilitates MRI reconstruction and analysis by standardizing workflows, enhancing data interoperability, integrating unique features like MTL, and effectively benchmarking DL models.</description>

      <title>Advancing low-field MRI with a universal denoising imaging transformer: Towards fast and high-quality imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in low-field (LF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems present remarkable opportunities for affordable and widespread MRI access. A robust denoising method to overcome the intrinsic low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) barrier is critical to the success of LF MRI. However, current data-driven MRI denoising methods predominantly handle magnitude images and rely on customized models with constrained data diversity and quantity, which exhibit limited generalizability in clinical applications across diverse MRI systems, pulse sequences, and organs. In this study, we present ImT-MRD: a complex-valued imaging transformer trained on a vast number of clinical MRI scans aiming at universal MR denoising at LF systems. Compared with averaging multiple-repeated scans for higher image SNR, the model obtains better image quality from fewer repetitions, demonstrating its capability for accelerating scans under various clinical settings. Moreover, with its complex-valued image input, the model can denoise intermediate results before advanced post-processing and prepare high-quality data for further MRI research. By delivering universal and accurate denoising across clinical and research tasks, our model holds great promise to expedite the evolution of LF MRI for accessible and equal biomedical applications.</description>
