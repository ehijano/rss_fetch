      <title>Numerical study of the effect of the relative mobilities of chemical components on the Non solvent induced phase separation process for membrane elaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filtration membranes are often elaborated through a phase separation process where a polymer rich phase and a polymer poor phase spontaneously form through spinodal decomposition. One process that is still not well understood from a theoretical point of view is the Non-Solvent induced phase separation where a thermodynamically stable film of a a polymer mixture is put in contact with a bad solvent of the polymer. The invasion of the film by this non-solvent drives the film out of stability and leads to spinodal decomposition. During this phase separation polymer poor and polymer rich regions form. In this article we present a numerical study of the effect of kinetic coefficients: namely the relative mobilities of polymer and solvent/non-solvent on the observed patterns. Using 2D numerical simulations of the ternary Cahn-Hilliard model we show that for a given thermodynamic landscape, this parameter has dramatic effects: depending on its value phase separation can be observed or not. We also show that it can affect the nature of the observed pattern. In addition analysing 3D simulations we analyse the final pattern using a quantitative indicator of its connectivity and show that for a wide range of initial composition of the film the final pattern is bicontinuous. We also quantify the transport properties of both polymer rich and polymer poor domains.</description>

      <title>Circulation of Elites in an Adaptive Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Societies experience politically stable and unstable phases along history, whereas political power is usually passed to new elite groups by these changes. Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information.</description>

      <title>Non-randomness of Japan megaquakes implied by stress recovery and accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes' rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.</description>
