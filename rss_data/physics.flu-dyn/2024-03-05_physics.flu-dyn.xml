      <title>Iterative Methods for Navier--Stokes Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even when the partial differential equation underlying a physical process can be evolved forward in time, the retrospective (backward in time) inverse problem often has its own challenges and applications. Direct Adjoint Looping (DAL) is the defacto approach for solving retrospective inverse problems, but it has not been applied to deterministic retrospective Navier--Stokes inverse problems in 2D or 3D. In this paper, we demonstrate that DAL is ill-suited for solving retrospective 2D Navier--Stokes inverse problems. Alongside DAL, we study two other iterative methods: Simple Backward Integration (SBI) and the Quasi-Reversible Method (QRM). Our iterative SBI approach is novel while iterative QRM has previously been used. Using these three iterative methods, we solve two retrospective inverse problems: 1D Korteweg--de Vries--Burgers (decaying nonlinear wave) and 2D Navier--Stokes (unstratified Kelvin--Helmholtz vortex). In both cases, SBI and QRM reproduce the target final states more accurately and in fewer iterations than DAL. We attribute this performance gap to additional terms present in SBI and QRM's respective backward integrations which are absent in DAL.</description>

      <title>Droplet dynamics in homogeneous isotropic turbulence with the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulating the dynamics of a droplet immersed in a generic time-dependent velocity gradient field. This approach is grounded on the hybrid coupling between the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, employed for the flow simulation, and the immersed boundary (IB) method, utilized to couple the droplet with the surrounding fluid. We show how to enrich the numerical scheme with a mesh regularization technique, allowing droplets to sustain large deformations. The resulting methodology is adapted to simulate the dynamics of droplets in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, with the characteristic size of the droplet being smaller than the characteristic Kolmogorov scale of the outer turbulent flow. We report on statistical results for droplet deformation and orientation, collected from an ensemble of turbulent trajectories, as well as comparisons with theoretical models in the limit of small deformation.</description>

      <title>Volume diffusion modelling of a sheared granular gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum fluid dynamic models based on the Navier-Stokes equations have previously been used to simulate granular media undergoing fluid-like shearing. These models, however, typically fail to predict the flow behaviour in confined environments as non-equilibrium particle effects dominate near walls. We adapt an extended hydrodynamic model for granular flows, which uses a density-gradient dependent ``volume diffusion'' term to correct the viscous stress tensor and heat flux, to simulate the shearing of a granular gas between two rough walls, and with corresponding boundary conditions. We use our volume diffusion model to predict channel flows for a range of mean volume fraction $\bar{\phi}=0.01$--$0.4$, and inter-particle coefficients of restitution $e=0.8$ and $0.9$, and compare with Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations and classical Navier-Stokes equations. Our model is capable of predicting non-uniform pressure, volume fraction and granular temperature, which become more significant for cases with mean volume fraction $\bar{\phi}\sim0.1$, in which we typically observe non-uniform peak density variations, and large volume fraction gradients.</description>

      <title>Self-Lubricating Drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in the study of multicomponent drops. These drops exhibit unique phenomena, as the interplay between hydrodynamics and the evolving physicochemical properties of the mixture gives rise to distinct and often unregulated behaviors. Of particular interest is the complex dynamic behavior of the drop contact line, which can display self-lubrication effect. The presence of a slipping contact line in self-lubricating multicomponent drops can suppress the coffee-stain effect, conferring valuable technological applications. This review will explain the current understanding of the self-lubrication effect of drops, and cover an analysis of fundamental concepts and recent advances in colloidal assembly. The potential applications of self-lubricating drops across different fields will also be highlighted.</description>

      <title>Temperature, Pressure, Velocity, and Water Vapor Mole Fraction Profiles in a Ramjet Combustor using Dual Frequency Comb Spectroscopy and a High Temperature Absorption Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnostics of the combustor region of ramjet engines can improve engine design and create benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics models. Previous works demonstrate that dual frequency comb spectroscopy can provide low uncertainty diagnostics of multiple flow parameters in the non-combusting regions of ramjets. However, the high temperatures present in the combustor present a challenge for broadband spectroscopic absorption models that are used to interpret measurements in these regions. Here, we utilize a new water vapor absorption database created for high temperature water-air mixtures to fit spectra measured in a ground-test ramjet engine with a broadband near-infrared dual comb absorption spectrometer. We extract 2D profiles of pressure, temperature, water mole fraction, and velocity using this new database. We demonstrate that the new database provides the lowest fit residuals compared to other water vapor absorption databases. We compare computational fluid dynamics simulations of the combustor with the measured data to demonstrate that the simulations overpredict heat release and water vapor production.</description>

      <title>A face-centred finite volume method for laminar and turbulent incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops, for the first time, a face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver for the simulation of laminar and turbulent viscous incompressible flows. The formulation relies on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the negative Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model and three novel convective stabilisations, inspired by Riemann solvers, are derived and compared numerically. The resulting method achieves first-order convergence of the velocity, the velocity-gradient tensor and the pressure. FCFV accurately predicts engineering quantities of interest, such as drag and lift, on unstructured meshes and, by avoiding gradient reconstruction, the method is insensitive to mesh quality, even in the presence of highly distorted and stretched cells. A monolithic and a staggered solution strategies for the RANS-SA system are derived and compared numerically. Numerical benchmarks, involving laminar and turbulent, steady and transient cases are used to assess the performance, accuracy and robustness of the proposed FCFV method.</description>

      <title>Color-switching hydrogels as integrated microfluidic pressure sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely measuring pressure in microfluidic flows is essential for flow control, fluid characterization, and monitoring, but faces specific challenges such as \RE{achieving} sufficient resolution, non-invasiveness, or ease of use. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated multiplexed optofluidic pressure sensor, entirely decoupled from the flow path, that enables local pressure measurements along any microfluidic channel without altering its flow geometry. The sensor itself relies on the compression of a soft mechano-actuated hydrogel, changing color in response to a pressure change. The hydrogel is separated from the fluid circulating in the channel by a thin membrane, allowing for the unrestricted use of different types of fluids. Imaging the gel through the transparent PDMS with a color camera provides a direct, easy, and contact-free determination of the fluid pressure at the sensing location for pressures as small as \SI{20}{\milli\bar} with a resolution of around \SI{10}{\milli\bar}. The sensitivity and accessible pressure range can be tuned via the mechanical properties \RE{of the sensing unit}. The photonic gel can also be used to acquire 2D pressure or deformation maps, taking advantage of the fast response time and fine spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Effect of Feathers on Drag in Plunge Diving Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of feathers on the hydrodynamic drag experienced by diving birds, which is critical to their foraging efficiency and survival. Employing a novel experimental approach, we analyzed the kinematics of both feathered and non-feathered projectiles during their transition from air to water using high-speed imaging and an onboard accelerometer. The drag coefficients were determined through two methods: a direct calculation from the acceleration data and a theoretical approach fitted to the observed velocity profiles. Our results indicate that feathers significantly increase the drag force during water entry, with feathered projectiles exhibiting approximately double the drag coefficient of their smooth counterparts. These findings provide new insights into the role of avian feather morphology in diving mechanics and have potential implications for the design of bio-inspired aquatic vehicles in engineering. The study also discusses the biological implications of increased drag due to feathers and suggests that factors such as body shape might play a more critical role in the diving capabilities of birds than previously understood.</description>

      <title>Understanding Latent Timescales in Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Models for Advection-Dominated Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework has shown promise in developing accelerated surrogate models for complex systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In PDE-based systems, neural ODE strategies use a two-step approach for acceleration: a nonlinear dimensionality reduction via an autoencoder, and a time integration step through a neural-network based model (neural ODE). This study explores the effectiveness of autoencoder-based neural ODE strategies for advection-dominated PDEs. It includes predictive demonstrations and delves into the sources of model acceleration, focusing on how neural ODEs achieve this. The research quantifies the impact of autoencoder and neural ODE components on system time-scales through eigenvalue analysis of dynamical system Jacobians. It examines how various training parameters, like training methods, latent space dimensionality, and training trajectory length, affect model accuracy and latent time-scales. Particularly, it highlights the influence of training trajectory length on neural ODE time-scales, noting that longer trajectories enhance limiting time-scales, with optimal neural ODEs capturing the largest time-scales of the actual system. The study conducts demonstrations on two distinct unsteady fluid dynamics settings influenced by advection: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations and Hydrogen-Air channel detonations, using the compressible reacting Navier--Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Zonostrophic turbulence in the subsurface oceans of the Jovian and Saturnian moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to characterize the global circulation of the subsurface ocean of Jovian and Saturnian moons, we analyze the properties of 21 three-dimensional simulations of Boussinesq thermal convection in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. Flow is driven by an adverse temperature contrast imposed across the domain, and is subjected to no-slip boundary conditions. We cover a region of parameter space previously unexplored by global simulations, both in terms of rapid rotation and vigor of convective forcing, closer to, yet still admittedly far from, the conditions appropriate for the subsurface ocean of Ganymede, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Our most extreme simulations exhibit a dynamic global circulation that combines powerful east-west zonal jets, planetary waves, and vortices. A spectral analysis of the kinetic energy distribution performed in cylindrical geometry reveals a high degree of anisotropy of the simulated flows. Specifically, the axisymmetric zonal energy spectra follow a steep $-5$ slope in wavenumber space, with the energy amplitude exclusively controlled by the rotation rate. In contrast, the non-axisymmetric residual spectra display a gentle $-5/3$ slope, with the energy amplitude controlled by the thermal buoyancy input power. This spectral behavior conforms with the theory of zonostrophic turbulence and allows us to propose tentative extrapolations of these findings to the more extreme conditions of icy satellites. By assuming that kinetic energy dissipates via Ekman friction we predict an upper bound for the zonal velocity ranging from a few centimeters per second for Enceladus to about one meter per second for Ganymede, with residual velocities smaller than the zonal velocity by an order of magnitude on each moon. These predictions yield typical jets size approaching the ocean depth of Titan, Ganymede and Europa and $10$ to $40\%$ of the ocean depth on Enceladus.</description>

      <title>A new HOC scheme for computation of flow and heat transfer in nonuniform polar grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HOC scheme for 2D transient CDE on Cartesian coordinates reported in [1] is extended to cylindrical polar coordinates on nonuniform grids to investigate fluid flow and heat transfer around bluff bodies. In contrast to the most of HOC schemes developed on polar coordinates, as available in the literature, there is no necessity to transform domain for the present scheme. We begin the study by employing our scheme to two test problems having analytical solutions, followed by time marching simulation for driven polar cavity and natural convection in horizontal concentric annulus. In the process, a one-sided approximation for the Neumann boundary condition for vorticity is also developed. The scheme is found to be well capable of handling complex flow patterns as it combines the advantages of body fitted mesh as well as nonuniformity of grids. The scheme reported a second-order temporal convergence and in space it approached to fourth order convergence for problems with analytical solutions. For the cases where no analytical solutions are available, we have determined the perceived rate of convergence in space for all the variables. The computed values of various flow parameters are being compared to the values available in the literature. Results are extremely close to the available numerical and experimental results in all the cases, both qualitative and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Jupiter's Polar Vortex Crystals Explored using the Shallow Water Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the poles of Jupiter, cyclonic vortices are clustered together in patterns made up of equilateral triangles called vortex crystals. Such patterns are seen in laboratory flows but never before in a planetary atmosphere, where the planet's rotation and gravity add new physics. Here we use the shallow water (SW) equations at the pole of a rotating planet to study the emergence and evolution of vortices starting from an initial random pattern of small-scale turbulence. The flow is in a single layer with a free surface whose slope produces the horizontal pressure gradient force. We explored three parameters in the problem: the mean kinetic energy of the initial turbulence, the horizontal scale of the initial turbulence, and the radius of deformation of the undisturbed fluid layer. We find that some regions of this parameter space lead to vortex crystals and others lead to chaotic behavior and mergers. Our results identified that the relative change of the layer thickness is the key quantity that determines whether the vortex crystal or chaotic patterns emerge.</description>

      <title>Efficient Alternative Finite Difference WENO Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order finite difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes for conservation laws are extremely popular because, for multidimensional problems, they offer high order accuracy at a fraction of the cost of finite volume WENO or DG schemes. Such schemes come in two formulations. The very popular classical finite difference WENO (FD-WENO) method (Shu and Osher, J. Comput. Phys., 83 (1989) 32-78) relies two reconstruction steps applied to two split fluxes. However, the method cannot accommodate different types of Riemann solvers and cannot preserve free stream boundary conditions on curvilinear meshes. This limits its utility. The alternative finite difference WENO (AFD-WENO) method can overcome these deficiencies, however, much less work has been done on this method. The reasons are three-fold. First, it is difficult for the casual reader to understand the intricate logic that requires higher order derivatives of the fluxes to be evaluated at zone boundaries. The analytical methods for deriving the update equation for AFD-WENO schemes are somewhat recondite. To overcome that difficulty, we provide an easily accessible script that is based on a computer algebra system in Appendix A of this paper. Second, the method relies on interpolation rather than reconstruction, and WENO interpolation formulae have not been documented in the literature as thoroughly as WENO reconstruction formulae. In this paper, we explicitly provide all necessary WENO interpolation formulae that are needed for implementing AFD-WENO up to ninth order. The third reason is that AFD-WENO requires higher order derivatives of the fluxes to be available at zone boundaries. Since those derivatives are usually obtained by finite differencing the zone-centered fluxes, they become susceptible to a Gibbs phenomenon when the solution ...</description>

      <title>Efficient Alternative Finite Difference WENO Schemes for Hyperbolic Systems with Non-Conservative Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order finite difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes for conservation laws represent a technology that has been reasonably consolidated. They are extremely popular because, when applied to multidimensional problems, they offer high order accuracy at a fraction of the cost of finite volume WENO or DG schemes. They come in two flavors. There is the classical finite difference WENO (FD-WENO) method (Shu and Osher, J. Comput. Phys., 83 (1989) 32-78). However, in recent years there is also an alternative finite difference WENO (AFD-WENO) method which has recently been formalized into a very useful general-purpose algorithm for conservation laws (Balsara et al., Efficient Alternative Finite Difference WENO Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws, submitted to CAMC (2023)). However, the FD-WENO algorithm has only very recently been formulated for hyperbolic systems with non-conservative products (Balsara et al., Efficient Finite Difference WENO Scheme for Hyperbolic Systems with Non-Conservative Products, to appear CAMC (2023)). In this paper we show that there are substantial advantages in obtaining an AFD-WENO algorithm for hyperbolic systems with non-conservative products. Such an algorithm is documented in this paper. We present an AFD-WENO formulation in fluctuation form that is carefully engineered to retrieve the flux form when that is warranted and nevertheless extends to non-conservative products. The method is flexible because it allows any Riemann solver to be used. The formulation we arrive at is such that when non-conservative products are absent it reverts exactly to the formulation in the second citation above which is in exact flux conservation form. The ability to transition to a precise conservation form when non-conservative products are absent ensures, via the Lax-Wendroff theorem, that shock locations will be exactly ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial and environmental monitoring, achieving real-time and precise fluid flow measurement remains a critical challenge. This study applies linear quantization in FPGA-based soft sensors for fluid flow estimation, significantly enhancing Neural Network model precision by overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed-point quantization. Our approach achieves up to a 10.10% reduction in Mean Squared Error and a notable 9.39% improvement in inference speed through targeted hardware optimizations. Validated across multiple data sets, our findings demonstrate that the optimized FPGA-based quantized models can provide efficient, accurate real-time inference, offering a viable alternative to cloud-based processing in pervasive autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>A generalized hybrid method for surfactant dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generalized hybrid method for both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) surfactant dynamics. While the Navier-Stokes equations are solved by the Eulerian method, the surfactant transport is tracked by a Lagrangian particle method, in which the remeshing technique is employed to prevent particle clustering. For the mass redistribution during remeshing, the redistribution weight is selected with weighted least squares, which shares the theoretical basis of the moving least squares method (MLS) and enables the present hybrid method to work in both 2-D and 3-D cases. This optimized mass redistribution effectively strengthens the robustness of the present hybrid method, as validated by 2-D topological changes of the dumbbell. The conservation, accuracy, and convergence of the present hybrid method have also been validated with both 2-D and 3-D test cases, including a translation circle/sphere, a deformed circle/sphere in the shear flow, and droplet deformation.</description>

      <title>Trapped Free Surface Waves for a Lamb-Oseen Vortex Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped surface waves have been observed in a swimming pool trapped by, and rotating around, the cores of vortices. To investigate this effect, we have numerically studied the free-surface response of a Lamb-Oseen vortex to small perturbations. The fluid has finite depth but is laterally unbounded. The numerical method used is spectrally accurate, and uses a novel non-reflecting buffer region to simulate a laterally unbounded fluid. While a variety of linear waves can arise in this flow, we focus here on surface gravity waves. We investigate the linear modes of the vortex as a function of the perturbation azimuthal mode number and the vortex rotation rate. We find that at low rotation rates, linear modes decay by radiating energy to the far field, while at higher rotation rates modes become nearly neutrally stable and trapped in the vicinity of the vortex. While trapped modes have previously been seen in shallow water surface waves due to small perturbations of a bathtub vortex, the situation considered here is qualitatively different owing to the lack of an inward flow and the dispersive nature of non-shallow-water waves. We also find that for slow vortex rotation rates, trapped waves propagate in the opposite direction to the vortex rotation, whereas, above a threshold rotation rate, waves co-rotate with the flow.</description>

      <title>Saturation and multifractality of Lagrangian and Eulerian scaling exponents in 3D isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial range scaling exponents for both Lagrangian and Eulerian structure functions are obtained from direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence in triply periodic domains at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up to 1300. We reaffirm that transverse Eulerian scaling exponents saturate at $\approx 2.1$ for moment orders $p \ge 10$, significantly differing from the longitudinal exponents (which are predicted to saturate at $\approx 7.3$ for $p \ge 30$ from a recent theory). The Lagrangian scaling exponents likewise saturate at $\approx 2$ for $p \ge 8$. The saturation of Lagrangian exponents and transverse Eulerian exponents is related by the same multifractal spectrum by utilizing the well known frozen hypothesis to relate spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this spectrum is different from the known spectra for Eulerian longitudinal exponents, suggesting that that Lagrangian intermittency is characterized solely by transverse Eulerian intermittency. We discuss possible implication of this outlook when extending multifractal predictions to the dissipation range, especially for Lagrangian acceleration.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the force-coupling method for hydrodynamic interactions in periodic domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of fluid-structure interactions at zero Reynolds number requires the use of fast summation techniques in order to rapidly compute the long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions between the structures. One approach for periodic domains involves utilising a compact or exponentially decaying kernel function to spread the force on the structure to a regular grid where the resulting flow and interactions can be computed efficiently using an FFT-based solver. A limitation to this approach is that the grid spacing must be chosen to resolve the kernel and thus, these methods can become inefficient when the separation between the structures is large compared to the kernel width. In this paper, we address this issue for the force-coupling method (FCM) by introducing a modified kernel that can be resolved on a much coarser grid, and subsequently correcting the resulting interactions in a pairwise fashion. The modified kernel is constructed to ensure rapid convergence to the exact hydrodynamic interactions and a positive-splitting of the associated mobility matrix. We provide a detailed computational study of the methodology and establish the optimal choice of the modified kernel width, which we show plays a similar role to the splitting parameter in Ewald summation. Finally, we perform example simulations of rod sedimentation and active filament coordination to demonstrate the performance of fast FCM in application.</description>

      <title>Flutter Limitation of Drag Reduction by Elastic Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through experiments, we idealise a plant leaf as a flexible, thin, rectangular plate clamped at the midpoint and positioned perpendicular to an airflow. Flexibility of the structure is considered as an advantage at moderate flow speed because it allows drag reduction by elastic reconfiguration, but it can also be at the origin of several flow-induced vibration phenomena at higher flow speeds. A wind tunnel campaign is conducted to identify the limitation to elastic reconfiguration that dynamic instability imposes. Here we show by increasing the flow speed that the flexibility permits a considerable drag reduction by reconfiguration, compared to the rigid case. However, beyond the stability limit, vibrations occur and limit the reconfiguration. This limit is represented by two dimensionless numbers: the mass number, and the Cauchy number. Our results reveal the existence of a critical Cauchy number below which static reconfiguration with drag reduction is possible and above which a dynamic instability with important fluctuating loads is present. The critical dimensionless velocity is dependant on the mass number. Flexibility is related to the critical reduced velocity, and allows defining an optimal flexibility for the structure that leads to a drag reduction by reconfiguration while avoiding dynamic instability. Furthermore, experiments show that our flexible structure can exhibit two vibration modes: symmetric and anti-symmetric, depending on its mass number. Because the system we consider is bluff yet aligned with the flow, it is unclear whether the vibrations are due to a flutter instability or vortex-induced vibration or a combination of both phenomena.</description>

      <title>Solving the Discretised Multiphase Flow Equations with Interface Capturing on Structured Grids Using Machine Learning Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper solves the discretised multiphase flow equations using tools and methods from machine-learning libraries. The idea comes from the observation that convolutional layers can be used to express a discretisation as a neural network whose weights are determined by the numerical method, rather than by training, and hence, we refer to this approach as Neural Networks for PDEs (NN4PDEs). To solve the discretised multiphase flow equations, a multigrid solver is implemented through a convolutional neural network with a U-Net architecture. Immiscible two-phase flow is modelled by the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with surface tension and advection of a volume fraction field, which describes the interface between the fluids. A new compressive algebraic volume-of-fluids method is introduced, based on a residual formulation using Petrov-Galerkin for accuracy and designed with NN4PDEs in mind. High-order finite-element based schemes are chosen to model a collapsing water column and a rising bubble. Results compare well with experimental data and other numerical results from the literature, demonstrating that, for the first time, finite element discretisations of multiphase flows can be solved using an approach based on (untrained) convolutional neural networks. A benefit of expressing numerical discretisations as neural networks is that the code can run, without modification, on CPUs, GPUs or the latest accelerators designed especially to run AI codes.</description>

      <title>Vapour compression and energy dissipation in a collapsing laser-induced bubble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition of the gaseous phase of cavitation bubbles and its role on the collapse remains to date poorly understood. In this work, experiments of single cavitation bubbles in aqueous ammonia serve as a novel approach to investigate the effect of the vapour contained in a bubble on its collapse. We find that the higher vapour pressure of more concentrated aqueous ammonia acts as a resistance to the collapse, reducing the total energy dissipation. In line with visual observation, acoustic measurements, and luminescence recordings, it is also observed that higher vapour pressures contribute to a more spherical collapse, likely hindering the growth of interface instabilities by decreasing the collapse velocities and accelerations. Remarkably, we evidence a strong difference between the effective damping and the energy of the shock emission, suggesting that the latter is not the dominant dissipation mechanism at collapse as predicted from classical correction models accounting for slightly compressible liquids. Furthermore, our results suggest that the vapour inside collapsing bubbles gets compressed, consistently with previous studies performed in the context of single bubble sonoluminescence, addressing the question about the ability of vapours to readily condense during a bubble collapse in similar regimes. These findings provide insights into the identification of the influence of the bubble content and the energy exchanges of the bubble with its surrounding media, eventually paving the way to a more efficient use of cavitation in engineering and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Compressible single-phase flows in heated and cooled ducts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical/quasi-analytical solutions are proposed for a steady, compressible, single-phase flow in a rectilinear duct subjected to heating followed by cooling. The flow is driven by the pressure ratio between an upstream tank and a variable outlet pressure. The article proposes a methodology to determine the full flow behavior, as a function of pressure ratio and heat-flux distribution. Following an analogy done with the study of compressible flows in nozzles, a behavioral classification of non-adiabatic compressible flows is proposed through the definition of critical pressure ratios. It is demonstrated that a critical pressure ratio distinguishes subsonic and supersonic outlet regimes and that there cannot be a steady shock-wave in such configuration. The behavior of this critical pressure ratio is studied for limit cases of heat-flux, delineating physical boundaries. An abacus is also proposed for a given couple of heating and cooling powers, as both values are needed to characterize the flow. Results are studied for parameters such as pressure ratio and outlet heat power. A short validation of a numerical simulation tool is provided, yielding excellent results and very small relative errors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we parallel the construction of Tong of a gauge theory for shallow water, by writing a gauge theory for the Euler fluid in 2+1 dimensions. We then extend it to an Euler fluid coupled to electromagnetic background. We argue that the gauge theory formulation provides a topological argument for the quantization of 2+1 dimensional Euler Hopfion solution. In the process, we find a (non-gauge) action for the Euler fluid that can be extended to any dimension, including the physical 3+1 dimensions. We discuss several aspects of the ABC flow.</description>

Abstract: Active matter drives its constituent agents to move autonomously by harnessing free energy, leading to diverse emergent states with relevance to both biological processes and inanimate functionalities. Achieving maximum reconfigurability of active materials with minimal control remains a desirable yet challenging goal. Here, we employ large-scale, agent-resolved simulations to demonstrate that modulating the activity of a wet phoretic medium alone can govern its solid-liquid-gas phase transitions and, subsequently, laminar-turbulent transitions in fluid phases, thereby shaping its emergent pattern. These two progressively emerging transitions, hitherto unreported, bring us closer to perceiving the parallels between active matter and traditional matter. Our work reproduces and reconciles seemingly conflicting experimental observations on chemically active systems, presenting a unified landscape of phoretic collective dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of long-range, many-body interactions among phoretic agents, offer new insights into their non-equilibrium collective behaviors, and provide potential guidelines for designing reconfigurable materials.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Fine-Tuning for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate modeling has surged in capability in recent years with the emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs), which can operate directly on mesh-based representations of data. The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretable fine-tuning strategy for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. The end result is an enhanced fine-tuned model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures, identified by the fine-tuned GNNs, are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the fine-tuned GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>A Posteriori Evaluation of a Physics-Constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equations Approach Coupled with CFD Solver for Modeling Stiff Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high computational cost associated with solving for detailed chemistry poses a significant challenge for predictive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of turbulent reacting flows. These models often require solving a system of coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While deep learning techniques have been experimented with to develop faster surrogate models, they often fail to integrate reliably with CFD solvers. This instability arises because deep learning methods optimize for training error without ensuring compatibility with ODE solvers, leading to accumulation of errors over time. Recently, NeuralODE-based techniques have offered a promising solution by effectively modeling chemical kinetics. In this study, we extend the NeuralODE framework for stiff chemical kinetics by incorporating mass conservation constraints directly into the loss function during training. This ensures that the total mass and the elemental mass are conserved, a critical requirement for reliable downstream integration with CFD solvers. Proof-of-concept studies are performed with physics-constrained neuralODE (PC-NODE) approach for homogeneous autoignition of hydrogen-air mixture over a range of composition and thermodynamic conditions. Our results demonstrate that this enhancement not only improves the physical consistency with respect to mass conservation criteria but also ensures better robustness. Lastly, a posteriori studies are performed wherein the trained PC-NODE model is coupled with a 3D CFD solver for computing the chemical source terms. PC-NODE is shown to be more accurate relative to the purely data-driven neuralODE approach. Moreover, PC-NODE also exhibits robustness and generalizability to unseen initial conditions from within (interpolative capability) as well as outside (extrapolative capability) the training regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is widely recognized as an efficient algorithm for simulating fluid flows in both single-phase and multi-phase scenarios. In this research, a quantum Carleman Linearization formulation of the Lattice Boltzmann equation is described, employing the Bhatnagar Gross and Krook equilibrium function. Our approach addresses the treatment of boundary conditions with the commonly used bounce back scheme.
  The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulating flow past a rectangular prism, achieving agreement with respect to fluid velocity In comparison to classical LBM simulations. This improved formulation showcases the potential to provide computational speed-ups in a wide range of fluid flow applications.
  Additionally, we provide details on read in and read out techniques.</description>
