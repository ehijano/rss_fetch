      <title>Fast biological imaging with quantum-enhanced Raman microscopy</title>

Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful label-free imaging technique that probes the vibrational response of chemicals with high specificity and sensitivity. High-power, quantum-enhanced SRS microscopes have been recently demonstrated and applied to polymers and biological samples. Quantum correlations, in the form of squeezed light, enable the microscopes to operate below the shot noise limit, enhancing their performance without increasing the illumination intensity. This addresses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speed constraints introduced by photodamage in shot noise-limited microscopes. Previous microscopes have either used single-beam squeezing, but with insufficient brightness to reach the optimal ratio of pump-to-Stokes intensity for maximum SNR, or have used twin-beam squeezing and suffered a 3 dB noise penalty. Here we report a quantum-enhanced Raman microscope that uses a bright squeezed single-beam, enabling operation at the optimal efficiency of the SRS process. The increase in brightness leads to multimode effects that degrade the squeezing level, which we partially overcome using spatial filtering. We apply our quantum-enhanced SRS microscope to biological samples, and demonstrate quantum-enhanced multispectral imaging of living cells. The imaging speed of 100x100 pixels in 18 seconds allows the dynamics of cell organelles to be resolved. The SNR achieved is compatible with video rate imaging, with the quantum correlations yielding a 20% improvement in imaging speed compared to shot noise limited operation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic nanoswimmer: a multistate model for enzyme self-propulsion and enhanced diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several enzymes show enhanced diffusion in the presence of substrate a feature that is explained by postulating that the enzyme in the bound state has a higher diffusion constant than in the unbound state. In a recent experiment [Jee et al. PNAS, 115, E10812 (2018)], it was observed that some of these enzymes perform a run-and-tumble motion, where the self-propulsion velocities can be of the order of mm/s. Theoretical models of nanoscale swimmers have not been able to explain the high self-propulsion speeds measured in experiments. Here we model the enzyme as a dimer with fluctuating mobility. We show that even a dimer can perform a run-and-tumble motion when the dimer switches between states of different mobility in the enzymatic cycle. Within a three-state enzymatic cycle, we investigate the conditions under which self-propulsion speeds consistent with experiments can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Open quantum system simulation of time and frequency resolved spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of excitonic energy transfer in molecular complexes triggered by interaction with laser pulses offers a unique window into the underlying physical processes. The absorbed energy moves through the network of interlinked pigments and in photosynthetic complexes reaches a reaction center. The efficiency and time-scale depend not only on the excitonic couplings, but are also affected by the dissipation of energy to vibrational modes of the molecules. An open quantum system description provides a suitable tool to describe the involved processes and connects the decoherence and relaxation dynamics to measurements of the time-dependent polarization.</description>

      <title>Pattern selection and the route to turbulence in incompressible polar active fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids, such as suspensions of microswimmers, are known to self-organize into complex spatio-temporal flow patterns. An intriguing example is mesoscale turbulence, a state of dynamic vortex structures exhibiting a characteristic length scale. Here, we employ a minimal model for the effective microswimmer velocity field to explore how the turbulent state develops from regular vortex patterns when the strength of activity resp. related parameters such as nonlinear advection or polar alignment strength - is increased. First, we demonstrate analytically that the system, without any spatial constraints, develops a stationary square vortex lattice in the absence of nonlinear advection. Subsequently, we perform an extended stability analysis of this nonuniform "ground state" and uncover a linear instability, which follows from the mutual excitement and simultaneous growth of multiple perturbative modes. This extended analysis is based on linearization around an approximation of the analytical vortex lattice solution and allows us to calculate critical activity parameters. Above these critical values, the vortex lattice develops into mesoscale turbulence in numerical simulations. Utilizing the numerical approach, we uncover an extended region of hysteresis where both patterns are possible depending on the initial condition. Here, we find that turbulence persists below the instability of the vortex lattice. We further determine the stability of square vortex patterns as a function of their wavenumber and represent the results analogous to the well-known Busse balloons known from classical pattern-forming systems. Here, the region of stable periodic patterns shrinks and eventually disappears with increasing activity parameters. Our results show that the strength of activity plays a similar role for active turbulence as the Reynolds number does in driven flow exhibiting inertial turbulence.</description>

      <title>Active transport of a passive colloid in a bath of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion of a passive colloid immersed in a bath of non-interacting and non-Brownian run-and-tumble microswimmers in two dimensions is analyzed using stochastic simulations and an asymptotic theory, both based on a minimal model of swimmer-colloid collisions characterized solely by frictionless steric interactions. We estimate the effective long-time diffusivity $\mathcal{D}$ of the suspended colloid resulting from its interaction with the active bath, and elucidate its dependence on the level of activity (persistence length of swimmer trajectories), the mobility ratio of the colloid to a swimmer, and the number density of swimmers in the bath. We also propose a semi-analytical model for the colloid diffusivity in terms of the variance and correlation time of the net fluctuating active force on the colloid resulting from swimmer collisions. Quantitative agreement is found between numerical simulations and analytical results in the experimentally-relevant regime of low swimmer density, low mobility ratios, and high activity.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Validation of the DESIGNER dMRI preprocessing pipeline in white matter aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14445</link>

Abstract: Various diffusion MRI (dMRI) preprocessing pipelines are currently available to yield more accurate diffusion parameters. Here, we evaluated accuracy and robustness of the optimized Diffusion parameter EStImation with Gibbs and NoisE Removal (DESIGNER) pipeline in a large clinical dMRI dataset and using ground truth phantoms. DESIGNER has been modified to improve denoising and target Gibbs ringing for partial Fourier acquisitions. We compared the revisited DESIGNER (Dv2) (including denoising, Gibbs removal, correction for motion, EPI distortion, and eddy currents) against the original DESIGNER (Dv1) pipeline, minimal preprocessing (including correction for motion, EPI distortion, and eddy currents only), and no preprocessing on a large clinical dMRI dataset of 524 control subjects with ages between 25 and 75 years old. We evaluated the effect of specific processing steps on age correlations in white matter with DTI and DKI metrics. We also evaluated the added effect of minimal Gaussian smoothing to deal with noise and to reduce outliers in parameter maps compared to DESIGNER (Dv2)'s noise removal method. Moreover, DESIGNER (Dv2)'s updated noise and Gibbs removal methods were assessed using ground truth dMRI phantom to evaluate accuracy. Results show age correlation in white matter with DTI and DKI metrics were affected by the preprocessing pipeline, causing systematic differences in absolute parameter values and loss or gain of statistical significance. Both in clinical dMRI and ground truth phantoms, DESIGNER (Dv2) pipeline resulted in the smallest number of outlier voxels and improved accuracy in DTI and DKI metrics as noise was reduced and Gibbs removal was improved. Thus, DESIGNER (Dv2) provides more accurate and robust DTI and DKI parameter maps as compared to no preprocessing or minimal preprocessing.</description>

      <title>Modeling non-genetic information dynamics in cells using reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually all cells use energy and ion-specific membrane pumps to maintain large transmembrane gradients of Na$^+$, K$^+$, Cl$^-$, Mg$^{++}$, and Ca$^{++}$. Although they consume up to 1/3 of a cell's energy budget, the corresponding evolutionary benefit of transmembrane ion gradients remain unclear. Here, we propose that ion gradients enable a dynamic and versatile biological system that acquires, analyzes, and responds to environmental information. We hypothesize environmental signals are transmitted into the cell by ion fluxes along pre-existing gradients through gated ion-specific membrane channels. The consequent changes of cytoplasmic ion concentration can generate a local response and orchestrate global or regional responses through wire-like ion fluxes along pre-existing and self-assembling cytoskeleton to engage the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nucleus.
  Here, we frame our hypothesis through a quasi-physical (Cell-Reservoir) model that treats intra-cellular ion-based information dynamics as a sub-cellular process permitting spatiotemporally resolved cellular response that is also capable of learning complex nonlinear dynamical cellular behavior. We demonstrate the proposed ion dynamics permits rapid dissemination of response to information extrinsic perturbations that is consistent with experimental observations.</description>
