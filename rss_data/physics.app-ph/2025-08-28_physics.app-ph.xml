      <title>Arbitrary mechanical memory encoding via nonlinear waves in bistable metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials composed of bistable elements have recently emerged as promising platforms for mechanical memory. Traditional approaches to writing information in these systems typically rely on localized actuation or predefined coupling schemes, which are often labor-intensive or lack adaptability. In this work, we introduce a one-dimensional metamaterial consisting of mass-in-mass bistable units that are statically decoupled yet dynamically switchable, allowing arbitrary mechanical information to be encoded through nonlinear waves applied at the boundary of the system. Through a combination of experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that tailored input signals can selectively trigger state transitions deep within the structure, enabling remote and programmable bit writing. This approach opens a new avenue for mechanical memory, harnessing the robustness of bistable elements and the tunability of nonlinear wave-driven actuation.</description>

      <title>Revealing degradation mechanisms in YSZ ceramics through machine learning-guided aging and multiscale characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-term performance of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based energy and biomedical devices is compromised by low-temperature degradation (LTD). This study presents a novel integration of machine learning-guided hydrothermal aging with multiscale characterization to resolve a two-stage degradation mechanism in 3 mol% YSZ. Stage 1 (0 to 30 hrs) features initial surface relief building, which transitions to partial refinement and relief distribution in stage 2 (30 to 60 hrs), alongside a rise in monoclinic phase content. The evolving microstructure increases triple-junction grain boundary density, and these junctions act as degradation hotspots, where vacancy exchange and water access accelerate the transformation. These findings highlight grain boundary chemistry, rather than grain size alone, as a key LTD driver, suggesting boundary engineering as a strategy to enhance YSZ stability for energy, biomedical, and thermal applications.</description>

      <title>Isotope Enrichment and Element Separation by Self Generated Magnetic Centrifuge Fields in Ultrafast Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent clustering analysis for homogenisation of heterogeneous plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Photonic restricted Boltzmann machine for content generation tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling, enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations. The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Stacked Time-Varying Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces offer unique opportunities for wave manipulation, however, their practical realization is often constrained by the requirement for in-plane spatial modulation, which necessitates a large number of time-varying elements. In this work, we introduce an alternative architecture based on a cascade of spatially uniform metasurfaces subjected to periodic temporal modulation. Although all metasurfaces share the same modulation frequency, their individual modulation functions are independently engineered to achieve a desired complex electromagnetic response. We develop a general theoretical framework for the design and optimization of such stacked metasurface systems, composed of dense arrays of cylindrical meta-atoms with time-varying plasma and/or collision frequencies. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through the optimization of metasurface designs that enable magnet-free isolation at the fundamental frequency and a temporal analogue of circulators. Furthermore, we show that a metasurface stack can be implemented using only a few time-modulated elements embedded within a parallel-plate waveguide, opening new avenues for extremely compact, versatile, and scalable spatiotemporal platforms for next-generation photonic and microwave systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz control of relativistic electron beams for femtosecond bunching and laser-synchronized temporal locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond relativistic electron bunches and micro-bunch trains synchronised with femtosecond precision to external laser sources are widely sought for next-generation accelerator and photonic technologies, from extreme UV and X-ray light sources for materials science, to ultrafast electron diffraction and future high-energy physics colliders. While few-femtosecond bunches have been demonstrated, achieving the control, stability and femtosecond-level laser synchronisation remains critically out of reach. Here we demonstrate a concept for laser-driven compression of high-energy (35.5 MeV) electron bunches with temporal synchronisation to a high-power (few-TW) laser system. Laser-generated multi-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses drive periodic electron energy modulation, enabling subsequent magnetic compression capable of generating tuneable picosecond-spaced bunch trains with 30 pC total charge and 50 A peak currents, or to compress a single bunch by a factor of 27 down to 15 fs duration. The THz-driven compression simultaneously drives temporal-locking of the bunch to the THz drive laser, providing a route to femtosecond-level synchronisation, overcoming the timing jitter inherent to radio-frequency accelerators and high-power laser systems. This THz technique offers compact and flexible bunch control with unprecedented temporal synchronisation, opening a pathway to unlock new capabilities for free electron lasers, ultrafast electron diffraction and novel plasma accelerators.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Programming of Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programming photonic integrated hardware often reveals as a challenging task because of the presence of non-idealities in the photonic chip. These include fabrication imper- fections and parasitic effects such as thermal crosstalk, which cause unwanted coupling between control signals. Traditional control methods based on idealized models often fail to account for these phenomana, leading to significant discrepancies between the desired and actual circuit behaviour. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach for control- ling meshes of thermally tuneable Mach Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), which exploits a machine learning (ML) model trained to compensate for these non-idealities by pre- adjusting the electrical power given to integrated phase shifters. The proposed ML system is assessed using synthetic datasets and experimentally validated on a 3 x 3 triangular MZI mesh. Results demonstrate that the data-driven controller significantly improves program- ming accuracy, offering a robust solution for accurate programming of photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Predicting Trends in $V_{OC}$ Through Rapid, Multimodal Characterization of State-of-the-Art p-i-n Perovskite Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite photovoltaic technologies are approaching commercial deployment, yet single junction and tandem architectures both still have significant room to improve power conversion efficiency and stability. The ability to perform rapid screening of material quality after altering processing conditions is critical to accelerating the optimization and commercialization of perovskite-based technologies. Currently, researchers utilize a wide range of stand-alone metrology tools to isolate sources of power loss throughout a device stack, which can be slow and labor intensive. Here, we demonstrate the use of a multimodal metrology approach to rapidly determine the maximum achievable and predicted open circuit voltages of &gt; 100 perovskite devices during fabrication. Acquisition of these different data are facilitated by combining them into a single integrated measurement platform. We show that these data and automated analysis can be used to rapidly understand and ultimately predict quantitative trends in open circuit voltages of state-of-the-art devices architectures. The data and automated analysis workflow presented provides a reliable approach to quickly identify absorber and charge transport layer combinations that can lead to improved open circuit voltages.</description>

      <title>Finding passive, reciprocal metasurfaces for arbitrary wave transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general design method for finding the passive, reciprocal surface impedance tensor required to enact any wave transformation. We do this through characterising the surface in terms of a tensorial surface impedance, showing that a large family of impedance distributions can be found that perform an identical wave transformation. Even when the conditions of reciprocity and passivity are imposed, there still remain many solutions to the design problem.} We exploit this as a design method for metasurfaces, giving two examples where the metasurface rotates the input polarization and reshapes the output field, showing we can parameterize the set of equivalent reciprocal metasurfaces in terms of a single complex parameter. \hl{In addition, through allowing dissipation and gain within the response, the surface can have many different functionalities in the orthogonal polarization, opening up a new route for the design of multiplexed metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale 3D structural dynamics and functional degradation of Pt alloy nanocatalysts during the oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pt-based electrocatalysts are the primary choice for fuel cells due to their superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. To enhance ORR performance and durability, extensive studies have investigated transition metal alloying, doping, and shape control to optimize the three key governing factors for ORR: geometry, local chemistry, and strain of their surface and subsurface. However, systematic optimization remains incomplete, as it requires an atomic-scale understanding of these factors and their dynamics over potential cycling, as well as their relationship to ORR activity. Here, we implement neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography to measure the 3D atomic structural dynamics and their effects on the functional degradation of PtNi alloy catalysts. Our results reveal that PtNi catalysts undergo shape changes, surface alloying, and strain relaxation during cycling, which can be effectively mitigated by Ga doping. By combining geometry, local chemistry, and strain analysis, we calculated the changes in ORR activity over thousands of cycles and observed that Ga doping leads to higher initial activity and greater stability. These findings offer a pathway to understanding 3D atomic structural dynamics and their relation to ORR activity during cycling, paving the way for the systematic design of durable, high-efficiency nanocatalysts.</description>
