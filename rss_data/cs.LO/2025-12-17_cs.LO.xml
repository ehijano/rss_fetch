      <title>TAPAAL HyperLTL: A Tool for Checking Hyperproperties of Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Petri nets are a modeling formalism capable of describing complex distributed systems and there exists a large number of both academic and industrial tools that enable automatic verification of model properties. Typical questions include reachability analysis and model checking against logics like LTL and CTL. However, these logics fall short when describing properties like non-interference and observational determinism that require simultaneous reasoning about multiple traces of the model and can thus only be expressed as hyperproperties. We introduce, to the best of our knowledge, the first HyperLTL model checker for Petri nets. The tool is fully integrated into the verification framework TAPAAL and we describe the semantics of the hyperlogic, present the tool's architecture and GUI, and evaluate the performance of the HyperLTL verification engine on two benchmarks of problems originating from the computer networking domain.</description>

      <title>Relevant HAL Interface Requirements for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedded applications often use a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to access hardware. Improper use of the HAL can lead to incorrect hardware operations, resulting in system failure and potentially serious damage to the hardware. The question is how one can obtain prioritize, among a possibly large set of HAL interface requirements, those that are indisputably relevant for preventing this kind of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of relevance. This allows us to leverage a formal method, i.e., software model checking, to produce a mathematical proof that a requirement is indisputably relevant. We propose an approach to extract provably relevant requirements from issue reports on system failures. We present a case study to demonstrate that the approach is feasible in principle. The case study uses three examples of issue reports on embedded applications that use the SPI bus via the spidev HAL. The overall contribution of this paper is to pave the way for the study of approaches to a new kind of prioritization aimed at preventing a specific kind of system failure.</description>

      <title>Belief in Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a novel semantics for belief using simplicial complexes. In our framework, belief satisfies the \textsf{KD45} axioms and rules as well as the ``knowledge implies belief'' axiom ($K\phi \lthen B\phi$); in addition, we adopt the (standard) assumption that each facet in our simplicial models has exactly one vertex of every color. No existing model of belief in simplicial complexes that we are aware of is able to satisfy all of these conditions without trivializing belief to coincide with knowledge. We also address the common technical assumption of ``properness'' for relational structures made in the simplicial semantics literature, namely, that no two worlds fall into the same knowledge cell for all agents; we argue that there are conceptually sensible belief frames in which this assumption is violated, and use the result of ``A Note on Proper Relational Structures'' to bypass this restriction. We conclude with a discussion of how an alternative ``simplicial sets'' framework could allow us to bypass properness altogether and perhaps provide a more streamlined simplicial framework for representing belief.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Logic-Based Alternative to Reward Models in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.
  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.
  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChunjinJiang/sgrpo.</description>

      <title>On Improving Deep Active Learning with Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) aims to reduce labeling costs in neural-network training by prioritizing the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation. Beyond selecting which samples to label, several DAL approaches further enhance data efficiency by augmenting the training set with synthetic inputs that do not require additional manual labeling. In this work, we investigate how augmenting the training data with adversarial inputs that violate robustness constraints can improve DAL performance. We show that adversarial examples generated via formal verification contribute substantially more than those produced by standard, gradient-based attacks. We apply this extension to multiple modern DAL techniques, as well as to a new technique that we propose, and show that it yields significant improvements in model generalization across standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <title>Strong normalization through idempotent intersection types: a new syntactical approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09831v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that intersection type assignment systems can be used to characterize strong normalization (SN). Typical proofs that typable lambda-terms are SN in these systems rely on semantical techniques. In this work, we study $\Lambda_\cap^e$, a variant of Coppo and Dezani's (Curry-style) intersection type system, and we propose a syntactical proof of strong normalization for it. We first design $\Lambda_\cap^i$, a Church-style version, in which terms closely correspond to typing derivations. Then we prove that typability in $\Lambda_\cap^i$ implies SN through a measure that, given a term, produces a natural number that decreases along with reduction. Finally, the result is extended to $\Lambda_\cap^e$, since the two systems simulate each other.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>

      <title>Cyclic Proofs in Hoare Logic and its Reverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the relationships between axiomatic and cyclic proof systems for the partial and total versions of Hoare logic and those of its dual, known as reverse Hoare logic (or sometimes incorrectness logic). In the axiomatic proof systems for these logics, the proof rules for looping constructs involve an explicit loop invariant, which in the case of the total versions additionally require a well-founded termination measure. In the cyclic systems, these are replaced by rules that simply unroll the loops, together with a principle allowing the formation of cycles in the proof, subject to a global soundness condition that ensures the well-foundedness of the circular reasoning. Interestingly, the cyclic soundness conditions for partial Hoare logic and its reverse are similar and essentially coinductive in character, while those for the total versions are also similar and essentially inductive. We show that these cyclic systems are sound, by direct argument, and relatively complete, by translation from axiomatic to cyclic proofs.</description>

      <title>An Expressive Coalgebraic Modal Logic for Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular automata provide models of parallel computation based on cells, whose connectivity is given by an action of a monoid on the cells. At each step in the computation, every cell is decorated with a state that evolves in discrete steps according to a local update rule, which determines the next state of a cell based on its neighbour's states. In this paper, we consider a coalgebraic view on cellular automata, which does not require typical restrictions, such as uniform neighbourhood connectivity and uniform local rules. Using the coalgebraic view, we devise a behavioural equivalence for cellular automata and a modal logic to reason about their behaviour. We then prove a Hennessy-Milner style theorem, which states that pairs of cells satisfy the same modal formulas exactly if they are identified under cellular behavioural equivalence.</description>

      <title>Kimina Lean Server: A High-Performance Lean Server for Large-Scale Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Kimina Lean Server, an open-source project designed as a high-performance verifier for reinforcement learning pipelines. Built on top of the Lean REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) maintained by the Lean FRO, our server combines server-side parallelism by managing multiple Lean processes in parallel with a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism that reuses Lean imports across requests. On the client side, a lightweight Python package enables submitting proof batches and receiving Lean feedback, including extracted tactics and tactic states.
  Together, these features enable a scalable workflow for large-scale verification and data extraction. In our experiments, the Kimina Lean Server outperforms previous Lean interaction tools, achieving a 1.5 to 2 times speedup in verification time. Moreover, its improved efficiency has enabled its use in the large-scale training of state-of-the-art models such as Kimina-Prover.
  We hope that our open-source project will support the neural theorem proving community and accelerate future progress by enabling efficient large-scale verification and proof data extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01626v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic separation logic offers an approach to reasoning about imperative probabilistic programs in which a separating conjunction is used as a mechanism for expressing independence properties. Crucial to the effectiveness of the formalism is the frame rule, which enables modular reasoning about independent probabilistic state. We explore a semantic formulation of probabilistic separation logic, in which the frame rule has the same simple formulation as in separation logic, without further side conditions. This is achieved by building a notion of safety into specifications, using which we establish a crucial property of specifications, called relative tightness, from which the soundness of the frame rule follows.</description>

Abstract: Partial Markov categories are a recent framework for categorical probability theory that provide an abstract account of partial probabilistic computation with updating semantics. In this article, we discuss two order relations on the morphisms of a partial Markov category. In particular, we prove that every partial Markov category is canonically preorder-enriched, recovering several well-known order enrichments. We also demonstrate that the existence of codiagonal maps (comparators) is closely related to order properties of partial Markov categories. Finally, we introduce a synthetic version of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality and, from it, we prove that updating increases validity.</description>

      <title>Initial Algebras of Domains via Quotient Inductive-Inductive Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain theory has been developed as a mathematical theory of computation and to give a denotational semantics to programming languages. It helps us to fix the meaning of language concepts, to understand how programs behave and to reason about programs. At the same time it serves as a great theory to model various algebraic effects such as non-determinism, partial functions, side effects and numerous other forms of computation.
  In the present paper, we present a general framework to construct algebraic effects in domain theory, where our domains are DCPOs: directed complete partial orders. We first describe so called DCPO algebras for a signature, where the signature specifies the operations on the DCPO and the inequational theory they obey. This provides a method to represent various algebraic effects, like partiality. We then show that initial DCPO algebras exist by defining them as so called Quotient Inductive-Inductive Types (QIITs), known from homotopy type theory. A quotient inductive-inductive type allows one to simultaneously define an inductive type and an inductive relation on that type, together with equations on the type. We illustrate our approach by showing that several well-known constructions of DCPOs fit our framework: coalesced sums, smash products and free DCPOs (partiality and power domains). Our work makes use of various features of homotopy type theory and is formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Continuation Semantics for Fixpoint Modal Logic and Computation Tree Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce continuation semantics for both fixpoint modal logic (FML) and Computation Tree Logic* (CTL*), parameterised by a choice of branching type and quantitative predicate lifting. Our main contribution is proving that they are equivalent to coalgebraic semantics, for all branching types. Our continuation semantics is defined over coalgebras of the continuation monad whose answer type coincides with the domain of truth values of the formulas. By identifying predicates and continuations, such a coalgebra has a canonical interpretation of the modality by evaluation of continuations. We show that this continuation semantics is equivalent to the coalgebraic semantics for fixpoint modal logic. We then reformulate the current construction for coalgebraic models of CTL*. These models are usually required to have an infinitary trace/maximal execution map, characterized as the greatest fixpoint of a special operator. Instead, we allow coalgebraic models of CTL* to employ non-maximal fixpoints, which we call execution maps. Under this reformulation, we establish a general result on transferring execution maps via monad morphisms. From this result, we obtain that continuation semantics is equivalent to the coalgebraic semantics for CTL*. We also identify a sufficient condition under which CTL can be encoded into fixpoint modal logic under continuation semantics.</description>

Abstract: Causality serves as an abstract notion of time for concurrent systems. A computation is causal, or simply valid, if each observation of a computation event is preceded by the observation of its causes. The present work establishes that this simple requirement is equally relevant when the occurrence of an event is invertible. We propose a conservative extension of causal models for concurrency that accommodates reversible computations. We first model reversible computations using a symmetric residuation operation in the general model of configuration structures. We show that stable configuration structures, which correspond to prime algebraic domains, remain stable under the action of this residuation. We then derive a semantics of reversible computations for prime event structures, which is shown to coincide with a switch operation that dualizes conflict and causality.</description>

      <title>Strong Dinatural Transformations and Generalised Codensity Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce dicodensity monads: a generalisation of pointwise codensity monads generated by functors to monads generated by mixed-variant bifunctors. Our construction is based on the notion of strong dinaturality (also known as Barr dinaturality), and is inspired by denotational models of certain types in polymorphic lambda calculi - in particular, a form of continuation monads with universally quantified variables, such as the Church encoding of the list monad in System F. Extending some previous results on Cayley-style representations, we provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish an isomorphism between a monad and the dicodensity monad for a given bifunctor. Then, we focus on the class of monads obtained by instantiating our construction with hom-functors and, more generally, bifunctors given by objects of homomorphisms (that is, internalised hom-sets between Eilenberg--Moore algebras). This gives us, for example, novel presentations of monads generated by different kinds of semirings and other theories used to model ordered nondeterministic computations.</description>

      <title>Traces via Strategies in Two-Player Games</title>

Abstract: Traces form a coarse notion of semantic equivalence between states of a process, and have been studied coalgebraically for various types of system. We instantiate the finitary coalgebraic trace semantics framework of Hasuo et al. for controller-versus-environment games, encompassing both nondeterministic and probabilistic environments. Although our choice of monads is guided by the constraints of this abstract framework, they enable us to recover familiar game-theoretic concepts. Concretely, we show that in these games, each element in the trace map corresponds to a collection (a subset or distribution) of plays the controller can force. Furthermore, each element can be seen as the outcome of following a controller strategy. Our results are parametrised by a weak distributive law, which computes what the controller can force in a single step.</description>

      <title>Compact Quantitative Theories of Convex Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of compact quantitative equational theory. A quantitative equational theory is defined to be compact if all its consequences are derivable by means of finite proofs. We prove that the theory of interpolative barycentric (also known as convex) quantitative algebras of Mardare et. al. is compact. This serves as a paradigmatic example, used to obtain other compact quantitative equational theories of convex algebras, each axiomatizing some distance on finitely supported probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Compositional Inference for Bayesian Networks and Causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference is a fundamental reasoning technique in probability theory. When applied to a large joint distribution, it involves updating with evidence (conditioning) in one or more components (variables) and computing the outcome in other components. When the joint distribution is represented by a Bayesian network, the network structure may be exploited to proceed in a compositional manner -- with great benefits. However, the main challenge is that updating involves (re)normalisation, making it an operation that interacts badly with other operations.
  String diagrams are becoming popular as a graphical technique for probabilistic (and quantum) reasoning. Conditioning has appeared in string diagrams, in terms of a disintegration, using bent wires and shaded (or dashed) normalisation boxes. It has become clear that such normalisation boxes do satisfy certain compositional rules. This paper takes a decisive step in this development by adding a removal rule to the formalism, for the deletion of shaded boxes. Via this removal rule one can get rid of shaded boxes and terminate an inference argument. This paper illustrates via many (graphical) examples how the resulting compositional inference technique can be used for Bayesian networks, causal reasoning and counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Enriched Data Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, categories of algebras of endofunctors were shown to be enriched in categories of coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and the extra structure of that enrichment was used to define a generalization of inductive data types. These generalized inductive data types are parametrized by a coalgebra $C$, so we call them $C$-inductive data types; we call the morphisms induced by their universal property $C$-inductive functions. We extend that work by incorporating natural transformations into the theory: given a suitable natural transformation between endofunctors, we show that this induces enriched functors between their categories of algebras which preserve $C$-inductive data types and $C$-inductive functions. Such $C$-inductive data types are often finite versions of the corresponding inductive data type, and we show how our framework can extend classical initial algebra semantics to these types. For instance, we show that our theory naturally produces partially inductive functions on lists, changes in list element types, and tree pruning functions.</description>

      <title>The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control</title>

Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the (simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential, branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.</description>

      <title>The Equational Theories Project: Advancing Collaborative Mathematical Research at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the Equational Theories Project (ETP), an online collaborative pilot project to explore new ways to collaborate in mathematics with machine assistance. The project successfully determined all 22 028 942 edges of the implication graph between the 4694 simplest equational laws on magmas, by a combination of human-generated and automated proofs, all validated by the formal proof assistant language Lean. As a result of this project, several new constructions of magmas satisfying specific laws were discovered, and several auxiliary questions were also addressed, such as the effect of restricting attention to finite magmas.</description>
