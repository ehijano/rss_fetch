      <title>Further Remarks on the Entanglement Entropy of Hopf links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connected sum of Hopf links in $S^3$. Particularly, we compute the entanglement entropy (EE) as a function of the number of link components. We find evidence of lower and upper bounds for the entanglement entropy. We show that the $SU(2)$ theory exhibits sensitivity to the parity of links. We also find evidence suggesting the existence of a well-defined limit of the large number of link components.</description>

      <title>Spacetime dilaton in ${\rm AdS}_3\times X$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum generating operators (DDF operators) for bosonic strings and superstrings in ${\rm AdS}_3\times X$ with pure, $\textit{generic}$ NSNS flux. The dual CFT is conjectured to be a deformed symmetric orbifold of $\mathbb{R}_{\widetilde{Q}}\times X$, where $\mathbb{R}_{\widetilde{Q}}$ denotes a linear dilaton theory with slope $\widetilde{Q}$. In this paper, we construct DDF operators corresponding to the spacetime linear dilaton field in the limit where the worldsheet theory becomes free. The DDF operator gives another evidence supporting the proposed dual CFT. Furthermore, the DDF operator is constructed purely from the $\rm AdS_3$ fields and thus, strongly implies the existence of $\mathbb{R}_{\widetilde{Q}}$ for generic $X$ that defines a consistent background.</description>

      <title>Partial entanglement entropy threads in island phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13535v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of AdS/CFT, it was recently proposed that the boundary partial entanglement entropy structure can be represented by the so-called partial entanglement entropy (PEE) threads in the AdS bulk, which are bulk geodesics with the density determined by the boundary PEE structure \cite{Lin:2023rbd,Lin:2024dho}. In Poincar\'e AdS space, it was shown that the PEE threads cover the AdS space uniformly, such that the number of intersections between any bulk surface and the bulk PEE threads is always given by the area of the surface divided by 4G.
  In this paper, we investigate the configurations of PEE threads when the boundary state is in island phase. The island phase was studied in the context of the holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$, which has been shown to capture all the main features of AdS/BCFT. Compared with AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, in island phase instead of modifying the distribution of the bulk PEE threads, we should replace the boundary points with the corresponding cutoff spheres. Then the two-point and four-point functions of twist operators can be reproduced by identifying the bulk homologous surfaces anchored on the corresponding cutoff spheres that has the minimal number of intersections with the bulk PEE threads. This gives us a better understanding about the PEE structure in island phase and reproduces the island formula for entanglement entropy by allowing homologous surfaces to anchor on any cutoff surfaces. Furthermore, it gives a demonstration for the two basic proposals and a better understanding for the entanglement contribution that makes the foundation to compute the balanced partial entanglement entropy (BPE) \cite{Basu:2023wmv} which reproduces the entanglement wedge cross-section in island phase.</description>

      <title>Fragmented perspective of self-organized criticality and disorder in log gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a statistical model to discuss nonequilibrium fragmentation phenomena taking place in the stochastic dynamics of the log sector in log gravity. From the canonical Gibbs model, a combinatorial analysis reveals an important aspect of the $n$-particle evolution previously shown to generate a collection of random partitions according to the Ewens distribution realized in a disconnected double Hurwitz number in genus zero. By treating each possible partition as a member of an ensemble of fragmentations, and ensemble averaging over all partitions with the Hurwitz number as a special case of the Gibbs distribution, a resulting distribution of cluster sizes appears to fall as a power of the size of the cluster. Dynamical systems that exhibit a distribution of sizes giving rise to a scale-invariant power-law behavior at a critical point possess an important property called self-organized criticality. As a corollary, the log sector of log gravity is a self-organized critical system at the critical point $\mu l =1$. A similarity between self-organized critical systems, spin glass models and the dynamics of the log sector which exhibits aging behavior reminiscent of glassy systems is pointed out by means of the P\`{o}lya distribution, also known to classify various models of (randomly fragmented) disordered systems, and by presenting the cluster distribution in the log sector of log gravity as a distinguished member of this probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Decay of Three Dimensional Holographic Quantum Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum turbulence is a far-from-equilibrium process characterized by high nonlinearity. Holographic duality provides a systematic framework for simulating the decaying $(3+1)$-dimensional quantum turbulence by numerically solving the dual Abelian-Higgs theory in a $(4+1)$-dimensional black hole background. We reveal that different types of total vortex line length $L$ decay behaviors emerge depending on the initial vortex line density, ranging from $L\sim t^{-1.5}$ to $L\sim t^{-1}$, similar to the experimental observation of $^3$He in Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 035301 (2006). Additionally, by measuring the energy flux at the black hole horizon, we determine that the energy dissipation rate $dE/dt$ is proportional to the square of the total vortex line length, consistent with the vortex line decay equation proposed by W. F. Vinen and also the experimental measurement in Nature Physics 7, 473-476 (2011). We also observe two other characteristics of quantum turbulence: 1) The Kolmogorov $-5/3$ scaling spectrum appears in regions where the total vortex line length decay law is clear and the vortex line density is sufficiently high, while it is less evident in diluted cases; 2) Unlike classical turbulence, the universal power law of superfluid velocity distribution at large speed persists throughout the entire decay process in both types of decay.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from High Temperature Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite temperature effects in string cosmology and their potential gravitational wave signature. Expanding on our recent work arXiv:2310.11494 , we consider a general configuration of highly excited open and closed strings at high enough temperature to be in the Hagedorn phase in 3+1 dimensions, in order to explore its cosmological implications. We find conditions, which can be satisfied in compactifications with moduli stabilization, that allow the long strings to remain in equilibrium in a controlled effective field theory, with equilibration driven by the joining and splitting of the dominant open string population. We calculate the emission rate of gravitons by long open strings, which we show is determined by ten dimensional flat space transition amplitudes available in the literature, and then find the total gravitational wave spectrum generated by the gas of long strings. The gravitational wave spectrum has robust characteristics. It peaks at frequencies of order 50-100 GHz, the same as for gravitational waves from the reheating epoch of the Standard Model. But the amplitude of the string signal is significantly larger than predicted by the Standard Model and its field theoretic extensions. The amplitude and other physical observables (such as the contribution to $\Delta N_{\text eff}$) are directly proportional to the string scale $M_s$; indicating that a potential signal may also determine the string scale. Our calculations provide one of the few examples of a signal of stringy origin that dominates over the field theory predictions. We give a physical explanation of our results and discuss further implications.</description>

      <title>On the conformal limit of a QED-inspired model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conformal invariant QED-inspired model is solved for a general covariant linear gauge using the Dyson-Schwinger equations for the propagators assuming a pure vector like interaction. The leading corrections to the asymptotic solutions and the exponents, that characterize the corrections to each of the two fermion propagator functions, are computed as a function of the coupling and gauge fixing parameter $\xi$. For the scalar component of the fermion propagator our findings generalizes for linear covariant gauges previous results found in the literature and reproduce the outcome of the perturbative analysis of quenched QED in the Landau gauge. Our solution for the exponent associated with vector component of the fermion propagator is new and, in the weak coupling regime, agrees with the estimation based on the perturbative analysis of quenched QED. Of the two critical exponents describing the conformal limit of the vector interaction, one of them is, in QED, associated with the regime where chiral symmetry is broken dynamically, which demands one mass scale, namely the Miransky scaling. A second mass scale has to be introduced at larger coupling constants and is associated with a change on the nature of the fermion wave function. This provides one example, that it is possible to find two interwoven cycles in Quantum Field Theory, albeit in a truncated framework, as it is known in the quantum few-body problem in the limit of a zero-range interaction.</description>

      <title>Towards All Categorical Symmetries in 2+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the most general gauging operations in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories with finite symmetry groups, which correspond to gapped boundary conditions in 3+1 dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. The classification is achieved by enumerating 2+1 dimensional oriented topological quantum field theories that cancel the 't Hooft anomaly associated with the symmetry. This framework is rigorously formulated using twisted crossed extensions of modular fusion categories and projective 3-representations. Additionally, we explore the resulting fusion 2-category symmetries and argue that this framework captures all possible categorical symmetries in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible flavor symmetries in magnetized extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss non-invertible symmetries in toroidal compactifications of higher dimensional Yang-Mills theory with magnetic fluxes, which can be regarded as an effective action of type IIB string theory with magnetized D-branes. Specifically, we derive fusion rules of discrete isometry operators, which are invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold twist. It turns out that degenerate chiral zero-modes non-trivially transform under the non-invertible symmetries in the context of quantum mechanics. Hence, non-invertible symmetries correspond to flavor symmetries of chiral zero modes and determine their flavor structure. We explicitly show the representations and selection rules of chiral zero modes on their wave functions. These zero modes may correspond to generations of quarks and leptons in four-dimensional low-energy effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Renyi reflected entropy and entanglement wedge cross section with cosmic branes in AdS/BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the $m-1$ correction to the reflected entropy for two adjacent intervals on a half-infinite line within the AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ framework, where $m$ is a Renyi index for a canonical purification. We utilize the doubling trick and compute the leading terms in the large central charge expansion of correlation functions in the holographic BCFT. In the corresponding AdS space with an end of the world brane, we analyze the entanglement wedge cross section, the dual counterpart of reflected entropy. This AdS/BCFT setup allows us to explore a richer set of phases in the entanglement wedge cross section. The $m-1$ correction in the holographic BCFT manifests as modifications in the entanglement wedge cross section induced by cosmic branes. For the adjacent intervals anchored to the boundary of BCFT, we show the duality between the entanglement wedge cross section with the backreaction from a cosmic brane and Renyi reflected entropy at all orders in $m-1$. Furthermore, by analyzing the entanglement wedge cross section for general adjacent intervals, we provide guidance for an $\epsilon$-expansion of five-point functions in the holographic CFT, where $\epsilon$ is the rescaled conformal dimension by the central charge.</description>

      <title>Chaos Bound and its violation in Black p-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have extensively investigated the dynamics of circular geodesic (chargeless massive particle) followed by the investigation of the pulsating classical string in the p-brane background. This work is a continuation of the previous work (arXiv:2307.12350v3), where we have identified the presence of chaos numerically for the classical string hovering near the generic p-brane(p&lt;7). Here, for the particle probe, we have found the presence of chaos in the vicinity of the horizon. Further, we have observed a violation of the well-known MSS bound in specific extremal p-branes, however, no violation is observed in the non-extremal cases. Similar observations have been found in the case of the classical string, where the violation of the bound is significant near the horizon. Thus, our semi-analytical arguments show that the chaotic dynamics in the black p-brane exhibit the (generalised) universal bound with some notable violations independent of whether we take particle or classical string as a probe.</description>

      <title>Measuring Chern-Simons level $k$ by braiding $SU(2)_k$ anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory in application to the quantum computing is actively developing at the present. However, most discussed are the questions of using materials with known parameters and building corresponding quantum gates and algorithms. In this paper we discuss opposite problem of finding Chern-Simons level $k$ in the unknown material. For this purpose, we use the previously derived braiding rules for Chern-Simons $SU(2)_k$ anyons. Using certain operations (turnarounds) on three anyons, one can measure probabilities of annihilation of pairs of anyons, which depend on the parameter of the theory. Therefore, Chern-Simons level $k$ can be found from such an experiment. It is implied that anyons additionally possess certain properties which are required for topological quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ Yang-Mills theory is three-dimensional gravity with background sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory with certain gauge groups is known to be equivalent to a first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, where both are purely topological. Here, we extend this correspondence to theories with dynamical degrees of freedom. We show that three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ is equivalent to the first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with no cosmological constant coupled to a background stress-energy tensor density (which breaks the diffeomorphism symmetry). The local degree of freedom of three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory corresponds to degenerate "gravitational waves" in which the metric is degenerate and the spin connection is no longer completely determined by the metric. Turning on a cosmological constant produces the third-way (for $\Lambda&lt;0$) or the imaginary third-way (for $\Lambda&gt;0$) gauge theories with a background stress-energy tensor density.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic Hopf Algebra of Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of regions is an approach for developing asymptotic expansions of Feynman Integrals. We focus on expansions in Euclidean signature, where the method of regions can also be formulated as an expansion by subgraph. We show that for such expansions valid around small/large masses and momenta the graph combinatorial operations can be formulated in terms of what we call the asymptotic Hopf algebra. This Hopf algebra is closely related to the motic Hopf algebra underlying the $R^*$ operation, an extension of Bogoliubov's $R$ operation, to subtract both IR and UV divergences of Feynman integrals in the Euclidean. We focus mostly on the leading power, for which the Hopf algebra formulation is simpler. We uncover a close connection between Bogoliubov's $R$ operation in the Connes-Kreimer formulation and the remainder $\mathcal{R}$ of the series expansion, whose Hopf algebraic structure is identically formalised in the corresponding group of characters. While in the Connes-Kreimer formulation the UV counterterm is formalised in terms of a twisted antipode, we show that in the expansion by subgraph a similar role is played by the integrand Taylor operator. To discuss the structure of higher power expansions we introduce a novel Hopf monoid formulation.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial chiral algebras of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits. A companion paper will discuss additional details and relations to previously studied self-dual black holes.</description>

      <title>Fusion 3-Categories for Duality Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fusion 3-categorical symmetries for quantum theories in (3+1)d with self-duality defects. Such defects have been realized physically by half-space gauging in theories with 1-form symmetries $A[1]$ for an abelian group $A$, and have found applications in the continuum and the lattice. These fusion 3-categories will be called (generalized) Tambara-Yamagami fusion 3-categories $(\mathbf{3TY})$. We consider the Brauer-Picard and Picard 4-groupoids to construct these categories using a 3-categorical version of the extension theory introduced by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. These two 4-groupoids correspond to the construction of duality defects either directly in 4d, or from the 5d Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). The Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion 1-categories naturally appears in the aforementioned 4-groupoids and represents enrichments of standard duality defects by (2+1)d TFTs. Our main objective is to study graded extensions of the fusion 3-category $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$. Firstly, we use invertible bimodule 3-categories and the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid. Secondly, we use that the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$ can be identified with the Picard 4-groupoid of its Drinfeld center. Moreover, the Drinfeld center of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$, which represents topological defects of the SymTFT, is completely described by a sylleptic strongly fusion 2-category formed by topological surface defects of the SymTFT. These are classified by a finite abelian group equipped with an alternating 2-form. We relate the Picard 4-groupoid of the corresponding braided fusion 3-categories with a generalized Witt group constructed from certain graded braided fusion 1-categories using a twisted Deligne tensor product. We perform explicit computations for $\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $\mathbb{Z}/4$ graded $\mathbf{3TY}$ categories.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theory Action for the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a field-theory framework in which fields transform under the little group, rather than the Lorentz group, specific to each particle type. By utilizing these fields, along with spinor products and the x factor, we construct a field-theory action that naturally reproduces the vertices of the Constructive Standard Model (CSM). This approach eliminates unphysical components, significantly reduces the degrees of freedom compared to traditional field theory, and offers deeper insights into the power of constructive amplitudes. Our action is momentum-conserving, Lorentz-invariant, Hermitian, and non-local. We also discuss this as a framework for developing new constructive field theories, discussing their essential properties and potential applicability in renormalization theory and non-perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Ultraheavy Dark Matter and WIMPs Production aided by Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary bound restricts thermal relics to be lighter than $100$ TeV. This work investigates the production of ultraheavy dark matter and WIMPs in the presence of primordial black holes. Firstly, we describe how Hawking evaporation can produce ultraheavy dark matter with masses above $10^{12}$ GeV in radiation and matter-domination eras. Later, we assess how primordial black holes that induce a non-standard cosmology impact the predicted relic density of a thermal relic and explore the interplay between them, considering the restrictions arising from entropy injection due to the evaporation of primordial black holes. Considering a concrete B-L model, where the dark matter is a Dirac particle, we obtain the correct relic density for various freeze-out scenarios and show that a dark matter particle can nicely reproduce the correct relic density in agreement with current limits with masses above the $10$ TeV scale. Hence, this work strengthens the continuous search for heavy dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>Mysterious Triality and the Exceptional Symmetry of Loop Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we introduced Mysterious Triality, extending the Mysterious Duality of Iqbal, Neitzke, and Vafa between physics and algebraic geometry to include algebraic topology in the form of rational homotopy theory. Starting with the rational Sullivan minimal model of the 4-sphere $S^4$, capturing the dynamics of M-theory via Hypothesis H, this progresses to the dimensional reduction of M-theory on torus $T^k$, $k \ge 1$, with its dynamics described via the iterated cyclic loop space $\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$ of the 4-sphere. From this, we also extracted data corresponding to the maximal torus/Cartan subalgebra and the Weyl group of the exceptional Lie group/algebra of type $E_k$.
  In this paper, we discover much richer symmetry by extending the data of the Cartan subalgebra to a maximal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}_k^{k(k)}$ of the split real form $\mathfrak{e}_{k(k)}$ of the exceptional Lie algebra of type $E_k$ by exhibiting an action, in rational homotopy category, of $\mathfrak{p}_k^{k(k)}$ on the slightly more symmetric than $\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$ toroidification $\mathcal{T}^k S^4$. This action universally represents symmetries of the equations of motion of supergravity in the reduction of M-theory to $11-k$ dimensions.
  Along the way, we identify the minimal model of the toroidification $\mathcal{T}^k S^4$, generalizing the results of Vigu\'{e}-Poirrier, Sullivan, and Burghelea, and establish an algebraic toroidification/totalization adjunction.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Gravitational Wave Equations in Spherical Symmetry from Curvature Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole perturbation theory on spherically symmetric backgrounds has been instrumental in establishing various aspects about the gravitational dynamics close to black holes, and continues to be an interesting avenue to confront current challenges in gravitational physics. In this paper, we present an approach to perturbation theory in spherical symmetry that addresses simultaneously some conceivably inconvenient aspects of the traditional methods. In particular, focusing on Schwarzschild's background we are able to derive a decoupled wave equation, for a single complex variable, by simply computing one component of the curvature wave equation satisfied by a complex self-dual version of the Riemann tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the variable consist only of even and odd pieces of the metric fluctuation, respectively, and both satisfy the Regge-Wheeler equation. Besides providing a systematic derivation of decoupled equations, an immediate corollary of our results is the isospectrality between even and odd sectors. We conclude by discussing potential extensions of our formalism to include matter and higher orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the circuit complexity of a quantum charged particle in an external magnetic field. Utilizing the Nielsen approach, we determine the complexity of thermofield double states as functions of time, temperature, and cyclotron frequency. We analyze both the complexity and the amplitude of its oscillations across various parameter values, and reveal that these results cannot be derived as a limit of the harmonic oscillator case. Finally, we calculate the rate of complexity and show that it obeys the Lloyd bound.</description>

      <title>Matter really does matter, or Why $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ type theories are significant for gravitational physics and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Lacombe, Mukohyama, and Seitz, JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024)), the authors provided an in-depth analysis of a class of modified gravity theories, generally called $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, which assume the existence of a non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter. It was argued that if the matter sector consists of Standard Model particles, then these theories suffer from the presence of ghosts, or are just scalar/vector-tensor theories. Hence, the relevance of these theories for cosmology was questioned. It is the goal of the present work to carefully analyze, discuss, and assess the line of arguments proposed in Lacombe et al. JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024). After a qualitative critical discussion of the five general arguments proposed for the validity of a gravitational theory, we present the theoretical foundations of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, including their possible relations with quantum gravity, and discuss in detail the role of matter. The matter source discussed in Lacombe et al., consisting predominantly of a massless scalar field, is extremely restrictive, and rather irrelevant for cosmology and the description of the observational data. We also devote a detailed discussion of the problem of the energy scales of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories. To test the observational relevance of this type of theories we present the comparison of a simple theoretical model with a small set of observational data and with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We conclude by pointing out that the analysis of Lacombe et al., JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024), even very useful for the understanding of some limited aspects of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, and of their theoretical foundations, cannot be considered as a valid or definite criticism of these approaches to gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational origin of the Tsallis entropy, characterized by the nonadditive index $\delta$. Utilizing Wald's formalism within the framework of $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity, we evaluate the entropy on the black hole horizon for constant curvature solutions to the spherically symmetric vacuum field equations. In so doing, we demonstrate that the Tsallis entropy can be effectively derived from a generalization of the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}\propto R^{1+\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon=\delta-1$ quantifies small deviations from general relativity. In conclusion, we examine the physical implications of our findings in light of cosmological observations and elaborate on the possibility of solving the thermodynamic instability of Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism has been the major computational tool to study the superhorizon evolution of the scalar type perturbation sourced by scalar fields. Recently, this formalism was generalized to compute an arbitrary scalar, vector, and tensor type perturbations, including the gravitational waves (GWs), sourced by an arbitrary bosonic fields. In this paper, we explain how to use the generalized $\delta N$ formalism (the g$\delta N$ formalism), considering a model with U(1) gauge fields as a concrete example. Several new findings on this model and prospects on future gravitational wave experiments are also discussed, including the condition for the two linear polarizations of GWs to have different amplitudes. This paper provides a detailed explanation of our previous paper published in Physical Review Letters. We also discuss the Weinberg's adiabatic mode for an anisotropic background, showing a qualitative difference from the one for the FLRW background.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics of an entropic graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Utilization of a quantum-classical correspondence enabled discussions regarding the usage of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas and kinetic characteristics of the graviton gas during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section as 1.16% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

Abstract: Previously, it was shown that Kerr-Sen black holes can be overcharged or overspun into naked singularities neglecting backreaction effects. Here, we re-evaluate the overspinning and overcharging problems incorporating the self energy of the perturbations due to the induced increase in the angular velocity and the electrostatic potential of the event horizon described in a seminal work by Will. We show that Kerr-Sen black holes cannot be overspun or overcharged by perturbations satisfying the null energy condition in a complete second order analysis which comprises the self-energy of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar perturbations in Kerr Black Holes: near extremal analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13964v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar perturbations in Kerr black holes using the isomonodromic method. For arbitrary scalar masses $M \mu$ and black hole spins $a/M$, we numerically determine the quasinormal frequencies for various orbital $\ell$, azimuthal $m$, and overtone $n$ numbers. In particular, we derive an analytic expression for frequencies of the zero-damping modes near the extremal limit $a/M \rightarrow 1$. For $\ell=m=1$, we reveal that the fundamental mode becomes a damped mode (rather than a zero-damping mode) if the scalar field is sufficiently heavy. By exploring the parameter space, we find numerical evidence for level-crossing between the longest-living mode and the first overtone at an exceptional point $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial perturbations serve as crucial probes for studying the early universe, providing a significant window into potential new physics during cosmic evolution. Due to the potentially large amplitudes of primordial perturbations on small scales, the contributions of high-order cosmological perturbations are highly significant. We propose a vertex approach applicable to the study of induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders. Using the vertex approach and tree diagrams, we can directly derive the explicit expressions of higher-order induced gravitational waves without involving the complex and lengthy calculations of higher-order cosmological perturbations. Correlations between different tree diagrams correspond to the loop diagrams of two-point correlation functions of induced gravitational waves. Our investigation reveals that one-particle reducible diagrams impact tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves while leaving scalar induced gravitational waves unaffected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14077v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions are pivotal and subject to diverse factors. In this study, we quantitatively investigate the impact of fluid vorticity on the evolution of magnetic fields in the 20-50\% centrality class in Au+Au collisions, with collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=(7.7, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200)$ GeV. Our results indicate that fluid vorticity leads to a delay in the evolution of the magnetic field, in which this effect becomes more pronounced as the collision energy decreases. Additionally, we have calculated the mean magnetic field values on the freeze-out hypersurface for various collision energies. Our simulation results align with the values inferred from experimental data of $\bar{\Lambda}-\Lambda$, within the error margins.</description>

      <title>Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a review of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) -- more specifically, $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar and $T_{\mu\nu}$ denotes the energy-momentum tensor. The inclusion of quadratic contributions from the energy-momentum components has intriguing cosmological implications, particularly during the Universe's early epochs. These effects dominate under high-energy conditions, enabling EMSG to potentially address unresolved issues in General Relativity (GR), such as the initial singularity and aspects of big-bang nucleosynthesis in certain models. The theory's explicit non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry leads to the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, which prompts the investigation of cosmological scenarios through the framework of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems. By employing this formalism, we interpret the energy-balance equations within EMSG from a thermodynamic perspective, viewing them as descriptions of irreversible matter creation processes. Since EMSG converges to GR in a vacuum and differences emerge only in the presence of an energy-momentum distribution, these distinctions become significant in high-curvature regions. Therefore, deviations from GR are expected to be pronounced in the dense cores of compact objects. This review delves into these facets of EMSG, highlighting its potential to shed light on some of the fundamental questions in modern cosmology and gravitational theory.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Dynamics of Spinning Black Hole Binaries in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the post-Newtonian dynamics of spinning black hole (BH) binaries in Einstein-ScalarGauss-Bonnet (ESGB) gravity, a theory that modifies general relativity by introducing a massless scalar field coupled nonminimally to gravity via the Gauss-Bonnet term. By employing an effective field theory (EFT) approach, we extend the Routhian formalism to incorporate spin effects in scalar interactions. In this formalism, we derive for the first time the effective two-body potential for spinning BHs up to the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order in generic ESGB gravity theories. This potential is expressed in terms of the sensitivities of the BHs, which are then obtained through a matching procedure using analytic BH solutions derived here within a slow-rotation approximation, accurate to seventh order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and fifth order in the BH spin. We also examine the thermodynamic properties of these rotating solutions, which, as shown in previous work, yield important insights into the inspiral phase evolution in ESGB gravity.</description>

      <title>The Flea on the Elephant: tidal Love numbers in subsolar primordial black hole searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting subsolar objects in black hole binary mergers is considered a smoking gun signature of primordial black holes. Their supposedly vanishing tidal Love number is generically thought to help distinguish them from other subsolar and more deformable compact objects, such as neutron stars. We show that a large and detectable Love number of primordial black holes can be generated in the presence of even small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing their discovery. However, such small perturbations are not tightly bound and are therefore disrupted before the mergers. We show that they leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational waveform that could be observed with current and future gravitational wave detectors. Thus, they may still hint towards the primordial nature of the black holes in the merger. Finally, we demonstrate that disregarding possible environmental effects in the matched-filter search for subsolar gravitational wave events can lead to a decreased sensitivity in the detectors.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

      <title>GALPs! Composite heavy axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of Dark Matter (DM) candidates in the form of a heavy composite Axion-Like Particle (ALP) with highly suppressed electromagnetic interactions, being stable even for masses exceeding the GeV scale. We argue that such a composite ALP emerges as a bound state -- the dark glueball -- due to confinement in a pure Yang-Mills dark sector. In a minimal ultraviolet complete QCD-like model, cosmological production of dark gluons as well as photons occurs via heavy fermion annihilation which effectively reheats both the dark and visible sectors setting up their temperature scales. Furthermore, effective interactions between glueballs and photons, resembling those of standard ALPs, are radiatively generated by heavy fermion loops. Consequently, DM glueballs interacting with photons are dubbed `Glueball ALPs' (GALPs). We uncover novel phenomenology of GALPs focusing on their unique astrophysical and cosmological signatures.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Signature of Kerr-MOG Black Hole and Superspinar via Lense-Thirring Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the geometrical differences between the black hole~(BH) and naked singularity~(NS) or superspinar via Lense-Thirring~(LT) precession in spinning modified-gravity~(MOG). For BH case, we show that the LT precession frequency~($\Omega_{LT}$) along the pole is proportional to the angular-momentum~($J$) parameter or spin parameter~($a$) and is inversely proportional to the cubic value of radial distance parameter, and also governed by Eq.(1). Along the equatorial plane it is governed by Eq.(2). While for superspinar, we show that the LT precession frequency is inversely proportional to the cubic value of the spin parameter and it decreases with distance by MOG parameter as derived in Eq.(3) at the pole and in the limit $a&gt;&gt;r$ (where $\alpha$ is MOG parameter). For $\theta\neq\frac{\pi}{2}$ and in the superspinar limit, the spin frequency varies as $\Omega_{LT}\propto \frac{1}{a^3\cos^4\theta}$ and by Eq.(38)</description>

Abstract: We numerically calculate the dynamic structure factor of the simplest two dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. This provides an important benchmark for future experiments which will explore the dynamics of such models. As would be expected, the spectrum is gapped away from the critical point, and can be understood in terms of the elementary excitations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that, in any relativistic kinetic theory whose non-hydrodynamic sector has a finite gap, the Taylor series of all hydrodynamic dispersion relations has a finite radius of convergence. Furthermore, we prove that, for shear waves, such radius of convergence cannot be smaller than $1/2$ times the gap size. Finally, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapped whenever the total scattering cross-section (expressed as a function of the energy) is bounded below by a positive non-zero constant. These results, combined with well-established covariant stability criteria, allow us to derive a rigorous upper bound on the shear viscosity of relativistic dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Mixing, Proton Decay and Gravitational Waves in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an $SO(10)$ model in which a dimension five operator induces kinetic mixing at the GUT scale between the abelian subgroups $U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_R$. We discuss in this framework gauge coupling unification and proton decay, as well as the appearance of superheavy quasistable strings with $G\mu \sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-5}$, where $\mu$ denotes the dimensionless string tension parameter. We use Bayesian analysis to show that for $G\mu$ values $\sim 4 \times 10^{-7} - 10^{-5}$, the gravitational wave spectrum emitted from the quasistable strings is in good agreement with the recent pulsar timing array data. Corresponding to $G \mu$ values $\sim 10^{-8} - 2 \times 10^{-7}$, proton decay is expected to occur at a rate accessible in the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. Finally, we present the gravitational wave spectrum emitted by effectively stable strings with $G\mu\approx 10^{-8}$ that have experienced a certain amount of inflation. This can be tested with future detectors in the $\mu$Hz frequency range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We establish the procedure to derive from an action-based variational principle the classical equations of motion in Hamiltonian phase space of a particle subject to general position and velocity dependent non-holonomic equality constraints. Key to the procedure is our introduction of Flannery brackets, which generalize Poisson brackets. We conjecture on some implications, including the possibility of replacing Poisson brackets with Flannery brackets in Dirac's brackets to provide the quantization procedure for general non-holonomic equality constraint systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of integrability breaking on the relaxation dynamics of the (double) sine-Gordon model. Compared to previous studies, we apply an alternative viewpoint motivated by open-system physics by separating the phase field into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, describing a quantum pendulum (subsystem) and an interacting phononic bath (environment). To study the relaxation dynamics in the model, we perform quantum quenches using the mini-superspace-based truncated Hamiltonian approach developed recently and simulate the real-time evolution of various entanglement measures and the energy transfer between the subsystem and its environment. Our findings demonstrate that in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations, the relaxation dynamics is substantially faster, signalled by the increase of entanglement and energy transfer between the quantum pendulum and the phonon bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the extended relaxation time approximation (ERTA) along with the theory of semi-classical spin, we develop a framework of relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics such that the relaxation time can depend on the momenta and spin of the constituent spin-1/2 particles. We also consider a general definition of the fluid four-velocity allowing the theory to be valid in a general frame and matching conditions. Consequently, we construct the frame-invariant bulk, shear, particle diffusion, and spin transport coefficients, showing that the evolution of fluid remains unaffected by spin in the limit of small polarization as was the case where the relaxation time was independent of spin or momentum.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits that contain only gates respecting a symmetry. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on the set of realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. Generically, such constraints include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while in the case of Z_2, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries, 2-qubit gates are semi-universal on qubit systems, in the case of SU(d) symmetry with d\ge 3, semi-universality can be achieved only with 3-qudit gates. The failure of semi-universality implies that the distribution generated by the circuit is not even a 2-design for the Haar (uniform) distribution over the group of all unitaries respecting the symmetry. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions on the gate set, which hold, e.g., in the case of U(1) and SU(2), the distribution of unitaries generated by the random circuit becomes a t-design for t growing polynomially with the number of qudits with a degree that is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum value of the integer t, for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a t-design, and solve this equation for various examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1806.05907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $SO(4,1)$-covariant fuzzy hyperboloid $H^4_n$ as a solution of Yang-Mills matrix models, and study the resulting higher-spin gauge theory. The degrees of freedom can be identified with functions on classical $H^4$ taking values in a higher-spin algebra associated to $\mathfrak{so}(4,1)$. We develop a suitable calculus to classify the higher-spin modes, and show that the tangential modes are stable. The metric fluctuations encode one of the spin 2 modes, however they do not propagate in the classical matrix model. Gravity is argued to arise upon taking into account induced gravity terms. This formalism can be applied to the cosmological FLRW space-time solutions of [1], which arise as projections of $H^4_n$. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the tangential fluctuations of these spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the St$\ddot u$ckelberg-modified massive Abelian 3-form theory in any arbitrary D-dimension of spacetime, we show that its classical gauge symmetry transformations are generated by the first-class constraints. We establish that the Noether conserved charge (corresponding to the local gauge symmetry transformations) is same as the standard form of the generator for the underlying local gauge symmetry transformations (expressed in terms of the first-class constraints). We promote these classical local, continuous and infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformations to their quantum counterparts Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations which are respected by the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities. We derive the conserved (anti-)BRST charges by exploiting the theoretical potential of Noether's theorem. However, these charges turn our to be non-nilpotent. Some of the highlights of our present investigation are (i) the derivation of the off-shell nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges from the standard non-nilpotent Noether conserved (anti-)BRST charges, (ii) the appearance of the operator forms of the first-class constraints at the quantum level through the physicality criteria w.r.t. the nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges, and (iii) the deduction of the CF-type restrictions from the straightforward equality of the coupled (anti-)BRST invariant Lagrangian densities as well as from the requirement of the absolute anticommutativity of the off-shell nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges.</description>

      <title>Quantizing a Non-locally Massive 2-form Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-local yet gauge-invariantly massive 2-form model is considered that leads to local and unitary dynamics upon proper gauge-fixing. Since canonical momenta cannot be defined owing to the non-locality, consistent quantization of this system warrants particular care. We construct the Dirac brackets and covariant commutators for this model, followed by its path integral quantization, leading to consistent results. These treatments underline the most efficient way to extract the physical modes and the subsequent spectrum free from infrared ambiguity. Physically the massive 2-form represents a spin-1 excitation, with potential application to string theory and cosmology, that can mediate a screened interaction when topologically coupled to fermions.</description>

      <title>Higher-order tails and RG flows due to scattering of gravitational radiation from binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish and develop a novel methodology to treat higher-order non-linear effects of gravitational radiation that is scattered from binary inspirals, which employs modern scattering-amplitudes methods on the effective picture of the binary as a composite particle. We spell out our procedure to study such effects: assembling tree amplitudes via generalized-unitarity methods and employing the closed-time-path formalism to derive the causal effective actions, which encompass the full conservative and dissipative dynamics. We push through to a new state of the art for these higher-order effects, up to the third subleading tail effect, at order G5N and the 5-loop level, which corresponds to the 8.5PN order. We formulate the consequent dissipated energy for these higher-order corrections, and carry out a renormalization analysis, where we uncover new subleading RG flow of the quadrupole coupling. For all higher-order tail effects we find perfect agreement with partial observable results in PN and self-force theories, where available.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence for Vertex Operator Superalgebras from Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

Abstract: Multi-parameter families of $\mathcal{N}=0$ Type IIA and Type IIB AdS$_5$ solutions are presented, promoting to $\mathcal{N}=1$ in some special cases. The G-Structure description of each $\mathcal{N}=1$ solution is given, requiring an Abelian T-Duality of the G-Structure conditions and Pure Spinors. Investigations at the boundaries are performed for a two-parameter family of Type IIA and a three-parameter family of Type IIB solutions, finding the presence of orbifold singularities in some backgrounds. All parameters drop out of the Holographic Central Charge calculation, pointing to marginal deformations in the dual CFT description.</description>

      <title>Peierls Transition in Gross-Neveu Model from Bethe Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Gross-Neveu model is anticipated to undergo a crystalline phase transition at high baryon charge densities. This conclusion is drawn from the mean-field approximation, which closely resembles models of Peierls instability. We demonstrate that this transition indeed occurs when both the rank of the symmetry group and the dimension of the particle representation contributing to the baryon density are large (the large-N limit). We derive this result through the exact solution of the model, developing the large-N limit of the Bethe Ansatz. Our analytical construction of the large-N solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations aligns perfectly with the periodic (finite-gap) solution of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) of the mean-field analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the intricate real-time dynamics of a non-Hermitian system composed of two interconnected Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. A central finding reveals that an excitation initially localized in the right SYK subsystem can be efficiently transmitted to the left subsystem subsequent to the characteristic scrambling time, a phenomenon facilitated by the intrinsic non-Hermitian nature of the system. The defining hallmark of non-Hermiticity is manifest in the asymmetric conveyance of quantum states, with the non-Hermitian parameter functioning as a tunable knob that selectively amplifies or dampens propagation modes on either side. Despite this inherent directional bias in state transfer, the system sustains two distinct phases, analogously likened to black holes and wormholes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine generalized symmetries for 4D theories engineered via type II strings on non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times \mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Probe branes detect generalized symmetries via the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in an associated quiver gauge theory. In situations where the tachyons are sequestered away from the boundary $S^5 / \Gamma$, this exactly matches the result extracted from singular homology. In situations with an unsequestered tachyon which stretches out to the boundary, the presence of tachyonic pulses partitions up the space into several distinct sectors, and the net contribution again matches with the answer expected via quiver methods. For IIA backgrounds, the presence of a localized closed string tachyon leads to transitions in the spectrum of states, generalized symmetries, higher-group symmetries, as well as the level matrix of the associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). For IIB backgrounds with a stack of spacetime filling probe D3-branes, the onset of a radiatively generated potential leads to similar considerations involving scale dependent transitions in the symmetries of the theory, including structures such as duality defects / interfaces.</description>

Abstract: We propose mixed boundary conditions for 3d conformal gravity consistent with variational principle in its second-order formalism that admit the chiral $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra as their asymptotic symmetry algebra. This algebra is one of the four chiral $\mathcal W$-algebra extensions of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ and is a generalisation of the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra responsible for soft theorems of graviton MHV amplitudes in ${\mathbb R}^{1,3}$ gravity to the case of non-zero negative cosmological constant. The corresponding charges calculated using the modified covariant phase space formalism are shown to be finite and integrable, and realise this non-linear ${\cal W}$-algebra.</description>

Abstract: We consider the classical field theory of 2+1-dimensional Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory on an arbitrary spatial manifold. We first define a gauge covariant transverse electric field strength, which together with the gauge covariant scalar magnetic field strength can be taken as coordinates on the classical phase space. We then determine the Poisson-Dirac bracket and find that these coordinates are canonically conjugate to each other. The Hamiltonian is non-polynomial when expressed in terms of these coordinates, but can be expanded in a power series in the coupling constant with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the continuous symmetry transformations for the three ($2 + 1$)-dimensional (3D) system of a combination of the free Abelian 1-form and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. We establish that this combined system is a tractable field-theoretic model of Hodge theory. The symmetry operators of our present theory provide the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. Our present investigation is important in the sense that, for the first time, we are able to establish an odd dimensional (i.e. $D = 3$) field-theoretic system to be an example for Hodge theory (besides earlier works on a few interesting ($0 + 1$)-dimensional toy models as well as a set of well-known ${\mathcal N} = 2$ SUSY quantum mechanical systems of physical interest). For the sake of brevity, we have not taken into account the 3D Chern-Simon term for the Abelian 1-form gauge field in our theory which allows the mass and gauge-invariance to co-exist together.</description>

Abstract: By working with the covariant phase space formalism, we have shown that not only can the Hamiltonian conjugate to a Killing vector field $\xi$ be expressed as the sum of the associated Noether charge and $\xi$ contracted with the Hilbert action boundary term for F($R_{abcd}$) gravity, but also be written as its contraction with another $\xi$ independent tensor field. With this, we have proven the equivalence of Noether charge and Hilbert action boundary term formulae for the stationary black hole entropy in F($R_{abcd}$) gravity, which is further substantiated by our explicit computation using both formulae.</description>

Abstract: We study the anomalies of two-dimensional BPS defects in six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theories. Using a holographic description of these defects furnished by probe D4-branes in AdS${}_7$ solutions of ten-dimensional type IIA supergravity, we compute the two independent defect Weyl anomalies from the on-shell action for a spherical defect and defect sphere entanglement entropy. We find agreement between the holographic prediction for the defect A-type anomaly coming from the defect sphere free energy and the leading large $N$ contribution to the defect `t Hooft anomaly found using anomaly inflow. We also find agreement between the holographic computation of the expectation value of a surface operator wrapping a torus and the supersymmetric localization computation for a circular Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory on $S^5$. Lastly, we holographically compute the defect gravitational anomaly from the Wess-Zumino action of the probe D4-brane, which provides a subleading large $N$ correction to the defect A-type anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the massive states in F-theory compactification models, including BPS string junctions stretching between parallel 7-branes and KK modes. We obtain analytical results when there are two colliding bunches of 7-branes with a locally constant axiodilaton profile. In particular, in 8D F-theory setups when the 7-branes collide into a codimension-one $(4,6,12)$ singularity, we found an infinite light tower of BPS string junctions, which should match the light KK tower in the dual heterotic description. To exactly match with the results in the distance conjecture, we propose that the definition of 8D Planck mass should receive a large correction. We have also computed parts of KK modes in 8D F-theory in a simplified setup, as well as the BPS string junction spectrum in specific setups of 6D and 4D F-theory.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the geodesics connecting two time-like separated boundary points in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. We find that in spherically symmetry Schwarzschild AdS black hole, smooth space-like geodesics can connect timelike-separated points by winding around the horizon multiple times. Similar result will also happen in modified BTZ black hole which contains photon ring in the bulk. According to recent holographic proposal on time-like entanglement entropy, our result suggests that, if there is photon ring/sphere in the bulk, then the time-like entanglement entropy AdS3/CFT2 duality may not have an imaginary part and so further understanding may be necessary.</description>

It has been suggested that in the presence of gravity, any local effective field theory description must break down at the "species scale". We first observe that unitarity and analyticity of the amplitude indeed imply a species-type bound $G\Lambda^{d-2}N\leq O(1)$, where $N$ counts parametrically light species and $\Lambda$ is an energy scale above which new unknown ingredients must modify the graviton amplitude. To clarify what happens at this scale, we contrast the partial wave decomposition of calculated amplitudes with that of some ultraviolet scenarios: string theory and strongly interacting Planck-scale physics. Observing that the latter exhibit a markedly stronger high-spin content, we define nonperturbatively the high-spin onset scale $\Lambda_{\rm o}$, which coincides with the string scale and higher-dimensional Planck scale in respective examples. We argue that, generally, no local field description can exist at distances shorter than $1/\Lambda_{\rm o}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Hawking radiation in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for minimally coupled massless and massive scalar fields. We employ a holography-inspired technique to derive the Bogoliubov coefficients. We consider both black holes in equilibrium and black holes attached to a bath. In the latter case, we compute semiclassical deviations from the thermal spectrum.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative phase boundaries in the Gross-Neveu model from a stability analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two out of three phase boundaries of the 1+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the chiral limit can be obtained from a standard, perturbative stability analysis of the homogeneous phases. The third one separating the massive homogeneous phase from the kink crystal is non-perturbative and could so far only be inferred from the full solution of the model. We show that this phase boundary can also be obtained via a modified stability analysis, based on the thermodynamic potential of a single kink or baryon. The same method works for the massive Gross-Neveu model, so that all phase boundaries of the Gross-Neveu model could have been predicted quantitatively without prior knowledge of the full crystal solution.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the pole-skipping structure in de Sitter (dS) spacetime and find that their leading frequencies satisfy the relation $\omega_{dS}=i2\pi T_{dS}(1-s)$ with $T_{dS}$ denotes $T_{dS}=1/2\pi L$ and $s$ spin. In the two-dimensional dS spacetime, the pole-skipping points near the cosmic horizon $r=L$ for the scalar field of spin-0 and the fermionic field of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ correspond one-to-one with those in the infinite temperature limit of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (DSSYK$_\infty$). The retarded Green's functions of these two systems also have similar forms at the pole-skipping positions. This provides a numerical correspondence between the static patch of dS$_2$ spacetime and the DSSYK$_\infty$ model.</description>

      <title>Violent nonlinear collapse in the interior of charged hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new one-parameter family indexed by $\epsilon$ of two-ended, spatially-homogeneous black hole interiors solving the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations with a (possibly zero) cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and bifurcating off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(dS/AdS) interior ($\epsilon = 0$). For all small $\epsilon \neq 0$, we prove that, although the black hole is charged, its terminal boundary is an everywhere-spacelike Kasner singularity foliated by spheres of zero radius $r$.
  Moreover, smaller perturbations (i.e. smaller $|\epsilon|$) are more singular than larger one, in the sense that the Hawking mass and the curvature blow up following a power law of the form $r^{-O(\epsilon^{-2})}$ at the singularity $\{r=0\}$. This unusual property originates from a dynamical phenomenon -- violent nonlinear collapse -- caused by the almost formation of a Cauchy horizon to the past of the spacelike singularity $\{r=0\}$. This phenomenon was previously described numerically in the physics literature and referred to as "the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge".
  While we cover all values of $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, the case $\Lambda&lt; 0$ is of particular significance to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our result can also be viewed in general as a first step towards the understanding of the interior of hairy black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unifying quantum theory and gravity remains a fundamental challenge in physics. While most existing literature focuses on the ultraviolet (UV) modifications of quantum theory due to gravity, this work shows that generic infrared (IR) modifications arise when we describe quantum theory in curved spacetime. We explicitly demonstrate that the modifications to the position-momentum algebra are proportional to curvature invariants (such as the Ricci scalar and Kretschmann scalar). Our results, derived through a rigorous application of Dirac's quantization procedure, demonstrate that infrared effects in quantum systems can be axiomatically derived. We study particle dynamics in an arbitrary curved spacetime by embedding them in a higher-dimensional flat geometry. Our approach, which involves embedding particle dynamics in a higher-dimensional flat geometry and utilizing Dirac's quantization procedure, allows us to capture the dynamics of a particle in 4-dimensional curved spacetime through a modified position-momentum algebra. When applied to various spacetimes, this method reveals that the corrections due to the spacetime curvature are universal. We further compare our results with those derived using extended uncertainty principles. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for black holes and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Testing the Speed of Gravity with Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the speed of gravitational waves, $c_{GW}$, can be tested by upcoming black hole ringdown observations. We do so in the context of hairy black hole solutions, where the hair is associated with a new scalar degree of freedom, forecasting that LISA and TianQin will be able to constrain deviations of $c_{GW}$ from the speed of light at the ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$ level from a single supermassive black hole merger. We discuss how these constraints depend on the nature of the scalar hair, what different aspects of the underlying physics they are sensitive to in comparison with constraints derived from gravitational wave propagation effects, which observable systems will place the most stringent bounds, and that constraints are expected to improve by up to two orders of magnitude with multiple observations. This is especially interesting for dark energy-related theories, where existing bounds from GW170817 need not apply at lower frequencies and where upcoming bounds from lower-frequency missions will therefore be especially powerful. As such, we also forecast analogous bounds for the intermediate-frequency AEDGE and DECIGO missions. Finally, we discuss and forecast analogous black hole ringdown constraints at higher frequencies (so from LVK, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and in what circumstances they can yield new information on top of existing constraints on $c_{GW}$. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via a companion Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the quantum vacuum in a radiation-dominated and CPT-invariant universe by further imposing the quantum states to be ultraviolet regular i.e., satisfying the Hadamard/adiabatic condition. For scalar fields, this is enforced by constructing the vacuum via the States of Low Energy proposal. For spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fields, we extend this proposal for a FLRW spacetime and apply it for the radiation-dominated and CPT-invariant universe. We focus on minimizing the smeared energy density around the Big Bang and give strong evidence that the resulting states satisfy the Hadamard/adiabatic condition. These states are then self-consistent candidates as effective Big Bang quantum vacuum from the field theory perspective.</description>

      <title>Practical Dirac Majorana confusion theorem: Issues and Applicability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05654v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We inspect the model-independent study of practical Dirac Majorana confusion theorem (pDMCT) -- a wide spread belief that the difference between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos via any kinematical observable would be practically impossible to determine because of the difference only being proportional to the square of neutrino mass -- in context of processes that have at least a neutrino antineutrino pair in their final state. We scrutinize the domain of applicability of pDMCT and also highlight those aspects that are often misunderstood. We try to clarify some of the frequently used concepts that are used to assert pDMCT as a generic feature irrespective of the process, or observable, such as the existence of any analytic continuity between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in the limit mass(neutrino) -&gt; 0. In summary, we illustrate that pDMCT is not any fundamental property of neutrinos, instead, it is a phenomenological feature of neutrino non-observation, depending on models and processes.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate how to use the generalized $\delta N$ formalism, which enables us to compute the evolution of all the large scale fluctuations, including gravitational waves, solely by solving the evolution of the background homogeneous Universe. Using the Noether charge density, we derive an analytic formula which describes the mapping between the fluctuations at the horizon crossing and the sourced gravitational waves at the end of inflation. This formula can apply also to an inflation model with an anisotropic background. Using this formula, we discuss the condition for the non-vanishing linear polarization and the qualitative difference between single- and multi-gauge field models.</description>

      <title>Corrections to diffusion in interacting quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport and the approach to equilibrium in interacting classical and quantum systems is a challenging problem of both theoretical and experimental interest. One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the dissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this paper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically obtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale simulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In particular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the dynamical structure factor $\langle n(x,t)n\rangle$, in the presence of a single $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ charge in systems with and without particle-hole symmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple charges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions for subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for thermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we perform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1d Floquet systems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT which becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show how the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can improve the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times accessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore non-linear response in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction for its behavior. Our results provide a basis for a better understanding of the non-linear phenomena present in thermalizing systems.</description>

      <title>The Quality/Cosmology Tension for a Post-Inflation QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is difficult to construct a post-inflation QCD axion model that solves the axion quality problem (and hence the Strong CP problem) without introducing a cosmological disaster. In a post-inflation axion model, the axion field value is randomized during the Peccei-Quinn phase transition, and axion domain walls form at the QCD phase transition. We emphasize that the gauge equivalence of all minima of the axion potential (i.e., domain wall number one) is insufficient to solve the cosmological domain wall problem. The axion string on which a domain wall ends must exist as an individual object (as opposed to a multi-string state), and it must be produced in the early universe. These conditions are often not satisfied in concrete models. Post-inflation axion models also face a potential problem from fractionally charged relics; solving this problem often leads to low-energy Landau poles for Standard Model gauge couplings, reintroducing the quality problem. We study several examples, finding that models that solve the quality problem face cosmological problems, and vice versa. This is not a no-go theorem; nonetheless, we argue that it is much more difficult than generally appreciated to find a viable post-inflation QCD axion model. Successful examples may have a nonstandard cosmological history (e.g., multiple types of cosmic axion strings of different tensions), undermining the widespread expectation that the post-inflation QCD axion scenario predicts a unique mass for axion dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing formulations of relativistic hydrodynamic theories, which, in order to be causal and stable, (i) either requires `non-fluid' variables apart from velocity and temperature to be promoted to new degrees of freedom, or, (ii) needs to be in a generalized hydrodynamic frame other than those given by Landau or Eckart. The BDNK stress tensor (originally in a general frame) has been rewritten in the Landau frame using linearized all-order gradient-corrected redefinitions of the temperature and velocity fields. The redefinitions indicate that, while the BDNK formalism has a finite number of derivatives in the general frame, when written in the Landau frame, it either has an infinite number of derivatives, or one has to introduce MIS-like `non-fluid' variables by summing the infinite number of derivatives in the field redefinitions. There can be non-unique ways of performing these infinite-order summations. Finally, the dispersion relations and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Stringent Tests of Lorentz Invariance Violation from LHAASO Observations of GRB 221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported the observation of the very early TeV afterglow of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, recording the highest photon statistics in the TeV band ever from a gamma-ray burst. We use this unique observation to place stringent constraints on an energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum, a manifestation of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity (QG) theories. Our results show that the 95% confidence level lower limits on the QG energy scales are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1}&gt;10$ times of the Planck energy $E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2}&gt;6\times10^{-8}E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the quadratic LIV effects, respectively. Our limits on the quadratic LIV case improve previous best bounds by factors of 5--7.</description>

      <title>Gravitational particle production and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of gravitational particle production of scalar particles on the total effective cosmic energy density (in the era after photon decoupling till the present) is considered. The effect is significant for heavy particles. It is found that gravitational particle production results in an effective increase in the directly measured value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ while it does not affect the value of the Hubble constant in the calculation of the number density of baryons at present time that is used to calculate recombination redshift. This may explain why the Hubble constant determined by local measurements and non-local measurements (such as CMB) are different. This suggests that gravitational particle production may have a non-negligible impact on the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: a Fisher Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters, loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Inflation at the Crossroads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of Cosmic Inflation to explain the latest Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data is assessed by performing Bayesian model comparison within the landscape of nearly three-hundred models of single-field slow-roll inflation. We present the first Bayesian data analysis based on the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra. In particular, the fourth Hubble-flow function $\epsilon_4$ remains unbounded while the third function verifies, at two-sigma, $\epsilon_{3}\in[-0.4,0.5]$, which is perfectly compatible with the slow-roll predictions for the running of the spectral index. We also observe some residual excess of $B$-modes within the BICEP/Keck data favoring, at a non-statistically significant level, non-vanishing primordial tensor modes: $\log(\epsilon_{1}) &gt; -3.9$, at $68\%$ confidence level. Then, for 283 models of single-field inflation, we compute the Bayesian evidence, the Bayesian dimensionality and the marginalized posteriors of all the models' parameters, including the ones associated with the reheating era. The average information gain on the reheating parameter $R_\mathrm{reh}$ reaches $1.3 \pm 0.18$ bits, which is more than a factor two improvement compared to the first Planck data release. As such, inflationary model predictions cannot meet data accuracy without specifying, or marginalizing over, the reheating kinematics. We also find that more than $40\%$ of the scenarios are now strongly disfavored, which shows that the constraining power of cosmological data is winning against the increase of the number of proposed models. In addition, about $20\%$ of all models have evidences within the most probable region and are all favored according to the Jeffreys' scale of Bayesian evidences.</description>

      <title>Some consequences of the Kerr-Schild gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03289v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Kerr-Schild nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime $\overline{g}_{\m\n}(x)$ are considered. Those are of the form $\overline{g}_{\m\n}+l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms, one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples for more general backgrounds (even including some simple sources) are discussed.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory suggests, on geometric grounds and with a physically-reasoned assumption that the excluded-volume size of neutrons is 20\% larger than that of protons, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$. This new ``geometric'' random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons is unphysical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Paczos et al. (Phys. Rev. D 110, 015006 (2024)) proposed a quantum field theory for free and interacting tachyon fields, which - unlike previous such attempts - is (claimed to be) covariant, have energy spectrum bounded from below, and Lorentz invariant (LI) vacuum. We show that the commutator of the proposed tachyon fields is not LI, and it violates microcausality except for tachyons moving with infinite speed. The proposed Feynman propagator (FP) is based on flawed analogy with QED and actually leads to unitarity violation. The actual FP, the two-point time-ordered correlation function, is neither LI nor a Green's function. Moreover, the potential for an interacting tachyon is shown to be unprotected from quantum corrections that generate tachyon self-interactions, which affects the stability of the tachyonic vacuum. Our analysis indicates that the proposed theory is not covariant, and that the tachyonic vacuum is likely unstable, indicating that superluminal observers are not physical. Therefore, the extended principle of relativity is void and cannot be used to derive nondeterministic description of Nature similar to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chronology Protection Conjecture in The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC) was first introduced by Hawking after his semi-classical investigation to the behaviour of a spacetime with closed timelike curves (CTCs) in response to scalar perturbation. It is argued that there would be instabilities leading to amplification of the perturbation and finally causing collapse of the region with CTCs. In this work, we investigate the CPC by exactly solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the region inside the inner horizon of the non-extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen~(KS) black hole, where closed timelike curves exist. Successfully find the exact radial solution, we apply the polynomial condition that turns into rule of the energy quantization. The quasinormal modes~(QNMs) of the scalar fields in the region inside the inner horizon of the rotating black hole with nonzero energy have only positive imaginary part describing states that grow in time. The exponentially growing modes will backreact and deform the spacetime region where CTC exists. The CPC is proven to be valid in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime. Moreover, since the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole is the most general axisymmetric black hole solution of the string inspired Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, the semiclassical proof in this work is also valid for all simpler rotating black holes of the EMDA theory. The structure of the Dyonic KS spacetime distinctive from the Kerr-Newman counterpart is also explored.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is split in two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements sample comprising of 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements sample including 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These 31 measurements are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between the two samples. The distance ladder-based sample yields a best fit $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.52$ indicating some correlations. The one-step measurements result in $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=1.43$ indicating some internal tension. If two outlier measurements are removed (TDCOSMO.I-2019 known to have systematics and MCP-2020) the best fit of the one step sample reduces to $H_0 = 68.3 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=1.01$, fully self-consistent and consistent with sound horizon based measurements. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.0001 suggesting that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early and late-time measurements, but between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>
