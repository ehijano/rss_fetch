      <title>AAS Graduate Admissions Task Force: Final report and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In March of 2024 the AAS formed our Graduate Admissions Task Force (GATF), asking us to produce recommendations aimed at improving the state of graduate admissions in astronomy. The task was a timely one, as the past decade has seen dramatic shifts that are currently being exacerbated by rapidly-shifting funding and policy challenges. The GATF surveyed recent applicants to astronomy graduate school and admissions leaders in degree-granting graduate programs, held in-depth conversations with select programs, and explored how other fields approach admissions. Based on this work, we have quantified recent changes in the astronomy graduate admissions landscape, addressed mismatches between perception and reality, and identified several key ways to address some of our current challenges. In this report we summarize the results of this work and the four main recommendations we believe the AAS should take to make lasting positive changes. We emphasize that the goal of our report, and the GATF's work, is not to help programs select students, or to help applicants get into graduate school. Instead, we have focused on ways to make the admissions process itself more streamlined, fair, and efficient for everyone involved.</description>

      <title>Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis with Vela.jl: the wideband paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vela.jl is a package for performing Bayesian pulsar timing &amp; noise analysis written in Julia and Python. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, simultaneous time of arrival and dispersion measure measurements are derived from a radio observation using frequency-resolved integrated pulse profiles and templates without splitting the observation into multiple frequency sub-bands. We describe the implementation of the wideband timing paradigm in Vela.jl, and demonstrate its usage using the NANOGrav 12.5-year wideband data of PSR J1923+2515. Vela.jl is the first software package to provide this functionality.</description>

      <title>LITMUS: Bayesian Lag Recovery in Reverberation Mapping with Fast Differentiable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping is a technique in which the mass of a Seyfert I galaxy's central supermassive black hole is estimated, along with the system's physical scale, from the timescale at which variations in brightness propagate through the galactic nucleus. This mapping allows for a long baseline of time measurements to extract spatial information beyond the angular resolution of our telescopes, and is the main means of constraining supermassive black hole masses at high redshift. The most recent generation of multi-year reverberation mapping campaigns for large numbers of active galactic nuclei (e.g. OzDES) have had to deal with persistent complications of identifying false positives, such as those arising from aliasing due to seasonal gaps in time-series data. We introduce LITMUS (Lag Inference Through the Mixed Use of Samplers), a modern lag recovery tool built on the "damped random walk" model of quasar variability, built in the autodiff framework JAX. LITMUS is purpose built to handle the multimodal aliasing of seasonal observation windows and provides evidence integrals for model comparison, a more quantified alternative to existing methods of lag validation. LITMUS also offers a flexible modular framework for extending modelling of AGN variability, and includes JAX-enabled implementations of other popular lag recovery methods like nested sampling and the interpolated cross correlation function. We test LITMUS on a number of mock light curves modelled after the OzDES sample and find that it recovers their lags with high precision and a successfully identifies spurious lag recoveries, reducing its false positive rate to drastically outperform the state of the art program JAVELIN. LITMUS's high performance is accomplished by an algorithm for mapping the Bayesian posterior density which both constrains the lag and offers a Bayesian framework for model null hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>VUV Processing of Nitrile Ice: Direct Comparison of Branching in Ice and TPD Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between radiation chemistry and sublimation dynamics of condensed organic compounds on cold grains is fundamental to describe observed gas-phase and ice-phase molecular abundances in the ISM. Infrared measurements are generally used to identify molecules synthesized in irradiated ices in lab experiments, while mass spectrometric techniques have been used to monitor the products following temperature programmed desorption. The IR measurements are often used quantitatively to monitor chemical transformation of ices during the course of irradiation, but the gas phase methods applied with TPD generally do not permit quantitative branching determination. Here we combine reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) of ices with broadband rotational spectroscopy of the sublimed products, to study the branching of photoproducts produced by the VUV irradiation of condensed CH3CN and CH3CH2CN ices. This permits direct comparison between the ice-phase and gas-phase branching following temperature programmed desorption. This comparison is analogous to astronomical observations of ices in protostellar disks such as by the James Webb Space Telescope employed in conjunction with ALMA observations in the corresponding warm-up regions of the same objects. In the condensed CH3CN VUV processed ices we quantified the HCN, CH3NC, CH2CCNH, CH3NH2, and CH4 abundances. The CH3CH2CN ices also readily produced the corresponding isocyanide and HCN in addition to a significant yield of CH2CHCN. The ethyl cyanide ice produced CH3CHNH rather than CH3NH2 and no CH4 formation was observed. In the gas phase we detected the isocyanides, HCN and vinyl cyanide. The ice and gas phase relative abundances could be brought into agreement if the unknown IR band strength of the isocyanides C-N stretch is assumed to be ~3 times larger than that of the cyanides.</description>

      <title>Open Source High-Resolution Exoplanet Atmosphere Retrievals with POSEIDON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy (R &gt; 25,000) has opened new opportunities to characterize exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. By resolving individual lines in planetary emission and transmission spectra, one can sensitively probe the chemical inventory and temperature structure of exoplanets. However, a significant challenge to reliable and reproducible atmospheric inferences from high-resolution datasets has been the lack of open source codes for high-resolution retrievals. Here, we present a unified high-resolution retrieval framework, for both emission and transmission spectroscopy, made publicly available within the open source POSEIDON retrieval code. Our high-resolution retrieval framework is fast (typically &lt; 12 hours), accessible (no GPUs required), and well-documented via Python notebooks. We validate our framework by reproducing previous emission retrievals of the hot Jupiter WASP-77Ab and transmission retrievals of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b. Our results are broadly consistent with those of published works when making the same data detrending assumptions, but we demonstrate that user choices can subtly propagate into retrieved chemical abundances.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution and Data Unfolding with Mean Integrated Square Error Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.</description>

      <title>Measuring Long Stellar Rotation Periods (&gt;10 days) from TESS FFI Light Curves is Possible: An Investigation Using TESS and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotation period of a star is an important quantity that provides insight into its structure and state. For stars with surface features like starspots, their periods can be inferred from brightness variations as these features move across the stellar surface. TESS, with its all-sky coverage, is providing the largest sample of stars for obtaining rotation periods. However, most of the periods have been limited to shorter than the 13.7-day TESS orbital period due to strong background signals (e.g., scattered light) on those timescales. In this study, we investigated the viability of measuring longer periods (&gt; 10 days) from TESS light curves for stars in the Northern Continuous Viewing Zone (NCVZ). We first created a reference set of 272 period measurements longer than 10 days for K &amp; M dwarfs in the NCVZ using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) that we consider as the "ground truth" given ZTF's long temporal baseline of 6+ years. We then used the unpopular pipeline to de-trend TESS light curves and implemented a modified Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram that accounts for flux offsets between observing sectors. For 179 out of the 272 sources (66%), the TESS-derived periods match the ZTF-derived periods to within 10%. The match rate increases to 81% (137 out of 170) when restricting to sources with a TESS LS power that exceeds a threshold. Our results confirm the capability of measuring periods longer than 10 days from TESS data, highlighting the dataset's potential for studying slow rotators.</description>

      <title>Operational and Exploration Requirements and Research Capabilities for SEP Environment Monitoring and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating risks posed by solar energetic particles (SEPs) to operations and exploration in space and Earth's atmosphere motivates the development of advanced, synergistic approaches for monitoring, modeling, and analyzing space weather conditions. The consequences of SEPs and their interactions with the near-Earth space environment are numerous, including elevated radiation levels at aviation altitudes during major events, satellite damage, and health risks to astronauts, resulting in economic impacts and potential hazards for space exploration. This contribution will present a high-level overview of the operational requirements and research capabilities for SEP event environment monitoring and forecasting that were highlighted during a workshop at Georgia State University, held on October 16-19, 2024. Specifically, it summarizes the presented activities concerning the following: (1) Identifying needs for SEP event forecasting and nowcasting, including practical forecast timeframes; (2) Reviewing availability and coverage of the current observational data and identifying tangible data resources for research, operations and the R2O2R loop; (3) Mapping existing forecast capabilities and identifying meaningful modeling advances for research and operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main bottleneck in assessing the accuracy of Mars orbit is the unknown value of the asteroids in the Main Asteroid Belt. Nowadays a modeling with 343 asteroids as point masses is used, with the relative masses fitted to observational data. In the current work we propose an innovative methodology to reduce the number of asteroids implemented as point masses, thus reducing the number of parameters to be fitted, without a significant degradation of the postfit residuals.</description>

      <title>Trust, but verify: Reducing artificial light emissions and monitoring compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to reduce light pollution we have to reduce the overall amount of artificial light emissions. This is a consequence of the basic rules governing the propagation of light in the terrestrial environment. In this work I revisit the physical laws causing that (i) "all" artificial light emitted outdoors is lost or pollutant, (ii) the negative effects of light pollution depend monotonically on the local concentration of photons of anthropogenic origin, and (iii) this concentration depends linearly on the total artificial light emissions, weighted by the light pollution propagation functions. Setting total emission limits becomes necessary in order to ensure that the negative effects of light pollution do not surpass red-lines of unacceptable degradation of the natural night. Once these red-lines are socially agreed, monitoring compliance becomes a relevant task. Several complementary methods for assessing total light emissions are being used nowadays, including public inventories of installed lights, direct radiance measurements from ground or low Earth orbit satellites, and scattered radiance measurements using ground based detectors (night sky brightness monitoring). While updated administrative inventories could in principle be trusted, independent verification is a must. The required measurements pose in turn significant challenges: we discuss here how the variability of the terrestrial atmosphere sets a lower limit on the minimum emission changes that can be reliably detected by measurements, and propose some ways to improve this performance.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): From images to multiwavelength catalogues: the Euclid MERge Processing Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclid satellite is an ESA mission that was launched in July 2023. \Euclid is working in its regular observing mode with the target of observing an area of $14\,000~\text{deg}^2$ with two instruments, the Visible Camera (VIS) and the Near IR Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) down to $I_{\rm E} = 24.5~\text{mag}$ ($10\, \sigma$) in the Euclid Wide Survey. Ground-based imaging data in the \textit{ugriz} bands complement the \Euclid data to enable photo-$z$ determination and VIS PSF modeling for week lensing analysis. Euclid investigates the distance-redshift relation and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to $z\sim 2$. Generating the multi-wavelength catalogues from \Euclid and ground-based data is an essential part of the \Euclid data processing system. In the framework of the \Euclid Science Ground Segment (SGS), the aim of the MER Processing Function (PF) pipeline is to detect objects in the \Euclid imaging data, measure their properties, and MERge them into a single multi-wavelength catalogue. The MER PF pipeline performs source detection on both visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images and offers four different photometric measurements: Kron total flux, aperture photometry on PSF-matched images, template fitting photometry, and S\'ersic fitting photometry. Furthermore, the MER PF pipeline measures a set of ancillary quantities, spanning from morphology to quality flags, to better characterise all detected sources. In this paper, we show how the MER PF pipeline is designed, detailing its main steps, and we show that the pipeline products meet the tight requirements that Euclid aims to achieve on photometric accuracy. We also present the other measurements (e.g. morphology) that are included in the OU-MER output catalogues and we list all output products coming out of the MER PF pipeline.</description>

      <title>Architecture of Tianyu Software: Relative Photometry as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09107</link>

Abstract: Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>
