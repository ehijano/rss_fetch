      <title>Minkowski Problems for Geometric Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the theory of Minkowski problems for geometric measures in convex geometric analysis. The theory goes back to Minkowski and Aleksandrov and has been developed extensively in recent years. The paper surveys classical and new Minkowski problems studied in convex geometry, PDEs, and harmonic analysis, and structured in a conceptual framework of the Brunn-Minkowski theory, its extensions, and related subjects.</description>

      <title>Geometric measures in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory and their associated Minkowski problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding question in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory is what are the dual analogues of Federer's curvature measures for convex bodies. The answer to this is provided. This leads naturally to dual versions of Minkowski-type problems, which answer the question of what are necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure to be a dual curvature measure of a convex body. Sufficient conditions, involving measure concentration, are established for the existence of solutions to these problems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Geometry with AI: Multi-agent Generation of Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polytopes are one of the most primitive concepts underlying geometry. Discovery and study of polytopes with complex structures provides a means of advancing scientific knowledge. Construction of polytopes with specific extremal structure is very difficult and time-consuming. Having an automated tool for the generation of such extremal examples is therefore of great value. We present an Artificial Intelligence system capable of generating novel polytopes with very high complexity, whose abilities we demonstrate in three different and challenging scenarios: the Hirsch Conjecture, the k-neighbourly problem and the longest monotone paths problem. For each of these three problems the system was able to generate novel examples, which match or surpass the best previously known bounds. Our main focus was the Hirsch Conjecture, which had remained an open problem for over 50 years. The highly parallel A.I. system presented in this paper was able to generate millions of examples, with many of them surpassing best known previous results and possessing properties not present in the earlier human-constructed examples. For comparison, it took leading human experts over 50 years to handcraft the first example of a polytope exceeding the bound conjectured by Hirsch, and in the decade since humans were able to construct only a scarce few families of such counterexample polytopes. With the adoption of computer-aided methods, the creation of new examples of mathematical objects stops being a domain reserved only for human expertise. Advances in A.I. provide mathematicians with yet another powerful tool in advancing mathematical knowledge. The results presented demonstrate that A.I. is capable of addressing problems in geometry recognized as extremely hard, and also to produce extremal examples different in nature from the ones constructed by humans.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fr\'echet Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is a key measure of central tendency as a barycenter for a given set of points in a general metric space. It is computed by solving an optimization problem and is a fundamental quantity in statistics. In this paper, we study Fr\'echet means in tropical geometry -- a piecewise linear, combinatorial, and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry that has gained prominence in applications. A key property of Fr\'echet means is that uniqueness is generally not guaranteed, which is true in tropical settings. In solving the tropical Fr\'echet mean optimization problem, we obtain a geometric characterization of the collection of all Fr\'echet means in a general tropical space as a tropically and classically convex polytope. Furthermore, we prove that a certificate of positivity for finitely many quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ always exists, given that their quadratic homogeneous components are sums of squares. We propose an algorithm to symbolically compute the Fr\'echet mean polytope based on our exact quadratic optimization result and study its complexity.</description>

      <title>Fixed-strength spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spherical $t$-design is a finite subset $X$ of the unit sphere such that every polynomial of degree at most $t$ has the same average over $X$ as it does over the entire sphere. Determining the minimum possible size of spherical designs, especially in a fixed dimension as $t \to \infty$, has been an important research topic for several decades. This paper presents results on the complementary asymptotic regime, where $t$ is fixed and the dimension tends to infinity. We combine techniques from algebra, geometry, and probability to prove upper bounds on the size of designs, including an optimal bound for signed spherical designs. We also prove lower and upper bounds for approximate designs and establish an explicit connection between spherical and Gaussian designs.</description>

      <title>Umbel convexity and the geometry of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every $p\in(0,\infty)$, a new metric invariant called umbel $p$-convexity is introduced. The asymptotic notion of umbel convexity captures the geometry of countably branching trees, much in the same way as Markov convexity, the local invariant which inspired it, captures the geometry of bounded degree trees. Umbel convexity is used to provide a ``Poincar\'e-type" metric characterization of the class of Banach spaces that admit an equivalent norm with Rolewicz's property $(\beta)$. We explain how a relaxation of umbel $p$-convexity, called infrasup-umbel $p$-convexity, plays a role in obtaining compression rate bounds for coarse embeddings of countably branching trees. Local analogues of these invariants - fork $p$-convexity and infrasup-fork $p$-convexity - are introduced, and their relationship to Markov $p$-convexity and relaxations of the $p$-fork inequality is discussed. The metric invariants are estimated for a large class of Heisenberg groups, and in particular a parallelogram $p$-convexity inequality is proved for Heisenberg groups over $p$-uniformly convex Banach spaces. Finally, a new characterization of non-negative curvature is given.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Geometric Group Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book provides a self-contained introduction to geometric group theory. The topics range from an introduction of Cayley and Schreier graphs to Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth and amenability. We discuss the ping-pong lemma, quasi-isometries, growth of groups, hyperbolicity, and other related notions. The book is based on graduate courses and can be used for such a course or for independent study.</description>

      <title>Hypercube minor-universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $m$-minor-universal if every graph with at most $m$ edges (and no isolated vertices) is a minor of $G$. We prove that the $d$-dimensional hypercube, $Q_d$, is $\Omega\left(\frac{2^d}{d}\right)$-minor-universal, and that there exists an absolute constant $C &gt;0$ such that $Q_d$ is not $\frac{C2^d}{\sqrt{d}}$-minor-universal. Similar results are obtained in a more generalized setting, where we bound the size of minors in a product of finite connected graphs. A key component of our proof is the following claim regarding the decomposition of a permutation of a box into simpler, one-dimensional permutations: Let $n_1, \dots, n_d$ be positive integers, and define $X := [n_1] \times \dots \times [n_d]$. We prove that every permutation $\sigma: X \to X$ can be expressed as $\sigma = \sigma_1 \circ \dots \circ \sigma_{2d-1}$, where each $\sigma_i$ is a one-dimensional permutation, meaning it fixes all coordinates except possibly one. We discuss future directions and pose open problems.</description>

      <title>The dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 states that if $D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is quasiconformally equivalently to an uniform domain, then the Gehring-Hayman inequality holds in $D$: quasihyperbolic geodesics in $D$ minimizes the Euclidean length among all curves in $D$ with the same end points, up to a universal dimension-dependent multiplicative constant.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strengthen the above result in the following three aspects: 1) obtain a dimension-free multiplicative constant in the Gehring-Hayman inequality; 2) relax the class of quasihyperbolic geodesics to more general quasigeodesics; 3) relax the quasiconformal equivalence to more general coarsely quasihyperbolic equivalence.
  As a byproduct of our general approach, we are able to prove that the above improved Gehring-Hayman inequality indeed holds in Banach spaces. This answers affirmatively an open problem raised by J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 and reformulated by J. V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} in 2005.</description>
