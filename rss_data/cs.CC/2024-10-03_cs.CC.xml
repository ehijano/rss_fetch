      <title>Approximating Klee's Measure Problem and a Lower Bound for Union Volume Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Union volume estimation is a classical algorithmic problem. Given a family of objects $O_1,\ldots,O_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we want to approximate the volume of their union. In the special case where all objects are boxes (also known as hyperrectangles) this is known as Klee's measure problem. The state-of-the-art algorithm [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] for union volume estimation and Klee's measure problem in constant dimension $d$ computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation with constant success probability by using a total of $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries of the form (i) ask for the volume of $O_i$, (ii) sample a point uniformly at random from $O_i$, and (iii) query whether a given point is contained in $O_i$.
  We show that if one can only interact with the objects via the aforementioned three queries, the query complexity of [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] is indeed optimal, i.e., $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Our lower bound already holds for estimating the union of equiponderous axis-aligned polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and even if the algorithm is allowed to inspect the coordinates of the points sampled from the polygons, and still holds when a containment query can ask containment of an arbitrary (not sampled) point.
  Guided by the insights of the lower bound, we provide a more efficient approximation algorithm for Klee's measure problem improving the $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ time to $O((n+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}) \cdot \log^{O(d)}n)$. We achieve this improvement by exploiting the geometry of Klee's measure problem in various ways: (1) Since we have access to the boxes' coordinates, we can split the boxes into classes of boxes of similar shape. (2) Within each class, we show how to sample from the union of all boxes, by using orthogonal range searching. And (3) we exploit that boxes of different classes have small intersection, for most pairs of classes.</description>

      <title>Optimization of a Quantum Subset Sum Oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implementation of an oracle for the Subset Sum problem for quantum search using Grover's algorithm. Our work concerns reducing the number of qubits, gates, and multi-controlled gates required by the oracle. We describe the compilation of a Subset Sum instance into a quantum oracle, using a Python library we developed for Qiskit and have published in GitHub. We then present techniques to conserve qubits and gates along with experiments showing their effectiveness on random instances of Subset Sum. These techniques include moving from fixed to varying-width arithmetic, using partial sums of a set's integers to determine specific integer widths, and sorting the set to obtain provably the most efficient partial sums. We present a new method for computing bit-string comparisons that avoids arbitrarily large multiple-control gates, and we introduce a simple modification to the oracle that allows for approximate solutions to the Subset Sum problem via Grover search.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Lossless Expanders in the Unbalanced Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first explicit construction of two-sided lossless expanders in the unbalanced setting (bipartite graphs that have many more nodes on the left than on the right). Prior to our work, all known explicit constructions in the unbalanced setting achieved only one-sided lossless expansion.
  Specifically, we show that the one-sided lossless expanders constructed by Kalev and Ta-Shma (RANDOM'22)--that are based on multiplicity codes introduced by Kopparty, Saraf, and Yekhanin (STOC'11)--are, in fact, two-sided lossless expanders.
  Using our unbalanced bipartite expander, we easily obtain lossless (non-bipartite) expander graphs on $N$ vertices with polynomial degree and a free group action. As far as we know, this is the first explicit construction of lossless (non-bipartite) expanders with $N$ vertices and degree $\ll N$.</description>
