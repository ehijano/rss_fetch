      <title>Multidimensional half-moment multigroup radiative transfer. Improving moment-based thermal models of circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of vertical inward and outward fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we aim to remove the interaction between beams in a fixed spatial direction by introducing a half-moment (HM) closure, which integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres. We derive a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replace it with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implement the HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We test these methods in numerical benchmarks, including computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing the results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The resulting HM closure tends to the correct limit in the diffusion regime and prevents interactions between crossing fluxes in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations with 22 frequency groups, the M1 closure disagrees with the MC midplane temperature by up to 21%, while HM reduces this discrepancy to 6%. Even with just 3 frequency groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks for Modeling Astrophysical Nuclear reacting flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysical simulations, nuclear reacting flows pose computational challenges due to the stiffness of reaction networks. We introduce neural network-based surrogate models using the DeePODE framework to enhance simulation efficiency while maintaining accuracy and robustness. Our method replaces conventional stiff ODE solvers with deep learning models trained through evolutionary Monte Carlo sampling from zero-dimensional simulation data, ensuring generalization across varied thermonuclear and hydrodynamic conditions. Tested on 3-species and 13-species reaction networks, the models achieve $\lesssim 1\%$ accuracy relative to semi-implicit numerical solutions and deliver a $\sim 2.6\times$ speedup on CPUs. A temperature-thresholded deployment strategy ensures stability in extreme conditions, sustaining neural network utilization above 75\% in multi-dimensional simulations. These data-driven surrogates effectively mitigate stiffness constraints, offering a scalable approach for high-fidelity modeling of astrophysical nuclear reacting flows.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Self-Calibration for ngVLA Dynamic Range Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ngVLA is a new interferometric radio astronomy facility with transformative capabilities, being developed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. It combines two orders of magnitude in frequency coverage, over 1.2 - 116 GHz, with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and spatial frequency coverage, opening up new discovery space, impacting nearly every area of astrophysics. The high sensitivity that enables the path breaking science goals, which in turn lead to stringent instrument requirements, also open up new approaches to meeting them, previously only possible in limited contexts. Chief among the requirements are the image dynamic range specifications of 45 dB and 35 dB at 8 GHz and 27 GHz in single pointing and mosaiced observations. As the baseline calibration strategy to meet these requirements, we leverage the high ngVLA sensitivity through routine use of self-calibration on short time scales to counter atmospheric delay fluctuations. We recognize the broader nature of the problem - requiring a certain dynamic range, DR, at a targeted science noise level {\sigma}_science presupposes the presence of bright emission in the field at a corresponding level of detected interferometric flux of \sim DR \times {\sigma}_science, by definition. With the problem posed broadly in this way, one can derive a general limit without recourse to background source counts and the attendant Poisson fluctuations of their occurrence, and which depends only on the number of antennas in the array and the science noise level of the observation, independent of the observing band, primary beam size and antenna SEFDs. This memo formally explores these ideas as the main strategy to achieve the ngVLA image dynamic range requirements.</description>

      <title>Approaches to High Dynamic Range Imaging - Application to the ngVLA</title>

As the baseline calibration strategy to meet these requirements, we leverage the high ngVLA sensitivity through routine use of self-calibration on short time scales to counter atmospheric delay fluctuations and pointing self-calibration to correct for pointing errors. A key benefit of leveraging self-calibration techniques, where possible, is the a reduction in system complexity of a range of subsystems, which in turn improves system reliability. Self-calibration also promises the possibility of attaining thermal noise limited dynamic range performance in some cases. This presentation provides the bases for these approaches, illustrating them to make the case for their application to the ngVLA in parallel.</description>

      <title>Environmental Monitoring Requirements for the ngVLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of environmental parameters is one of the basic requirements for the proper operation of a telescope. This memo is intended to provide guidance for the measurement accuracy requirements in the context of the ngVLA. It relies on previous work for ALMA (Mangum, 2001) and EVLA (Butler \&amp; Perley, 2008) and a review of the subject by Mangum \&amp; Wallace (2015). The local operational environment can be broadly divided into two categories: electromagnetic and physical. Meteorological parameters (weather) primarily constitute the physical environmental component and radio frequency interference (RFI) is the essential element of the electromagnetic environment. This memo focuses on the weather component and does not address the RFI, safety and physical infrastructure components. Under weather, the relevant topics are (1) the correction to pointing arising from refraction in the atmosphere (2) the different delays in the arrival times of signals at different antennas due to propagation in the atmosphere (3) monitoring weather parameters to provide operations support, e.g. in determining prevalence of precision or normal conditions, dynamic scheduling and the choice of antennas to constitute a sub-array with a given set of characteristics, among others, and (4) archival. Here we restrict ourselves to the first two topics which impact the data obtained and its calibration.</description>

      <title>Development of 6-inch 80-170 GHz broadband silicon plated horn antenna arrays for primordial gravitational wave search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for primordial gravitational wave in cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization signal is one of the key topics in modern cosmology. Cutting-edge CMB telescopes requires thousands of pixels to maximize mapping speed. Using modular design, the telescope focal plane is simplified as several detector modules. Each module has hundreds of pixels including antenna arrays, detector arrays, and readout arrays. The antenna arrays, as the beam defining component, determine the overall optical response of the detector module. In this article, we present the developments of 6-inch broadband antenna arrays from 80GHz to 170GHz for the future IHEP focal plane module. The arrays are fabricated from 42 6-inch silicon wafers including 456 antennas, 7% more pixels than usual design. The overall in-band cross polarization is smaller than -20 dB and the in-band beam asymmetry is smaller than 10%, fulfilling the requirements for primordial gravitational wave search.</description>

      <title>K-DRIFT Preparation: Experimental Verification of an Observation Strategy for Accurate Dark-Sky Flats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its scientific importance, the low-surface-brightness universe has yet to be fully explored due to various systematic uncertainties that affect the achievable surface-brightness limit. Reducing these uncertainties requires very accurate data processing. The dark-sky flat is a widely used calibration frame for accurate flat-field correction, generated by combining the sky background from science images. However, the night sky will likely contain complex local fluctuations, thus may still lead to photometric errors in data calibrated with dark-sky flats. To address this concern, we conduct mock observations with semi-realistic sky simulation data and evaluate observation strategies to mitigate the impact of the fluctuating sky background. Our experiments consider two representative sky conditions (clear and dirty) and perform intensive comparative analysis on two observation methods (offset and rolling). Our findings suggest that the rolling dithering method, which incorporates the operation of camera rotation into conventional dithering, can provide more accurate dark-sky flats. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of this method through additional experiments examining several factors that may affect the imaging quality of observational data.</description>

      <title>Dusty stellar sources classification by implementing machine learning methods based on spectroscopic observations in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dusty stellar point sources are a significant stage in stellar evolution and contribute to the metal enrichment of galaxies. These objects can be classified using photometric and spectroscopic observations with color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and infrared excesses in spectral energy distributions (SED). We employed supervised machine learning spectral classification to categorize dusty stellar sources, including young stellar objects (YSOs) and evolved stars (oxygen- and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and post-AGB (PAGB) stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, based on spectroscopic labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, which used 12 multiwavelength filters and 618 stellar objects. Despite missing values and uncertainties in the SAGE spectral datasets, we achieved accurate classifications. To address small and imbalanced spectral catalogs, we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic data points. Among models applied before and after data augmentation, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF), a tuned Random Forest (RF), achieved the highest total accuracy, reaching $\mathbf{89\%}$ based on recall in categorizing dusty stellar sources. Using SMOTE does not improve the best model's accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and RSG classes; it remains $\mathbf{100\%}$, $\mathbf{100\%}$, and $\mathbf{88\%}$, respectively, but shows variations for OAGB and YSO classes. We also collected photometric labeled data similar to the training dataset, classifying them using the top four PRF models with over $\mathbf{87\%}$ accuracy. Multiwavelength data from several studies were classified using a consensus model integrating four top models to present common labels as final predictions.</description>

      <title>Estimating Soil Electrical Parameters in the Canadian High Arctic from Impedance Measurements of the MIST Antenna Above the Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the bulk soil electrical conductivity and relative permittivity at a site in the Canadian High Arctic (79.37980 degrees N, 90.99885 degrees W). The soil parameters are determined using impedance measurements of a dipole antenna mounted horizontally 52 cm above the surface. The antenna is part of the Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST) radio cosmology experiment. The measurements were conducted on July 17-28, 2022, every 111 minutes, and in the frequency range 25-125 MHz. To estimate the soil parameters, we compare the impedance measurements with models produced from numerical electromagnetic simulations of the antenna, considering single- and two-layer soil models. Our best-fit soil model corresponds to a two-layer model in which the electrical parameters are consistent with unfrozen soil at the top and frozen soil underneath. The best-fit parameters further agree with measurements done at other Arctic sites with more traditional techniques, such as capacitively-coupled resistivity, electrical resistivity tomography, and ground-penetrating radar.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary Integration of Remote Sensing -- A Review with Four Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a high-level discipline, the development of remote sensing depends on the contribution of many other basic and applied disciplines and technologies. For example, due to the close relationship between remote sensing and photogrammetry, remote sensing would inevitably integrate disciplines such as optics and color science. Also, remote sensing integrates the knowledge of electronics in the conversion from optical signals to electrical signals via CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) or other image sensors. Moreover, when conducting object identification and classification with remote sensing data, mathematical morphology and other digital image processing technologies are used. These examples are only the tip of the iceberg of interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing. This work briefly reviews the interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing with four examples - ecology, mathematical morphology, machine learning, and electronics.</description>

      <title>A Short History of (Orbital) Decay: Roman's Prospects for Detecting Dying Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~10^5 transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, Q^{'}_{*}, of 10^6, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3} and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.</description>

      <title>Solving the PTA Data Analysis Problem with a Global Gibbs Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The announcement in the summer of 2023 about the discovery of evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has ignited both the PTA and the larger scientific community's interest in the experiment and the scientific implications of its findings. As a result, numerous scientific works have been published analyzing and further developing various aspects of the experiment, from performing tests of gravity to improving the efficiency of the current data analysis techniques. In this regard, we contribute to the recent advancements in the field of PTAs by presenting the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a low-frequency (red) noise process in these data. Our new method involves the use of a conjugate Jeffrey's-like multivariate prior which allows one to model all unique parameters of the global PTA-level red noise covariance matrix as a separate model parameter for which a marginalized posterior-probability distribution can be found using Gibbs sampling. Even though perfecting the implementation of the Gibbs sampling and mitigating the numerical stability challenges require further development, we show the power of this new method by analyzing realistic and theoretical PTA simulated data sets. We show how our technique is consistent with the more restricted standard techniques in recovering both the auto and the cross-spectrum of pulsars' low-frequency (red) noise. Furthermore, we highlight ways to approximately characterize a GWB (both its auto- and cross-spectrum) using Fourier coefficient estimates from single-pulsar and so-called CURN (common uncorrelated red noise) analyses via analytic draws from a specific Inverse-Wishart distribution.</description>

      <title>Photon Calibration Performance of KAGRA during the 4th Joint Observing Run (O4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KAGRA is a kilometer-scale cryogenic gravitational-wave (GW) detector in Japan. It joined the 4th joint observing run (O4) in May 2023 in collaboration with the Laser Interferometer GW Observatory (LIGO) in the USA, and Virgo in Italy. After one month of observations, KAGRA entered a break period to enhance its sensitivity to GWs, and it is planned to rejoin O4 before its scheduled end in October 2025. To accurately recover the information encoded in the GW signals, it is essential to properly calibrate the observed signals. We employ a photon calibration (Pcal) system as a reference signal injector to calibrate the output signals obtained from the telescope. In ideal future conditions, the uncertainty in Pcal could dominate the uncertainty in the observed data. In this paper, we present the methods used to estimate the uncertainty in the Pcal systems employed during KAGRA O4 and report an estimated system uncertainty of 0.79%, which is three times lower than the uncertainty achieved in the previous 3rd joint observing run (O3) in 2020. Additionally, we investigate the uncertainty in the Pcal laser power sensors, which had the highest impact on the Pcal uncertainty, and estimate the beam positions on the KAGRA main mirror, which had the second highest impact. The Pcal systems in KAGRA are the first fully functional calibration systems for a cryogenic GW telescope. To avoid interference with the KAGRA cryogenic systems, the Pcal systems incorporate unique features regarding their placement and the use of telephoto cameras, which can capture images of the mirror surface at almost normal incidence. As future GW telescopes, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to adopt cryogenic techniques, the performance of the KAGRA Pcal systems can serve as a valuable reference.</description>

      <title>SolarZip: An Efficient and Adaptive Compression Framework for Solar EUV Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: With the advancement of solar physics research, next-generation solar space missions and ground-based telescopes face significant challenges in efficiently transmitting and/or storing large-scale observational data. Aims: We develop an efficient compression and evaluation framework for solar EUV data, specifically optimized for Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) data, significantly reducing data volume while preserving scientific usability. Methods: We systematically evaluated four error-bounded lossy compressors across two EUI datasets. However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle the EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant resolution differences). Motivated by this, we develop an adaptive hybrid compression strategy with optimized interpolation predictors. Moreover, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework integrating distortion analysis with downstream scientific workflows, ensuring that observational analysis is not affected at high compression ratios. Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved up to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both traditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios than traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%. Simulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time by up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability. Conclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational data compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by dynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational scenarios and user requirements. This provides a promising data management solution for deep space missions like Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01239v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with unprecented energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to characterize the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic model for time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve vertex position resolution better than 20mm, energy resolution of about 2% at 1MeV and &lt;0.5% non-uniformity, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. With such resolution, we perceive MeV events to exhibit track effects. It opens up an exciting possibility of computed tracking calorimeter for unsegmented liquid scintillator detector like TAO. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>

      <title>Improved post-Newtonian waveform model for inspiralling precessing-eccentric compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of spin-precession and orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals is a key priority in GW astronomy, as these effects not only provide insights into the astrophysical formation and evolution of compact binaries but also, if neglected, could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation, searches, and tests of General Relativity. Despite the growing potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and future detectors to measure eccentric-precessing signals, accurately and efficiently modeling them remains a challenge. In this work, we present pyEFPE, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian (PN) waveform model for the inspiral of precessing-eccentric compact binaries. pyEFPE improves upon previous models by introducing analytical expressions for the Fourier mode amplitudes, enhancing the numerical stability of the multiple scale analysis framework, and adding recently derived PN corrections, critical to accurately describe signals in GW detectors. Additionally, we simplify the numerical implementation and introduce a scheme to interpolate the amplitudes, achieving a speedup of up to ~O(15) in the waveform computations, making the model practical for data analysis applications. We thoroughly validate pyEFPE by comparing it to other waveform models in the quasi-circular and eccentric-spin-aligned limits, finding good agreement. Additionally, we demonstrate pyEFPE's capability to analyze simulated GW events, accurately recovering the parameters of signals described by both pyEFPE and IMRPhenomXP. While pyEFPE still lacks important physical effects, such as higher-order PN corrections, higher-order modes, mode asymmetries, tidal interactions or the merger-ringdown phase, it represents a significant step towards more complete waveform models, offering a flexible and efficient framework that can be extended in future work to incorporate these effects.</description>

      <title>On the presence of a fifth force at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the upgraded 3-inch Hamamatsu photomultiplier for the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 3-inch Hamamatsu R14374-02 photomultiplier tube is an improved version of the R12199-02 model and its successor in the construction of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. A total of 1000 photomultipliers were analysed to assess their dark count rate, transit time spread, and spurious pulses. A subset of 200 photomultipliers were further evaluated to determine their quantum efficiency which is an essential parameter for Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response. The measurements show that R14374-02 model has better quantum efficiency homogeneity over the photocatode and better time properties than the R12199-02.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Detecting Signs of Life on Exoplanets in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for signs of life in the Universe has entered a new phase with the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Detecting biosignature gases via exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy is in principle within JWST's reach. We reflect on JWST's early results in the context of the potential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us with a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed spectra-already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate 3D atmospheric processes-can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST's quality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST is an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive "silver bullet" biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow "parallel interpretations" that will perhaps not be resolved until the next generation of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone planet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may continue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature gas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse methods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances and constraining the atmosphere context. Looking ahead, future telescopes and innovative observational strategies will be essential for the reliable detection of biosignature gases.</description>
