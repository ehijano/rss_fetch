      <title>Structured Reinforcement Learning for Delay-Optimal Data Transmission in Dense mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the data packet transmission problem (mmDPT) in dense cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) networks, i.e., users sending data packet requests to access points (APs) via uplinks and APs transmitting requested data packets to users via downlinks. Our objective is to minimize the average delay in the system due to APs' limited service capacity and unreliable wireless channels between APs and users. This problem can be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandits problem with fairness constraint (RMAB-F). Since finding the optimal policy for RMAB-F is intractable, existing learning algorithms are computationally expensive and not suitable for practical dynamic dense mmWave networks. In this paper, we propose a structured reinforcement learning (RL) solution for mmDPT by exploiting the inherent structure encoded in RMAB-F. To achieve this, we first design a low-complexity and provably asymptotically optimal index policy for RMAB-F. Then, we leverage this structure information to develop a structured RL algorithm called mmDPT-TS, which provably achieves an \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) Bayesian regret. More importantly, mmDPT-TS is computation-efficient and thus amenable to practical implementation, as it fully exploits the structure of index policy for making decisions. Extensive emulation based on data collected in realistic mmWave networks demonstrate significant gains of mmDPT-TS over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>CarbonCP: Carbon-Aware DNN Partitioning with Conformal Prediction for Sustainable Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to address carbon emission mitigation for end-to-end edge computing systems, including the computing at battery-powered edge devices and servers, as well as the communications between them. We design and implement, CarbonCP, a context-adaptive, carbon-aware, and uncertainty-aware AI inference framework built upon conformal prediction theory, which balances operational carbon emissions, end-to-end latency, and battery consumption of edge devices through DNN partitioning under varying system processing contexts and carbon intensity. Our experimental results demonstrate that CarbonCP is effective in substantially reducing operational carbon emissions, up to 58.8%, while maintaining key user-centric performance metrics with only 9.9% error rate.</description>

      <title>Colosseum: The Open RAN Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the Open Radio Access Network (RAN) paradigm transforming the fundamental ways cellular systems are deployed, managed, and optimized. This shift is led by concepts such as openness, softwarization, programmability, interoperability, and intelligence of the network, all of which had never been applied to the cellular ecosystem before. The realization of the Open RAN vision into practical architectures, intelligent data-driven control loops, and efficient software implementations, however, is a multifaceted challenge, which requires (i) datasets to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models; (ii) facilities to test models without disrupting production networks; (iii) continuous and automated validation of the RAN software; and (iv) significant testing and integration efforts. This paper poses itself as a tutorial on how Colosseum - the world's largest wireless network emulator with hardware in the loop - can provide the research infrastructure and tools to fill the gap between the Open RAN vision, and the deployment and commercialization of open and programmable networks. We describe how Colosseum implements an Open RAN digital twin through a high-fidelity Radio Frequency (RF) channel emulator and end-to-end softwarized O-RAN and 5G-compliant protocol stacks, thus allowing users to reproduce and experiment upon topologies representative of real-world cellular deployments. Then, we detail the twinning infrastructure of Colosseum, as well as the automation pipelines for RF and protocol stack twinning. Finally, we showcase a broad range of Open RAN use cases implemented on Colosseum, including the real-time connection between the digital twin and real-world networks, and the development, prototyping, and testing of AI/ML solutions for Open RAN.</description>

      <title>Exploring Wireless Channels in Rural Areas: A Comprehensive Measurement Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of wireless channel behavior has been an active research topic for many years. However, there exists a noticeable scarcity of studies focusing on wireless channel characteristics in rural areas. With the advancement of smart agriculture practices in rural regions, there has been an increasing demand for affordable, high-capacity, and low-latency wireless networks to support various precision agriculture applications such as plant phenotyping, livestock health monitoring, and agriculture automation. To address this research gap, we conducted a channel measurement study on multiple wireless frequency bands at various crop and livestock farms near Ames, Iowa, based on Iowa State University~(ISU)'s ARA Wireless Living lab - one of the NSF PAWR platforms. We specifically investigate the impact of weather conditions, humidity, temperature, and farm buildings on wireless channel behavior. The resulting measurement dataset, which will soon be made publicly accessible, represents a valuable resource for researchers interested in wireless channel prediction and optimization.</description>

      <title>Enhancing QoE in HTTP/3 using EPS Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HTTP/3, the latest evolution of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, utilizes QUIC, a new transport protocol leveraging UDP to overcome limitations such as connection time and head-of-line blocking prevalent in HTTP/2. This advancement is enhanced by the Extensible Prioritization Scheme (EPS), which introduces a flexible prioritization framework for improving website resource delivery. This paper proposes a mixed scheduling mechanism that delivers using mixed incremental and non-incremental resource delivery and adheres to EPS urgency levels to improve the QoE. Additionally, we propose an EPS priority mapping to enhance the QoE further. This mapping is based on the priority indicated by the Chromium browser and the resource type. The result of the experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed mechanism and mapping improve commonly-used website performance measures for sites featuring a comparatively large number and size of resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to play a crucial role in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems, offering potential applications in the scenarios of intelligent transportation, smart factories, etc. The performance of radar sensing in ISAC systems is closely related to the characteristics of radar sensing and communication channels. Therefore, ISAC channel modeling serves as a fundamental cornerstone for evaluating and optimizing ISAC systems. This article provides a comprehensive survey on the ISAC channel modeling methods. Furthermore, the methods of target radar cross section (RCS) modeling and clutter RCS modeling are summarized. Finally, we discuss the future research trends related to ISAC channel modeling in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>MIMO in network simulators: Design, implementation and evaluation of single-user MIMO in ns-3 5G-LENA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIMO technology has been studied in textbooks for several decades, and it has been adopted in 4G and 5G systems. Due to the recent evolution in 5G and beyond networks, designed to cover a wide range of use cases with every time more complex applications, it is essential to have network simulation tools (such as ns-3) to evaluate MIMO performance from the network perspective, before real implementation. Up to date, the well-known ns-3 simulator has been missing the inclusion of single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) models for 5G. In this paper, we detail the implementation models and provide an exhaustive evaluation of SU-MIMO in the 5G-LENA module of ns-3. As per 3GPP 5G, we adopt a hybrid beamforming architecture and a closed-loop MIMO mechanism and follow all 3GPP specifications for MIMO implementation, including channel state information feedback with precoding matrix indicator and rank indicator reports, and codebook-based precoding following Precoding Type-I (used for SU-MIMO). The simulation models are released in open-source and currently support up to 32 antenna ports and 4 streams per user. The simulation results presented in this paper help in testing and verifying the simulated models, for different multi-antenna array and antenna ports configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies have revolutionized industrial processes, enabling smart automation, real-time data analytics, and improved operational efficiency across diverse industry sectors. IIoT testbeds play a critical role in advancing IIoT research and development (R&amp;D) to provide controlled environments for technology evaluation before their real-world deployment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on existing IIoT testbeds, aiming to identify benchmark performance, research gaps and explore emerging trends in IIoT systems. We first review the state-of-the-art resource management solutions proposed for IIoT applications. We then categorize the reviewed testbeds according to their deployed communication protocols (including TSN, IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11 and 5G) and discuss the design and usage of each testbed. Driven by the knowledge gained during this study, we present suggestions and good practices for researchers and practitioners who are planning to design and develop IIoT testbeds for connectivity research.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Collisions in Sidelink NR V2X: A Study on Cooperative Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Sidelink (SL), an integral part of the 5G NR standard, is expected to revolutionize the automotive and rail industries by enabling direct and low-latency exchange of critical information between traffic participants independently of cellular networks. However, this advancement depends primarily on efficient SL resource allocation. Mode 2(a) is a well-known method for this purpose, where each node autonomously selects resources. However, this method is prone to packet collisions due to the hidden-node problem. In this paper, we propose a cooperative scheduling method that could potentially address this issue. We describe an extension of Mode 2(a) that allows nodes to share resource allocation information at two hops. Initial simulation results show a promising improvement over Mode 2(a).</description>

      <title>Integrating UAV-Enabled Base Stations in 3D Networks: QoS-Aware Joint Fronthaul and Backhaul Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging concept of 3D networks, integrating terrestrial, aerial, and space layers, introduces a novel and complex structure characterized by stations relaying backhaul loads through point-to-point wireless links, forming a wireless 3D backhaul mesh. A key challenge is the strategic placement of aerial platform such as drone base stations (DBSs), considering the locations and service demands of ground nodes and the connectivity to backhaul gateway nodes for core network access. This paper addresses these complexities with a two-fold approach: a novel Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (HC) algorithm that optimizes DBS locations to satisfy minimum backhaul adjacency and maximum fronthaul coverage radius requirements; and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that designs backhaul connections to satisfy the cumulative load across the network and maximize the throughput margin which translates to network resilience to increasing demands. Our results showcase the effectiveness of these algorithms against benchline schemes, offering insights into the operational dynamics of these novel 3D networks.</description>

      <title>HookChain: A new perspective for Bypassing EDR Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current digital security ecosystem, where threats evolve rapidly and with complexity, companies developing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions are in constant search for innovations that not only keep up but also anticipate emerging attack vectors. In this context, this article introduces the HookChain, a look from another perspective at widely known techniques, which when combined, provide an additional layer of sophisticated evasion against traditional EDR systems. Through a precise combination of IAT Hooking techniques, dynamic SSN resolution, and indirect system calls, HookChain redirects the execution flow of Windows subsystems in a way that remains invisible to the vigilant eyes of EDRs that only act on Ntdll.dll, without requiring changes to the source code of the applications and malwares involved. This work not only challenges current conventions in cybersecurity but also sheds light on a promising path for future protection strategies, leveraging the understanding that continuous evolution is key to the effectiveness of digital security. By developing and exploring the HookChain technique, this study significantly contributes to the body of knowledge in endpoint security, stimulating the development of more robust and adaptive solutions that can effectively address the ever-changing dynamics of digital threats. This work aspires to inspire deep reflection and advancement in the research and development of security technologies that are always several steps ahead of adversaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of globalization and digital networks, the so-called ''minored'' or ''endangered'' languages are facing a twofold dilemma: either succeed in their digital modernity by accepting a ''painful'' linguistic management or slide towards a slow extinction in front of hegemonic and ''predatory'' languages which dominate the digital networks.Oral languages and minored not-Romanized writings are the most concerned by the protective measures of the cultural and linguistic diversity on the Internet. Digital broadcasting and the Unicode multi-writing encoding system are providing them with innovative, consensual, and standardized alternatives to survive. Then, it depends on the synergy that their communities of practice will generate to place them at the heart of the debate on the digital divide.</description>

      <title>Compiler for Distributed Quantum Computing: a Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical realization of quantum programs that require large-scale qubit systems is hindered by current technological limitations. Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) presents a viable path to scalability by interconnecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) through quantum links, facilitating the distributed execution of quantum circuits. In DQC, EPR pairs are generated and shared between distant QPUs, which enables quantum teleportation and facilitates the seamless execution of circuits. A primary obstacle in DQC is the efficient mapping and routing of logical qubits to physical qubits across different QPUs, necessitating sophisticated strategies to overcome hardware constraints and optimize communication. We introduce a novel compiler that, unlike existing approaches, prioritizes reducing the expected execution time by jointly managing the generation and routing of EPR pairs, scheduling remote operations, and injecting SWAP gates to facilitate the execution of local gates. We present a real-time, adaptive approach to compiler design, accounting for the stochastic nature of entanglement generation and the operational demands of quantum circuits. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we model the optimal compiler for DQC using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, establishing the existence of an optimal algorithm, and (ii) we introduce a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to approximate this optimal compiler, tailored to the complexities of DQC environments. Our simulations demonstrate that Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQNs) are effective in learning policies that minimize the depth of the compiled circuit, leading to a lower expected execution time and likelihood of successful operation before qubits decohere.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Component Analysis Towards Effective VNF Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing concerns of knowledge transfer and data privacy challenge the traditional gather-and-analyse paradigm in networks. Specifically, the intelligent orchestration of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) requires understanding and profiling the resource consumption. However, profiling all kinds of VNFs is time-consuming. It is important to consider transferring the well-profiled VNF knowledge to other lack-profiled VNF types while keeping data private. To this end, this paper proposes a Federated Transfer Component Analysis (FTCA) method between the source and target VNFs. FTCA first trains Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on the source VNF profiling data, and the trained GANs model is sent to the target VNF domain. Then, FTCA realizes federated domain adaptation by using the generated source VNF data and less target VNF profiling data, while keeping the raw data locally. Experiments show that the proposed FTCA can effectively predict the required resources for the target VNF. Specifically, the RMSE index of the regression model decreases by 38.5% and the R-squared metric advances up to 68.6%.</description>

      <title>Open World Learning Graph Convolution for Latency Estimation in Routing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate routing network status estimation is a key component in Software Defined Networking. However, existing deep-learning-based methods for modeling network routing are not able to extrapolate towards unseen feature distributions. Nor are they able to handle scaled and drifted network attributes in test sets that include open-world inputs. To deal with these challenges, we propose a novel approach for modeling network routing, using Graph Neural Networks. Our method can also be used for network-latency estimation. Supported by a domain-knowledge-assisted graph formulation, our model shares a stable performance across different network sizes and configurations of routing networks, while at the same time being able to extrapolate towards unseen sizes, configurations, and user behavior. We show that our model outperforms most conventional deep-learning-based models, in terms of prediction accuracy, computational resources, inference speed, as well as ability to generalize towards open-world input.</description>

Abstract: Meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of terminals has imposed a signiffcant challenge on Multiaccess Edge Computing (MEC) systems, due to the limited multidimensional resources. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative MEC framework that facilitates resource sharing between the edge servers, and with the aim to maximize the long-term QoS and reduce the cache switching cost through joint optimization of service caching, collaborative offfoading, and computation and communication resource allocation. The dual timescale feature and temporal recurrence relationship between service caching and other resource allocation make solving the problem even more challenging. To solve it, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dual timescale scheme, called DGL-DDPG, which is composed of a short-term genetic algorithm (GA) and a long short-term memory network-based deep deterministic policy gradient (LSTM-DDPG). In doing so, we reformulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the small-timescale resource allocation decisions generated by an improved GA are taken as the states and input into a centralized LSTM-DDPG agent to generate the service caching decision for the large-timescale. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of the average QoS and cache switching cost.</description>

      <title>Competitive advantage of URLLC vs. eMBB for supporting timeliness-relevant services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G specifications promise a common and flexible-enough network infrastructure capable of satisfying diverse requirements of both current and future use cases. Two service types standardized in 5G are eMBB, without stringent delay guarantee, and URLLC, with stringent delay guarantee. We focus on a use case where data timeliness is the relevant quality parameter. We provide an economic rationale for the support of data-based services, that is, from the point of view of the profits attained by the service providers and operators (SP). More specifically, we focus on data-based services the quality of which is related to the Age of Information, and we assess two alternatives for the support of this sort of services by means of a 5G network: one that is based on the eMBB service type, and one that is based on the URLLC service type. These assessment is conducted in a duopoly scenario. We conclude that URLLC support provides a competitive advantage to an SP against a competitor SP that supports its service offering on eMBB. And that there is a slightly better situation for the users when the URLLC QoS constraint is stringent.</description>

      <title>Misconfiguration in O-RAN: Analysis of the impact of AI/ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User demand on network communication infrastructure has never been greater with applications such as extended reality, holographic telepresence, and wireless brain-computer interfaces challenging current networking capabilities. Open RAN (O-RAN) is critical to supporting new and anticipated uses of 6G and beyond. It promotes openness and standardisation, increased flexibility through the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, supports programmability, flexibility, and scalability with technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and cloud, and brings automation through the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). Furthermore, the use of xApps, rApps, and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) within the RIC enables efficient management of complex RAN operations. However, due to the open nature of O-RAN and its support for heterogeneous systems, the possibility of misconfiguration problems becomes critical. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the potential misconfiguration issues in O-RAN with respect to integration and operation, the use of SDN and NFV, and, specifically, the use of AI/ML. The opportunity for AI/ML to be used to identify these misconfigurations is investigated. A case study is presented to illustrate the direct impact on the end user of conflicting policies amongst xApps along with a potential AI/ML-based solution to this problem. This research presents a first analysis of the impact of AI/ML on misconfiguration challenges in O-RAN.</description>

      <title>Improving HTTP/3 Quality of Experience with Incremental EPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the introduction of QUIC, a modern transport-layer network protocol, HTTP/3 leverages its benefits to enhance web content delivery. This paper proposes a mechanism based on the recently standardized Extensible Prioritization Scheme (EPS) for weighted incremental web content delivery. The mechanism augments the sequential scheduling to provide incremental and weighted incremental resource delivery. An existing HTTP/3 implementation was extended with the proposed mechanism and tested with the content of eight popular websites. The results of our experimental analysis show that weighted incremental prioritization improves Quality of Experience (QoE) as measured by Lighthouse, a standard QoE test tool. While overall improvements were generally achieved, we also observed a few cases where the performance degraded slightly, highlighting that the QoE is sensitive to factors such as web page structure.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient All-to-All Collective Communication Schedules for Direct-Connect Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The all-to-all collective communications primitive is widely used in machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC) workloads, and optimizing its performance is of interest to both ML and HPC communities. All-to-all is a particularly challenging workload that can severely strain the underlying interconnect bandwidth at scale. This paper takes a holistic approach to optimize the performance of all-to-all collective communications on supercomputer-scale direct-connect interconnects. We address several algorithmic and practical challenges in developing efficient and bandwidth-optimal all-to-all schedules for any topology and lowering the schedules to various runtimes and interconnect technologies. We also propose a novel topology that delivers near-optimal all-to-all performance.</description>
