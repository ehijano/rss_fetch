      <title>Probability distribution in the Toda system: The singular route to a steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports on the evolution of the probability distribution in the configuration space of the two-dimensional Toda system. The distribution is characterized by singularities, which predominantly take two forms: double-cusped triangular lines and lines parallel to the equipotential line that defines the accessible region. Over time, the number of these singular patterns increases linearly. Consequently, at very large times, the singular patterns fully occupy the accessible area, resulting in a steady state probability distribution with a pronounced singular peak at the center. Changes in the singular patterns arise solely from the system's intrinsic dynamics rather than variations in its parameters, emphasizing the system's self-organizing nature over time. These results provide a deeper understanding of the collective motion of particles in symmetric, bounded, two-dimensional conservative systems.</description>

      <title>Breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov system and trigonometric Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to obtain a complete characterization of soliton and breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov (IDM) system, a vector generalization of the Ablowitz-Ladik model. The IDM system, which in the continuous limit reduces to the Manakov system (i.e., a 2-component vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation), was shown to admit a variety of discrete vector soliton solutions: fundamental solitons, fundamental breathers, and composite breathers. While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that characterize fundamental and composite breathers are given. This allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem and derive the associated Yang-Baxter maps describing the effect of interactions on the polarizations. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Our solution reveals a dual formulation in terms of two interacting Euler ensembles--one for hydrodynamic and another for magnetic circulation. This replaces empirical scaling laws with an infinite set of power terms with calculable decay exponents, some of which appear as complex-conjugate pairs related to the Riemann zeta function. A key result of our analysis is the explicit dependence of the solution on the Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pr} = \nu/\eta$), leading to a phase transition at $\mathrm{Pr} = 1$. In the $\mathrm{Pr}&lt;1$ regime, turbulence is dominated by hydrodynamic fluctuations, while for $\mathrm{Pr}&gt;1$, two distinct solutions emerge: a metastable one in which magnetic fluctuations grow with $\mathrm{Pr}$ and a stable one where they remain balanced with hydrodynamic fluctuations. We compare our theoretical predictions with recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) and discuss their implications for astrophysical plasmas, fusion devices, and laboratory MHD experiments. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding MHD turbulence and its dependence on fundamental parameters, offering a new perspective on turbulence in highly conducting fluids.</description>

      <title>Confluent Darboux transformations and Wronskians for algebraic solutions of the Painlev\'e III ($D_7$) equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the use of confluent Darboux transformations for Schr\"odinger operators, and how they give rise to explicit Wronskian formulae for certain algebraic solutions of Painlev\'e equations. As a preliminary illustration, we briefly describe how the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials arise in this way, thus providing well-known expressions for the tau functions of the rational solutions of the Painlev\'e II equation. We then proceed to apply the method to obtain the main result, namely a new Wronskian representation for the Ohyama polynomials, which correspond to the algebraic solutions of the Painlev\'e III equation of type $D_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study coupled complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (ccmKdV) equation by combining the Hirota's method and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) reduction method. First, we show that the bilinear form of the ccmKdV equation under nonzero boundary condition is linked to the discrete BKP hierarchy through Miwa transformation. Based on this finding, we construct the dark-dark soliton solution in the pfaffian form. The dynamical behaviors for one- and two-soliton are analyzed and illustrated.</description>

      <title>Recurrence relations for the generalized Laguerre and Charlier orthogonal polynomials and discrete Painlev\'e equations on the $D_{6}^{(1)}$ Sakai surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the discrete version of the Painlev\'e identification problem, i.e., how to recognize a certain recurrence relation as a discrete Painlev\'e equation. Often some clues can be seen from the setting of the problem, e.g., when the recurrence is connected with some differential Painlev\'e equation, or from the geometry of the configuration of indeterminate points of the equation. The main message of our paper is that, in fact, this only allows us to identify the configuration space of the dynamic system, but not the dynamics themselves. The refined version of the identification problem lies in determining, up to the conjugation, the translation direction of the dynamics, which in turn requires the full power of the geometric theory of Painlev\'e equations.
  To illustrate this point, in this paper we consider two examples of such recurrences that appear in the theory of orthogonal polynomials. We choose these examples because they get regularized on the same family of Sakai surfaces, but at the same time are not equivalent, since they result in non-equivalent translation directions. In addition, we show the effectiveness of a recently proposed identification procedure for discrete Painlev\'e equations using Sakai's geometric approach for answering such questions. In particular, this approach requires no a priori knowledge of a possible type of the equation.</description>

      <title>The generalised hodograph method for non-diagonalisable integrable systems of hydrodynamic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the system of first order PDEs for the pseudo-Riemannian metrics governing the Hamiltonian formalism for systems of hydrodynamic type. In the diagonal setting the Tsarev's integrability conditions ensure the compatibility of this system and, thanks to a classical theorem of Darboux, the existence of a family of solutions depending on functional parameters. In this paper we study the generalization of this result for the class of non-diagonalizable systems of hydrodymic type that naturally generalises Tsarev's integrable diagonal systems.</description>

      <title>Total masses of solutions to general Toda systems with singular sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.07759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we obtain total masses of solutions to the Toda system associated to a general simple Lie algebra with singular sources at the origin. The determination of such total masses is one of the important steps towards establishing the a priori bound for solutions to the mean field type of Toda system on compact surfaces. The total mass is found to be related to the longest element $\kappa$ in the Weyl group of the corresponding Lie algebra. This is the foundation to future work relating the local blowup masses (from analysis) with the Weyl group.
  This work generalizes the previous works in Lin et al. (2012), Ao et al. (2015) and Nie (20160 for Toda systems of types $A, G_2$ and $B, C$. However, a more Lie-theoretic method is needed here for the general case, and the method relies heavily on the DPW method, Drinfeld-Sokolov gauge and the $W$-invariants. The last crucial step for the total masses is obtained by applying the work of Kostant (1979) on the one dimensional Toda lattice.</description>

      <title>On the integrability of extended test body dynamics around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, the motion of an extended test body is influenced by its proper rotation, or spin. We present a covariant and physically self-consistent Hamiltonian framework to study this motion, up to quadratic order in the body's spin, including a spin-induced quadrupole, and in an arbitrary background spacetime. The choice of spin supplementary condition and degeneracies associated with local Lorentz invariance are treated rigorously with adapted tools from Hamiltonian mechanics. Applying the formalism to a background space-time described by the Kerr metric, we prove that the motion of any test compact object around a rotating black hole defines an integrable Hamiltonian system to linear order in the body's spin. Moreover, this integrability still holds at quadratic order in spin when the compact object has the deformability expected for an isolated black hole. Our analytical results shed light on longstanding numerical conjectures regarding spin-induced chaos in the motion of asymmetric compact binaries, and provides a powerful framework to improve current gravitational waveform modelling to account for spin-induced extended body effects.</description>

      <title>Generalized Buchdahl equations as Lie-Hamilton systems from the 'book' and oscillator algebras: Quantum deformations and their general solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the nonlinear second-order differential equations $$
  \ddot{x}(t)=a (x )\dot{x}(t)^2+b(t)\dot{x}(t)
  $$ where $a(x)$ and $b(t)$ are arbitrary functions on their argument from the perspective of Lie-Hamilton systems. For the particular choice $a(x)=3/x$ and $b(t)=1/t$, these equations reduce to the Buchdahl equation considered in the context of General Relativity. It is shown that these equations are associated to the 'book' Lie algebra $\mathfrak{b}_2$, determining a Lie-Hamilton system for which the corresponding $t$-dependent Hamiltonian and the general solution of the equations are given. The procedure is illustrated considering several particular cases. We also make use of the quantum deformation of $\mathfrak{b}_2$ with quantum deformation parameter $z$ (where $q={\rm e}^z$), leading to a deformed generalized Buchdahl equation. Applying the formalism of Poisson-Hopf deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, we derive the corresponding deformed $t$-dependent Hamiltonian, as well as its general solution. The generalized Buchdahl equation is further extended to the oscillator Lie-Hamilton algebra $\mathfrak{h}_4\supset \mathfrak{b}_2$, together with its quantum deformation, and the corresponding (deformed) equations are also analyzed for their exact solutions. The presence of the quantum deformation parameter $z$ is interpreted as the introduction of an integrable perturbation of the (initial) generalized Buchdahl equation, which is described in detail in its linear approximation. Finally, it is also shown that, under quantum deformations, the higher-dimensional deformed generalized Buchdahl equations from either the book or the oscillator algebras do not reduce to a sum of copies of the initial system but to intrinsic coupled systems governed by $z$.</description>
