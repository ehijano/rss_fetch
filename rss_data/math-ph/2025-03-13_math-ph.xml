      <title>The entropy and temperature of decoupled contributions to energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the existence of entropy and temperature is equivalent to a conservation law, which expresses the decoupling of hidden contributions to energy from the measurable ones with respect to some set of measurement procedures. We then apply this technique to define entropy and temperature in an arbitrary dynamical system, where a reduction procedure is specified that recovers the full geometric structure of thermodynamic phase space.</description>

      <title>Open Hurwitz Flat F manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive Open WDVV equations starting from any Hurwitz Dubrovin Frobenius manifold. The WDVV equations play a crucial role in the structure of Frobenius manifolds, quantum cohomology, and integrable systems. Extending these ideas, Open WDVV equations provide a framework to incorporate boundary conditions, making them fundamental in Open Gromov-Witten theory. Using Dubrovin's construction of Landau Ginzburg superpotentials associated with Hurwitz spaces, we demonstrate that their primitives satisfy Open WDVV equations. Our approach provides an efficient method for computing Open WDVV equations associated with any Hurwitz Dubrovin Frobenius manifold.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Localization and Transport properties of Quantum Walks on the hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coined Random Quantum Walks on the hexagonal lattice, where the strength of disorder is monitored by the coin matrix. Each lattice site is equipped with an i.i.d. random variable that is uniformly distributed on the torus and acts as a random phase in every step of the QW. We show dynamical localization in the regime of strong disorder, that is whenever the coin matrix is sufficiently close to the fully localized case, using a fractional moment criterion and a finite volume method. Moreover, we adapt a topological index to our model and thereby obtain transport for some coin matrices.</description>

      <title>Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$: polynomial algebras of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

      <title>The Topological form is the Pfaffian form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given graph $G$, Budzik, Gaiotto, Kulp, Wang, Williams, Wu, Yu, and the first author studied a ''topological'' differential form $\alpha_G$, which expresses violations of BRST-closedness of a quantum field theory along a single topological direction. In a seemingly unrelated context, Brown, Panzer, and the second author studied a ''Pfaffian'' differential form $\phi_G$, which is used to construct cohomology classes of the odd commutative graph complex. We give an explicit combinatorial proof that $\alpha_G$ coincides with $\phi_G$. We also discuss the equivalence of several properties of these forms, which had been established independently for both contexts in previous work.</description>

      <title>1-shifted Lie bialgebras and their quantizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define (cohomologically) 1-shifted Manin triples and 1-shifted Lie bialgebras, and study their properties. We derive many results that are parallel to those found in ordinary Lie bialgebras, including the double construction and the existence of a 1-shifted $r$-matrix satisfying the classical Yang-Baxter equation.
  Turning to quantization, we first construct a canonical quantization for each 1-shifted metric Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, producing a deformation to the symmetric monoidal category of $\mathfrak{g}$ modules over a formal variable $\hbar$. This quantization is in terms of a curved differential graded algebra. Under a further technical assumption, we construct quantizations of transverse Lagrangian subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$, which is a pair of DG algebras connected by Koszul duality, and give rise to monoidal module categories of the quantized double.
  Finally, we apply this to Manin triples arising from Lie algebras of loop groups, and construct 1-shifted meromorphic $r$-matrices. The resulting quantizations are the cohomologically-shifted analogue of Yangians.</description>

      <title>Holographic R\'enyi $n\to 0$ entropy and Euclidean fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit in the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_{d}$ context. This can be interpreted as a high temperature limit with respect to the notion of energy provided by the modular Hamiltonian describing the state of the system reduced to a subregion. We find, to the leading order in $n$, that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of an Euclidean irrotational perfect fluid. The fluid has vortex like boundary conditions at the boundary of the region. These vortices extends into the bulk in the form of a conical singularity, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <title>Circuits as a simple platform for the emergence of hydrodynamics in deterministic chaotic many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamics is one of the deepest phenomena in many-body systems. Arguably, the hydrodynamic equations are also the most important tools for predicting large-scale behaviour. Understanding how such equations emerge from microscopic deterministic dynamics is a century-old problem, despite recent progress in fine-tuned integrable systems. Due to the universality of hydrodynamics, the specific microscopic implementation should not matter. Here, we show that classical deterministic circuits provide a minimal, exact, and efficient platform that admits non-trivial hydrodynamic behaviour for deterministic but chaotic systems. By developing new techniques and focusing on 1D circuits as a proof of concept, we obtain the characteristic dynamics, including relaxation to Gibbs states, exact Euler equations, shocks, diffusion, and exact KPZ super-diffusion. Our methods can be easily generalised to higher dimensions or quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Moments of a Normalized Dissimilarity Ratio for two Correlated Gamma Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$ following correlated Gamma distributions, characterized by identical scale and shape parameters and a linear correlation coefficient $\rho$. Our focus is on the parameter: \[
  D(X,Y) = \frac{|X - Y|}{X + Y}, \] which appears in applied contexts such as dynamic speckle imaging, where it is known as the \textit{Fujii index}. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability density function of $D(X,Y)$ as well as analytical formulas for its moments of order $k$. Our derivation starts by representing $X$ and $Y$ as two correlated exponential random variables, obtained from the squared magnitudes of circular complex Gaussian variables. By considering the sum of $k$ independent exponential variables, we then derive the joint density of $(X,Y)$ when $X$ and $Y$ are two correlated Gamma variables. Through appropriate varable transformations, we obtain the theoretical distribution of $D(X,Y)$ and evaluate its moments analytically. These theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations, with particular attention to two specific cases: zero correlation and unit shape parameter.</description>

      <title>Tensor products and $R$-matrices for quantum toroidal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new topological coproduct $\Delta^{\psi}_{u}$ for quantum toroidal algebras $U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{tor}})$ in untwisted types, leading to a well-defined tensor product on the category $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathrm{int}}$ of integrable representations. This is defined by twisting the Drinfeld coproduct $\Delta_{u}$ with an anti-involution $\psi$ of $U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{tor}})$ that swaps its horizontal and vertical quantum affine subalgebras. Other applications of $\psi$ include generalising the celebrated Miki automorphism from type $A$, and an action of the universal cover of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$.
  Next, we investigate the ensuing tensor representations of $U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{tor}})$, and prove quantum toroidal analogues for a series of influential results by Chari-Pressley on the affine level. In particular, there is a compatibility with Drinfeld polynomials, and the product of irreducibles is generically irreducible. Furthermore, we obtain $R$-matrices with spectral parameter which provide solutions to the (trigonometric, quantum) Yang-Baxter equation, and endow $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathrm{int}}$ with a meromorphic braiding. These moreover give rise to a commuting family of transfer matrices for each module.</description>

      <title>Involutory Hopf group-coalgebras and invariants of flat bundles over 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give invariants of flat bundles over 4-manifolds generalizing a result by Chaidez, Cotler, and Cui (Alg. \&amp; Geo. Topology '22). We utilize a structure called a Hopf $G$-triplet for $G$ a group, which generalizes the notion of a Hopf triplet by Chaidez, Cotler, and Cui. In our construction, we present flat bundles over 4-manifolds using colored trisection diagrams: a direct analogue of colored Heegaard diagrams as described by Virelizier. Our main result is that involutory Hopf $G$-triplets of finite type yield well-defined invariants of $G$-colored trisection diagrams, and that if the monodromy of a flat bundle has image in $G$ we obtain invariants of flat bundles. We also show that a special Hopf $G$-triplet yields the invariant from Hopf $G$-algebras described by Mochida, thus generalizing the construction.</description>

Abstract: We construct the most general equilibrium partition function for Newton-Cartan membranes of codimension-1 defined on a flat ambient Newton-Cartan spacetime at second order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. We find the equilibrium constraints and the corresponding set of equilibrium constitutive relations. We show the explicit form of the Young-Laplace equation for a subset of non-vanishing and non-constant transport coefficients in the presence of a rotating fluid background with a constant vorticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pinpoint the spectral decomposition for the Anderson tight-binding model with an unbounded random potential on the Bethe lattice of sufficiently large degree. We prove that there exist a finite number of mobility edges separating intervals of pure-point spectrum from intervals of absolutely continuous spectrum, confirming a prediction of Abou-Chacra, Thouless, and Anderson. A central component of our proof is a monotonicity result for the leading eigenvalue of a certain transfer operator, which governs the decay rate of fractional moments for the tight-binding model's off-diagonal resolvent entries.</description>

      <title>Energy Conditions and Stability of Charged Wormholes in $f(R, \mathscr{L}_m)$ Gravity: A Comparative Analysis with Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the energy conditions of charged traversable wormholes in the framework of $f(R, \mathscr{L}_m)$
  modified gravity. In the first case, we derive the shape functions (SFs) for two different choices of the charge function $\mathcal{E}^2$ by considering the Exponential Spheroid (ES) model and analyze the null energy condition (NEC). In the second case, we consider a particular shape function and study its implications for the energy conditions. In both cases, we obtain expressions for energy density and pressure in radial and tangential directions. Our findings show that the radial NEC remains satisfied across a wide range of charge parameters $\mathcal{E}$ consistent with established physical laws. However, the tangential NEC is only sustained in the range $0.1 \leq \mathcal{E} \leq 0.6$; for higher charge values, violations occur, indicating the formation of a throat-like structure necessary for wormhole stability. Additionally, we compare the pressure-density profiles of these charged wormholes with those of compact objects such as neutron stars, revealing distinct variations in matter distribution. This analysis highlights the crucial role of charge and modified gravity in determining the stability and physical characteristics of wormhole structures.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the weighted Bergman kernel on a complex domain with a weight of the form $\rho=e^{-\alpha\phi}\mu g$, where $\alpha$ is a positive real number, $\phi$ is a K\"ahler potential, g is the determinant of the corresponding K\"ahler metric and $\mu$ is a real-valued positive function. Several $\star$-products related to the Bergman kernel are determined. Explicit formulas are provided up to first order.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions to the system $u_{tt}-u_{xx}+q(x)u=0, x&gt;0,t&gt;0$; $u|_{t=0}=u_t|_{t=0}=0, x&gt;0$; $u|_{x=0}=g(t), t&gt;0$, with a locally summable Hermitian matrix-valued potential $q$ and a $C^{\infty}$-smooth $\mathbb C^n$-valued boundary control $g$ vanishing near the origin. We prove that the solution $u^{g}(\cdot,T)$ is a function from $W^2_1([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$ and that the control operator $W^T:g\mapsto u^g(\cdot,T)$ is an isomorphism in $L_2([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$, and, in the case that $q$ is from $L_2([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$, also an isomorphism in $H^2([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$.</description>

      <title>Conditional Stability of the Euler Method on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive nonlinear stability results for numerical integrators on Riemannian manifolds, by imposing conditions on the ODE vector field and the step size that makes the numerical solution non-expansive whenever the exact solution is non-expansive over the same time step. Our model case is a geodesic version of the explicit Euler method. Precise bounds are obtained in the case of Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. The approach is based on a cocoercivity property of the vector field adapted to manifolds from Euclidean space. It allows us to compare the new results to the corresponding well-known results in flat spaces, and in general we find that a non-zero curvature will deteriorate the stability region of the geodesic Euler method. The step size bounds depend on the distance traveled over a step from the initial point. Numerical examples for spheres and hyperbolic 2-space confirm that the bounds are tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directed landscape, the central object in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, is shown to be the scaling limit of various models by Dauvergne and Vir\'ag (2022) and Dauvergne, Ortmann and Vir\'ag (2018). In his study of geodesics in upper tail deviations of the directed landscape, Liu (2022) put forward a conjecture about the rate of the lowest rate metric under which a geodesic between two points passes through a particular point between them. Das, Dauvergne and Vir\'ag (2024) disproved his conjecture, and made a conjecture of their own. This paper disproves that conjecture and puts the question to rest with an answer and a proof.</description>

      <title>Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two centuries and more particularly in the last decades, the geometry of foams has become an important research domain, in mathematics, physics, material sciences and biology. Most of the simplest geometrical observations of bubble clusters have long resisted rigorous mathematical proofs. Geometries can even get more complicated if immiscible fluids are considered. Although they have to fulfill Plateau's laws like soap bubble clusters if the surface tensions are close to unity, this is not the case in general. In 1996, Frederick J. Almgren asked whether there is "any stable cluster of bubbles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with some bubble being topologically a torus". We propose to answer the latter numerically with simple numerical examples. We build stable soap bubble clusters with a triple torus bubble, a fivefold torus bubble or an elevenfold torus bubble. The construction uses the geometry of a simple immiscible fluids cluster with a torus bubble.</description>

      <title>Flow equation approach to singular stochastic PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove universality of a macroscopic behavior of solutions of a large class of semi-linear parabolic SPDEs on $\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{T}$ with fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$, additive noise and polynomial non-linearity, where $\mathbb{T}$ is the $d$-dimensional torus. We consider the weakly non-linear regime and not necessarily Gaussian noises which are stationary, centered, sufficiently regular and satisfy some integrability and mixing conditions. We prove that the macroscopic scaling limit exists and has a universal law characterized by parameters of the relevant perturbations of the linear equation. We develop a new solution theory for singular SPDEs of the above-mentioned form using the Wilsonian renormalization group theory and the Polchinski flow equation. In particular, in the case of $d=4$ and the cubic non-linearity our analysis covers the whole sub-critical regime $\sigma&gt;2$. Our technique avoids completely all the algebraic and combinatorial problems arising in different approaches.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general approximate quantization rule $ \int_{L_{E}}^{R_{E}}k_0(x)$ $dx=(N+\frac{1}{2})\pi $ or $ \oint k_0(x)$ $dx=(2N+1)\pi $ (including both forward and backward processes) for the bound states in the potential well of the $n$th-order Schr\"{o}dinger equations $ e^{-i\pi n/2}{{}\frac{d^n\Psi(x)}{d x^n} } =[E-{} V(x)]\Psi(x) ,$ where ${} k_0(x)=(E-V(x) )^{1/n}$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}_{0} $, $n$ is an even natural number, and $L_{E}$ and $R_{E}$ the boundary points between the classically forbidden regions and the allowed region. The only hypothesis is that all exponentially growing components are negligible, which is appropriate for not narrow wells. Applications including the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Order $p$ quantum Wasserstein distances from couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport provides a powerful mathematical framework with applications spanning numerous fields. A cornerstone within this domain is the $p$-Wasserstein distance, which serves to quantify the cost of transporting one probability measure to another. While recent attempts have sought to extend this measure to the realm of quantum states, existing definitions often present certain limitations, such as not being faithful. In this work, we present a new definition of quantum Wasserstein distances. This definition, leveraging the coupling method and a metric applicable to pure states, draws inspiration from a property characterising the classical Wasserstein distance - its determination based on its value on point masses. Subject to certain continuity properties, our definition exhibits numerous attributes expected of an optimal quantum rendition of the Wasserstein distance. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates metrics familiar to quantum information theory, such as the trace distance. Moreover, it provides an organic extension for metrics, like Nielsen's complexity metric, allowing their application to mixed states with a natural operational interpretation. Furthermore, we analyze this metric's attributes in the context of random quantum states and unveil phase transitions concerning the complexity of subsystems of random states.</description>

      <title>Stationary Measure of the Open KPZ Equation through the Enaud-Derrida Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works of Barraquand and Le Doussal and Bryc, Kuznetsov, Wang, and Wesolowski gave a description of the open KPZ stationary measure as the sum of a Brownian motion and a Brownian motion reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequent work of Barraquand and Le Doussal used the Enaud-Derrida representation of the DEHP algebra to formulate the open ASEP stationary measure in terms of the sum of a random walk and a random walk reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. They show that this Radon-Nikodym derivative converges pointwise to the Radon-Nikodym derivative that characterizes the open KPZ stationary measure. This article proves that the corresponding sequence of measures converges weakly to the open KPZ stationary measure. This provides an alternative proof of the probabilistic formulation of the open KPZ stationary measure, which avoids dealing explicitly with finite dimensional distributions. We also provide the first construction of the measure on intervals of a general length and for the full range of parameters in the fan region $(u+v&gt;0)$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Responses of any arbitrary initially stressed reference and the stress-free reference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constitutive relation for an initially stressed reference is often determined by using the response of a virtual stress-free reference. However, identifying the constitutive relation of the original stress-free body can be challenging without conducting destructive tests. This paper presents three approaches for determining the response of a stress-free reference -- or any arbitrary initially stressed reference -- when the response of a particular initially stressed reference is known. Unlike standard practice, these approaches of changing reference configurations do not begin with a known stress-free state. The first and third approaches directly derive the constitutive relations of one stressed reference from another. {The first approach is applicable to a specific constitutive relation of the known initially stressed state,} while the third approach extends the first and is applicable to any constitutive form. The second approach uses any general response of a given stressed reference to identify the stress-free material. The response of the stress-free material is further analyzed and processed to determine the response of any stressed reference. We observe that even when the known initially stressed state is Green elastic, the arbitrarily stressed or stress-free references may exhibit implicit elasticity.

      <title>Statistical Virtual Temperature of Classical and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a foundational definition of statistical virtual temperature, derived from the spectrum of the Gibbs Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and formulated using d-1 indices of purity (IP), where d represents the Hilbert space dimension within the C*-algebra framework. We demonstrate that the universal physical bounds between von Neumann entropy and statistical virtual temperature are constrained by these IPs, which may offer broader applications to quantum systems. Additionally, we geometrize classical optical polarization states of an arbitrary electromagnetic field and provide an interpretation of the quantum Mpemba effect, where a quantum system prepared at a higher statistical virtual temperature relaxes to equilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. This behavior is explained through a novel concept of temperature-resolved entanglement asymmetry. Additionally, we present a geometric interpretation of the third law of thermodynamics using these entropy-temperature diagrams. Nevertheless, the defined statistical virtual temperature inherently exhibits the third law of thermodynamics. We believe that this work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of classical polarization theory, quantum information theory, and quantum thermodynamics, and it may establish new connections and insights into these fields.</description>

      <title>On Chalykh's approach to eigenfunctions of DIM-induced integrable Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quite some years ago, Oleg Chalykh has built a nice theory from the observation that the Macdonald polynomial reduces at $t=q^{-m}$ to a sum over permutations of simpler polynomials called Baker-Akhiezer functions, which can be unambiguously constructed from a system of linear difference equations. Moreover, he also proposed a generalization of these polynomials to the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions. Recently, in a private communication Oleg suggested that these twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions could provide eigenfunctions of the commuting Hamiltonians associated with the $(-1,a)$ rays of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra. In the paper, we discuss this suggestion and some evidence in its support.</description>

Abstract: We found two stationary solutions of the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinear term proportional to $|\psi(x,t)|^{2 \kappa} \psi(x,t)$ for positive values of $\kappa$. By linearizing the equation around these exact solutions, we derive the corresponding Sturm-Liouville problem. Our analysis reveals that one of the stationary solutions is unstable, while the stability of the other solution depends on the amplitude of the parametric force, damping coefficient, and nonlinearity parameter $\kappa$. An exceptional change of variables facilitates the computation of the stability diagram through numerical solutions of the eigenvalue problem as a specific parameter $\varepsilon$ varies within a bounded interval. For $\kappa &lt;2$ , an {\it oscillatory instability} is predicted analytically and confirmed numerically. Our principal result establishes that for $\kappa \ge 2$, there exists a critical value of $\varepsilon$ beyond which the unstable soliton becomes stable, exhibiting {\it oscillatory stability}.</description>

      <title>Finite-time quantum equilibration for continuous variables</title>

Abstract: Leveraging the techniques found in the literature on Quantum Equilibration for finite dimensional systems, we develop the theory of Quantum Equilibration for the case of infinite-dimensional systems, particularly the cases where the dynamics-generating Hamiltonians have continuous spectrum. The main goal of this paper will be to propose a framework to extend the results obtained by Short in, where estimates for the equilibration-on-average and effective equilibration for the case of Hamiltonians with continuous spectrum are derived. We will show that in the latter setting, it is compulsory to constrain ourselves to finite time equilibration; we then develop estimates analogous to the main results in the proposed setting.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16587</link>

Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Specifically, we examine the simplest scenario in which the scalar field lacks a kinetic term, and its kinetic contribution arises from an integration by parts of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes, focusing on Bianchi I and extended Bianchi I geometries. Our study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetimes where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropic configurations where all scale factors evolve identically. Additionally, we discuss the effects of a cosmological constant, finding that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe.</description>
