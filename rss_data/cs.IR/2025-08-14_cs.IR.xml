      <title>Bridging Modality Gaps in e-Commerce Products via Vision-Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Item information, such as titles and attributes, is essential for effective user engagement in e-commerce. However, manual or semi-manual entry of structured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow turnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate descriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing retrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss fine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.
  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for generating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key challenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality gaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data refinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures alignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual Understanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained information from visual inputs.
  OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference optimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving robustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on real-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates. These results demonstrate that OPAL effectively bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities, delivering richer, more accurate, and more consistent item descriptions. This work advances automated listing optimization and supports scalable, high-quality content generation in e-commerce platforms.</description>

      <title>DS4RS: Community-Driven and Explainable Dataset Search Engine for Recommender System Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing suitable datasets is critical for research and development in recommender systems. However, finding datasets that match specific recommendation task or domains remains a challenge due to scattered sources and inconsistent metadata. To address this gap, we propose a community-driven and explainable dataset search engine tailored for recommender system research. Our system supports semantic search across multiple dataset attributes, such as dataset names, descriptions, and recommendation domain, and provides explanations of search relevance to enhance transparency. The system encourages community participation by allowing users to contribute standardized dataset metadata in public repository. By improving dataset discoverability and search interpretability, the system facilitates more efficient research reproduction. The platform is publicly available at: https://ds4rs.com.</description>

      <title>Clicks Versus Conversion: Choosing a Recommender's Training Objective in E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate (CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature importances for each of the objectives.</description>

      <title>Proxy Model-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Client Selection in Federated Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommender systems have emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm, enabling personalized recommendation services without exposing users' raw data. By keeping data local and relying on a central server to coordinate training across distributed clients, FedRSs protect user privacy while collaboratively learning global models. However, most existing FedRS frameworks adopt fully random client selection strategy in each training round, overlooking the statistical heterogeneity of user data arising from diverse preferences and behavior patterns, thereby resulting in suboptimal model performance. While some client selection strategies have been proposed in the broader federated learning literature, these methods are typically designed for generic tasks and fail to address the unique challenges of recommendation scenarios, such as expensive contribution evaluation due to the large number of clients, and sparse updates resulting from long-tail item distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose ProxyRL-FRS, a proxy model-guided reinforcement learning framework tailored for client selection in federated recommendation. Specifically, we first introduce ProxyNCF, a dual-branch model deployed on each client, which augments standard Neural Collaborative Filtering with an additional proxy model branch that provides lightweight contribution estimation, thus eliminating the need for expensive per-round local training traditionally required to evaluate a client's contribution. Furthermore, we design a staleness-aware SA reinforcement learning agent that selects clients based on the proxy-estimated contribution, and is guided by a reward function balancing recommendation accuracy and embedding staleness, thereby enriching the update coverage of item embeddings. Experiments conducted on public recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ProxyRL-FRS.</description>

      <title>Semantic IDs for Joint Generative Search and Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a unified solution for powering both recommendation and search tasks. A key design choice in these models is how to represent items, traditionally through unique identifiers (IDs) and more recently with Semantic IDs composed of discrete codes, obtained from embeddings. While task-specific embedding models can improve performance for individual tasks, they may not generalize well in a joint setting. In this paper, we explore how to construct Semantic IDs that perform well both in search and recommendation when using a unified model. We compare a range of strategies to construct Semantic IDs, looking into task-specific and cross-tasks approaches, and also whether each task should have its own semantic ID tokens in a joint search and recommendation generative model. Our results show that using a bi-encoder model fine-tuned on both search and recommendation tasks to obtain item embeddings, followed by the construction of a unified Semantic ID space provides an effective trade-off, enabling strong performance in both tasks. We hope these findings spark follow-up work on generalisable, semantically grounded ID schemes and inform the next wave of unified generative recommender architectures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Patent Searching Using Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding relevant prior art is crucial when deciding whether to file a new patent application or invalidate an existing patent. However, searching for prior art is challenging due to the large number of patent documents and the need for nuanced comparisons to determine novelty. An accurate search engine is therefore invaluable for speeding up the process. We present a Graph Transformer-based dense retrieval method for patent searching where each invention is represented by a graph describing its features and their relationships. Our model processes these invention graphs and is trained using prior art citations from patent office examiners as relevance signals. Using graphs as input significantly improves the computational efficiency of processing long documents, while leveraging examiner citations allows the model to learn domain-specific similarities beyond simple text-based matching. The result is a search engine that emulates how professional patent examiners identify relevant documents. We compare our approach against publicly available text embedding models and show substantial improvements in both prior art retrieval quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>DAS: Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs Empowered Industrial Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic IDs are discrete identifiers generated by quantizing the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) embeddings, enabling efficient multi-modal content integration in recommendation systems. However, their lack of collaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative and generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced various alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage framework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable information loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive alignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information maximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method that simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic integrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically associated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient alignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the following two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative Alignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and collaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and then design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item (u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual quantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads achieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully deployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400 million users daily.</description>

      <title>FuXi-\beta: Towards a Lightweight and Fast Large-Scale Generative Recommendation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws for autoregressive generative recommenders reveal potential for larger, more versatile systems but mean greater latency and training costs. To accelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative recommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\alpha$, identifying two efficiency bottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and the computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that relative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as attention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative forms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the question of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical experiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade the model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation models. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which avoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias, thereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key attention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new Attention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to FuXi-$\alpha$, we introduce a new model, FuXi-$\beta$. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\beta$ outperforms previous state-of-the-art models and achieves significant acceleration compared to FuXi-$\alpha$, while also adhering to the scaling law. Notably, FuXi-$\beta$ shows an improvement of 27% to 47% in the NDCG@10 metric on large-scale industrial datasets compared to FuXi-$\alpha$. Our code is available in a public repository: https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/FuXi-beta</description>

      <title>Hypercomplex Prompt-aware Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems face critical challenges in handling information overload while addressing the inherent limitations of multimodal representation learning. Existing methods suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1) restricted ability to represent rich multimodal features through a single representation, (2) existing linear modality fusion strategies ignore the deep nonlinear correlations between modalities, and (3) static optimization methods failing to dynamically mitigate the over-smoothing problem in graph convolutional network (GCN). To overcome these limitations, we propose HPMRec, a novel Hypercomplex Prompt-aware Multimodal Recommendation framework, which utilizes hypercomplex embeddings in the form of multi-components to enhance the representation diversity of multimodal features. HPMRec adopts the hypercomplex multiplication to naturally establish nonlinear cross-modality interactions to bridge semantic gaps, which is beneficial to explore the cross-modality features. HPMRec also introduces the prompt-aware compensation mechanism to aid the misalignment between components and modality-specific features loss, and this mechanism fundamentally alleviates the over-smoothing problem. It further designs self-supervised learning tasks that enhance representation diversity and align different modalities. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that HPMRec achieves state-of-the-art recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>CrossDenoise: Denoising Implicit Feedback via a Lightweight Entity-Aware Synergistic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling, suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.</description>

      <title>User Perception of Attention Visualizations: Effects on Interpretability Across Evidence-Based Medical Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture. Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features (e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However, there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how they are visually presented.</description>

      <title>RTTC: Reward-Guided Collaborative Test-Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary. To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching, which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable, high-performance language model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Reflect then Learn: Active Prompting for Information Extraction Guided by Introspective Confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty (inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained, dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and reliable structured generation systems.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level code completion systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Plant Species Prediction with Metadata-Enhanced Multi-Head Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift. Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base (ViT-B/14) backbone with multiple classification heads for species, genus, and family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts, top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies. Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making our submission 3rd best on the private leaderboard. Our code is available at https://github.com/geranium12/plant-clef-2025/tree/v1.0.0.</description>

      <title>Confounding is a Pervasive Problem in Real World Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.</description>

      <title>STEP: Stepwise Curriculum Learning for Context-Knowledge Fusion in Conversational Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items. To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content, which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Collaborative Filtering with FourierKAN Feature Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF) has emerged as a dominant paradigm in modern recommendation systems, excelling at modeling complex user-item interactions and capturing high-order collaborative signals through graph-structured learning. Most existing GCF models predominantly rely on simplified graph architectures like LightGCN, which strategically remove feature transformation and activation functions from vanilla graph convolution networks. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that feature transformation in message propagation can enhance model representation, though at the cost of increased training difficulty. To this end, we propose FourierKAN-GCF, a novel GCN framework that adopts Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks as efficient transformation modules within graph propagation layers. This design enhances model representation while decreasing training difficulty. Our FourierKAN-GCF can achieve higher recommendation performance than most widely used GCF backbone models. In addition, it can be integrated into existing advanced self-supervised models as a backbone, replacing their original backbone to achieve enhanced performance. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of FourierKAN-GCF.</description>

      <title>A New Query Expansion Approach via Agent-Mediated Dialogic Inquiry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query expansion is widely used in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve search outcomes by supplementing initial queries with richer information. While recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield homogeneous, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve relevant information. In this paper, we propose AMD: a new Agent-Mediated Dialogic Framework that engages in a dialogic inquiry involving three specialized roles: (1) a Socratic Questioning Agent reformulates the initial query into three sub-questions, with each question inspired by a specific Socratic questioning dimension, including clarification, assumption probing, and implication probing, (2) a Dialogic Answering Agent generates pseudo-answers, enriching the query representation with multiple perspectives aligned to the user's intent, and (3) a Reflective Feedback Agent evaluates and refines these pseudo-answers, ensuring that only the most relevant and informative content is retained. By leveraging a multi-agent process, AMD effectively crafts richer query representations through inquiry and feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including BEIR and TREC demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods, offering a robust solution for retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>FinSage: A Multi-aspect RAG System for Financial Filings Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Relevance Judgments in Legal Case Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining which legal cases are relevant to a given query involves navigating lengthy texts and applying nuanced legal reasoning. Traditionally, this task has demanded significant time and domain expertise to identify key Legal Facts and reach sound juridical conclusions. In addition, existing data with legal case similarities often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind relevance judgments. With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential in this domain. Nonetheless, the method of employing a general large language model for reliable relevance judgments in legal case retrieval remains largely unexplored. To address this gap in research, we propose a novel few-shot approach where LLMs assist in generating expert-aligned interpretable relevance judgments. The proposed approach decomposes the judgment process into several stages, mimicking the workflow of human annotators and allowing for the flexible incorporation of expert reasoning to improve the accuracy of relevance judgments. Importantly, it also ensures interpretable data labeling, providing transparency and clarity in the relevance assessment process. Through a comparison of relevance judgments made by LLMs and human experts, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield reliable and valid relevance assessments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with minimal expert supervision, our approach enables a large language model to acquire case analysis expertise and subsequently transfers this ability to a smaller model via annotation-based knowledge distillation.</description>

      <title>Delayed Feedback Modeling with Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In online advertising under the cost-per-conversion (CPA) model, accurate conversion rate (CVR) prediction is crucial. A major challenge is delayed feedback, where conversions may occur long after user interactions, leading to incomplete recent data and biased model training. Existing solutions partially mitigate this issue but often rely on auxiliary models, making them computationally inefficient and less adaptive to user interest shifts. We propose IF-DFM, an \underline{I}nfluence \underline{F}unction-empowered for \underline{D}elayed \underline{F}eedback \underline{M}odeling which estimates the impact of newly arrived and delayed conversions on model parameters, enabling efficient updates without full retraining. By reformulating the inverse Hessian-vector product as an optimization problem, IF-DFM achieves a favorable trade-off between scalability and effectiveness. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that IF-DFM outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

      <title>MMRAG-DocQA: A Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Method for Document Question-Answering with Hierarchical Index and Multi-Granularity Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-modal long-context document question-answering task aims to locate and integrate multi-modal evidences (such as texts, tables, charts, images, and layouts) distributed across multiple pages, for question understanding and answer generation. The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MMRAG-DocQA method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</description>
