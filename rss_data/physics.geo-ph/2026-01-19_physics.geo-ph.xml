      <title>High-resolution measurement of sea ice mechanical characteristics using Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice mechanical properties are involved in dynamical processes acting from the scale of meters to several hundred kilometers. The current rapid changes in the state of polar sea ice require a better understanding and modeling of these processes and, therefore, accurate measurements of properties including sea ice thickness, density, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. These properties can be measured by tracking the propagation of elastic waves within the ice. Recent technological advances have enabled the use of fiber-optic cables as cost-effective, dense seismic arrays. Once connected to an interrogator unit and mechanically coupled to a medium, here the ice cover, these cables can monitor strain field propagation, using a technique called Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). In this work, we describe the use of such an array of sensors in the coastal ice of the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, where a 600 m long optical fiber was deployed across three different morphological sea ice conditions. During hour-long recordings, we measured the propagation of both multi-modal seismic signals generated by active sources and hydro-elastic swell. We computed dispersion curves of active signals and used Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to observe the evolution of swell characteristics in the different ice areas. The dispersion curves were successfully inverted to measure the spatial evolution of ice thickness, and Young's and flexural rigidity in each of these areas. We observed ice thicknesses from 25 cm to 68 cm and Young's modulus values between 4.5 GPa and 5.7 GPa, in good agreement with values derived from collocated geophone arrays and drill hole thickness measurements. DAS systems therefore appear to be effective in evaluating heterogeneous sea ice mechanical properties and thus sea ice formation history and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mountain resonance shapes the distribution of earthquake-induced landslides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake-induced landslides are among the most destructive cascading hazards, yet the physical mechanisms governing their spatial distribution and size remain incompletely understood. While amplification of seismic waves by local topography is well documented, the role of mountain-scale resonance has remained largely untested. Here we demonstrate that the resonant frequency of mountains exerts a statistically significant control on the occurrence, spatial pattern, and size of coseismic landslides. Using the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, which triggered more than 25,000 landslides, we combine three-dimensional modal analysis of 3,130 mountain bodies with a high-resolution landslide inventory. Landslides preferentially occur on mountains whose resonant frequencies (0.5-1.2 Hz) overlap with the dominant frequency content of the earthquake. Mountains affected by landslides exhibit systematically lower resonant frequencies than stable mountains, and larger landslides are associated with lower-frequency mountains. These findings provide quantitative evidence that mountain-scale resonance amplifies seismic ground motion sufficiently to influence landslide triggering, highlighting an overlooked mechanism that should be incorporated into assessments of earthquake-induced landslide hazard.</description>

      <title>3D latent diffusion models for parameterizing and history matching multiscenario facies systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geological parameterization procedures entail the mapping of a high-dimensional geomodel to a low-dimensional latent variable. These parameterizations can be very useful for history matching because the number of variables to be calibrated is greatly reduced, and the mapping can be constructed such that geological realism is automatically preserved. In this work, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models (LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable scenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and channel width, are considered. A perceptual loss term is included during training to improve geological realism. For any set of scenario parameters, an (essentially) infinite number of realizations can be generated, so our LDM parameterizes over a very wide model space. New realizations constructed using the LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both visually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response distributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also shown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models. The parameterization method is applied for ensemble-based history matching, with model updates performed in the LDM latent space, for cases involving geological scenario uncertainty. For three synthetic true models corresponding to different geological scenarios, we observe clear uncertainty reduction in both production forecasts and geological scenario parameters. The overall method is additionally shown to provide posterior geomodels consistent with the synthetic true model in each case.</description>
