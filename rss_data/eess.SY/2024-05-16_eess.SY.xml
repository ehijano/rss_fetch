      <title>Improving Sequential Market Clearing via Value-oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) brings huge uncertainty into the electricity markets. While existing deterministic market clearing fails to accommodate the uncertainty, the recently proposed stochastic market clearing struggles to achieve desirable market properties. In this work, we propose a value-oriented forecasting approach, which tactically determines the RESs generation that enters the day-ahead market. With such a forecast, the existing deterministic market clearing framework can be maintained, and the day-ahead and real-time overall operation cost is reduced. At the training phase, the forecast model parameters are estimated to minimize expected day-ahead and real-time overall operation costs, instead of minimizing forecast errors in a statistical sense. Theoretically, we derive the exact form of the loss function for training the forecast model that aligns with such a goal. For market clearing modeled by linear programs, this loss function is a piecewise linear function. Additionally, we derive the analytical gradient of the loss function with respect to the forecast, which inspires an efficient training strategy. A numerical study shows our forecasts can bring significant benefits of the overall cost reduction to deterministic market clearing, compared to quality-oriented forecasting approach.</description>

      <title>IoT-enabled Stability Chamber for the Pharmaceutical Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stability chamber is a critical piece of equipment for any pharmaceutical facility to retain the manufactured product for testing the stability and quality of the products over a certain period of time by keeping the products in different sets of environmental conditions. In this paper, we proposed an IoT-enabled stability chamber for the pharmaceutical industry. We developed four stability chambers by using the existing utilities of a manufacturing facility. The state-of-the-art automatic PID controlling system of Siemens S7-1200 PLC was used to control each chamber. Seven precise temperature and humidity sensors were used to monitor the environment of each chamber. PC-based Siemens WinCC Runtime Advanced visualization platform was used to visualize the data of the chamber which is FDA 21 CFR Part 11 Compliant. Sensor data of the chamber are stored in the database in a periodic manner and also have report generation features. This chamber also has an alarm management system. The critical alarms are automatically emailed to the user to take action. Additionally, an Internet of Things-based (IoT-based) application was also developed to monitor the sensor's data remotely using any client application.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Design Optimization of Looped Water Distribution Networks using MS Excel: Developing the Open-Source X-WHAT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cost-effective water distribution network (WDN) design with acceptable pressure performance is crucial for the management of drinking water in cities. This paper presents a Microsoft Excel tool to model, simulate, and optimize WDNs with looped pipelines under steady-state incompressible flow simulations. Typically, the hardy-cross method is applied using spreadsheet calculations to estimate discharges. This method requires mass-conservative initial estimates and requires successive iterations to converge. In this paper, however, we develop an alternative method that uses the built-in solver capabilities of Excel, does not require initial mass-conservative estimation, and is free of flow corrections. The main objective of this paper is to develop an open-source accessible tool for simulating hydraulic networks also adapted for teaching and learning purposes. The governing equations and the mathematical basis for the hydraulic modeling of the system are mathematically described, considering the topology of the network, mass and energy conservation, cost of tank material, foundation, and cost of pumping energy to fill the tank. The use of this tool is encouraged at the undergraduate and graduate engineering levels, as it offers the opportunity to address complex concepts in a comprehensive way using a spreadsheet that does not require coding expertise. Hence, users can debug all cells and understand all equations used in the hydraulic model, as well as modify them. To demonstrate the model capabilities, three practical examples are presented, with the first one solved step by step, and the results are compared with the EPANET and with the results reported in the literature. Using the optimization method presented in this paper, it was possible to achieve a cost reduction of 151,790 USD (9.8% of the total cost) in a network that supplies a 44,416 population.</description>

      <title>DVS-RG: Differential Variable Speed Limits Control using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Graph State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable speed limit (VSL) control is an established yet challenging problem to improve freeway traffic mobility and alleviate bottlenecks by customizing speed limits at proper locations based on traffic conditions. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have shown promising results in solving VSL control problems by interacting with sophisticated environments. However, the modeling of these methods ignores the inherent graph structure of the traffic state which can be a key factor for more efficient VSL control. Graph structure can not only capture the static spatial feature but also the dynamic temporal features of traffic. Therefore, we propose the DVS-RG: DRL-based differential variable speed limit controller with graph state representation. DVS-RG provides distinct speed limits per lane in different locations dynamically. The road network topology and traffic information(e.g., occupancy, speed) are integrated as the state space of DVS-RG so that the spatial features can be learned. The normalization reward which combines efficiency and safety is used to train the VSL controller to avoid excessive inefficiencies or low safety. The results obtained from the simulation study on SUMO show that DRL-RG achieves higher traffic efficiency (the average waiting time reduced to 68.44\%) and improves the safety measures (the number of potential collision reduced by 15.93\% ) compared to state-of-the-art DRL methods.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Cooperative Levels of Multiple-Heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multiple and heterogenous unmanned vehicle systems continue to play an increasingly important role in addressing complex missions in the real world, the need for effective cooperation among unmanned vehicles becomes paramount. The concept of autonomous cooperation, wherein unmanned vehicles cooperate without human intervention or human control, offers promising avenues for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of intelligence of multiple-heterogeneous unmanned vehicle systems. Despite the growing interests in this domain, as far as the authors are concerned, there exists a notable lack of comprehensive literature on defining explicit concept and classifying levels of autonomous cooperation of multiple-heterogeneous unmanned vehicle systems. In this aspect, this article aims to define the explicit concept of autonomous cooperation of multiple-heterogeneous unmanned vehicle systems. Furthermore, we provide a novel criterion to assess the technical maturity of the developed unmanned vehicle systems by classifying the autonomous cooperative levels of multiple-heterogeneous unmanned vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Controllability Test for Nonlinear Datatic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental property of control systems, serving as the prerequisite for controller design. While controllability test is well established in modelic (i.e., model-driven) control systems, extending it to datatic (i.e., data-driven) control systems is still a challenging task due to the absence of system models. In this study, we propose a general controllability test method for nonlinear systems with datatic description, where the system behaviors are merely described by data. In this situation, the state transition information of a dynamic system is available only at a limited number of data points, leaving the behaviors beyond these points unknown. Different from traditional exact controllability, we introduce a new concept called $\epsilon$-controllability, which extends the definition from point-to-point form to point-to-region form. Accordingly, our focus shifts to checking whether the system state can be steered to a closed state ball centered on the target state, rather than exactly at that target state. On its basis, we propose a tree search algorithm called maximum expansion of controllable subset (MECS) to identify controllable states in the dataset. Starting with a specific target state, our algorithm can iteratively propagate controllability from a known state ball to a new one. This iterative process gradually enlarges the $\epsilon$-controllable subset by incorporating new controllable balls until all $\epsilon$-controllable states are searched. Besides, a simplified version of MECS is proposed by solving a special shortest path problem, called Floyd expansion with radius fixed (FERF). FERF maintains a fixed radius of all controllable balls based on a mutual controllability assumption of neighboring states. The effectiveness of our method is validated in three datatic control systems whose dynamic behaviors are described by sampled data.</description>

      <title>On identifying the non-linear dynamics of a hovercraft using an end-to-end deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the identification of the non-linear dynamics of a novel hovercraft design, employing end-to-end deep learning techniques. Our experimental setup consists of a hovercraft propelled by racing drone propellers mounted on a lightweight foam base, allowing it to float and be controlled freely on an air hockey table. We learn parametrized physics-inspired non-linear models directly from data trajectories, leveraging gradient-based optimization techniques prevalent in machine learning research. The chosen model structure allows us to control the position of the hovercraft precisely on the air hockey table. We then analyze the prediction performance and demonstrate the closed-loop control performance on the real system.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Enhancing Queue Sampling for Energy-Efficient Remote Control of Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the integration of communication and control systems has gained significant traction in various domains, ranging from autonomous vehicles to industrial automation and beyond. Multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have proven their effectiveness as a robust framework for solving control problems. In this work, we investigate the use of MAB algorithms to control remote devices, which faces considerable challenges primarily represented by latency and reliability. We analyze the effectiveness of MABs operating in environments where the action feedback from controlled devices is transmitted over an unreliable communication channel and stored in a Geo/Geo/1 queue. We investigate the impact of queue sampling strategies on the MAB performance, and introduce a new stochastic approach. Its performance in terms of regret is evaluated against established algorithms in the literature for both upper confidence bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithms. Additionally, we study the trade-off between maximizing rewards and minimizing energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Integrators Chain Control via Barrier Function Adaptation and Lyapunov Redesign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyapunov redesign is a classical technique that uses a nominal control and its corresponding nominal Lyapunov function to design a discontinuous control, such that it compensates the uncertainties and disturbances. In this paper, the idea of Lyapunov redesign is used to propose an adaptive time-varying gain controller to stabilize a class of perturbed chain of integrators with an unknown control coefficient. It is assumed that the upper bound of the perturbation exists but is unknown. A proportional navigation feedback type gain is used to drive the system's trajectories into a prescribed vicinity of the origin in a predefined time, measured using a quadratic Lyapunov function. Once this neighborhood is reached, a barrier function-based gain is used, ensuring that the system's trajectories never leave this neighborhood despite uncertainties and perturbations. Experimental validation of the proposed controller in Furuta's pendulum is presented.</description>

      <title>Joint Instantaneous Amplitude-Frequency Analysis of Vibration Signals for Vibration-Based Condition Monitoring of Rolling Bearings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrations of damaged bearings are manifested as modulations in the amplitude of the generated vibration signal, making envelope analysis an effective approach for discriminating between healthy and abnormal vibration patterns. Motivated by this, we introduce a low-complexity method for vibration-based condition monitoring (VBCM) of rolling bearings based on envelope analysis. In the proposed method, the instantaneous amplitude (envelope) and instantaneous frequency of the vibration signal are jointly utilized to facilitate three novel envelope representations: instantaneous amplitude-frequency mapping (IAFM), instantaneous amplitude-frequency correlation (IAFC), and instantaneous energy-frequency distribution (IEFD). Maintaining temporal information, these representations effectively capture energy-frequency variations that are unique to the condition of the bearing, thereby enabling the extraction of discriminative features with high sensitivity to variations in operational conditions. Accordingly, six new highly discriminative features are engineered from these representations, capturing and characterizing their shapes. The experimental results show outstanding performance in detecting and diagnosing various fault types, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing unique variations in energy and frequency between healthy and faulty bearings. Moreover, the proposed method has moderate computational complexity, meeting the requirements of real-time applications. Further, the Python code of the proposed method is made public to support collaborative research efforts and ensure the reproducibility of the presented work</description>

      <title>Slice-aware Resource Allocation and Admission Control for Smart Factory Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) and beyond network offers substantial promise as the ideal wireless technology to replace the existing inflexible wired connections in traditional factories of today. 5G network slicing allows for tailored allocation of resources to different network services, each with unique Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a novel solution for slice-aware radio resource allocation based on a convex optimisation control framework for applications in smart factory wireless networks. The proposed framework dynamically allocates minimum power and sub-channels to downlink mixed service type industrial users categorised into three slices: Capacity Limited (CL), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Time Sensitive (TS) slices. Given that the base station (BS) has limited transmission power, we enforce admission control by effectively relaxing the target rate constraints for current connections in the CL slice. This rate readjustment occurs whenever power consumption exceeds manageable levels. Simulation results show that our approach minimises power, allocates sub-channels to users, maintains slice isolation, and delivers QoS-specific communications to users in all the slices despite time-varying number of users and changing network conditions.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Ship Collision Avoidance: Decoding Decision-Making Processes and Behavioral Intentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study developed an explainable AI for ship collision avoidance. Initially, a critic network composed of sub-task critic networks was proposed to individually evaluate each sub-task in collision avoidance to clarify the AI decision-making processes involved. Additionally, an attempt was made to discern behavioral intentions through a Q-value analysis and an Attention mechanism. The former focused on interpreting intentions by examining the increment of the Q-value resulting from AI actions, while the latter incorporated the significance of other ships in the decision-making process for collision avoidance into the learning objective. AI's behavioral intentions in collision avoidance were visualized by combining the perceived collision danger with the degree of attention to other ships. The proposed method was evaluated through a numerical experiment. The developed AI was confirmed to be able to safely avoid collisions under various congestion levels, and AI's decision-making process was rendered comprehensible to humans. The proposed method not only facilitates the understanding of DRL-based controllers/systems in the ship collision avoidance task but also extends to any task comprising sub-tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Koopman Embedding for Robust Control of Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of linear embedding is the key to the synthesis of linear control techniques for nonlinear systems. In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Linear Test for Global Nonlinear Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that if a nonlinear control affine system without drift is bracket generating, then its associated sub-Laplacian is invertible under some conditions on the domain. In this note, we investigate the converse. We show how invertibility of the sub-Laplacian operator implies a weaker form of controllability, where the reachable sets of a neighborhood of a point have full measure. From a computational point of view, one can then use the spectral gap of the (infinite-dimensional) self-adjoint operator to define a notion of degree of controllability.
  An essential tool to establish the converse result is to use the relation between invertibility of the sub-Laplacian to the the controllability of the corresponding continuity equation using possibly non-smooth controls. Then using Ambrosio-Gigli-Savare's superposition principle from optimal transport theory we relate it to controllability properties of the control system. While the proof can be considered of the Perron-Frobenius type, we also provide a second dual Koopman point of view.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of the Iteratively Preconditioned Gradient-Descent (IPG) Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the observer design problem for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with sampled measurement data. Earlier, the recently proposed Iteratively Preconditioned Gradient-Descent (IPG) observer, a Newton-type observer, has been empirically shown to have improved robustness against measurement noise than the prominent nonlinear observers, a property that other Newton-type observers lack. However, no theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the IPG observer were provided. This paper presents a rigorous convergence analysis of the IPG observer for a class of nonlinear systems in deterministic settings, proving its local linear convergence to the actual trajectory. Our assumptions are standard in the existing literature of Newton-type observers, and the analysis further confirms the relation of the IPG observer with the Newton observer, which was only hypothesized earlier.</description>

      <title>An Exact Theory of Causal Emergence for Linear Stochastic Iteration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After coarse-graining a complex system, the dynamics of its macro-state may exhibit more pronounced causal effects than those of its micro-state. This phenomenon, known as causal emergence, is quantified by the indicator of effective information. However, two challenges confront this theory: the absence of well-developed frameworks in continuous stochastic dynamical systems and the reliance on coarse-graining methodologies. In this study, we introduce an exact theoretic framework for causal emergence within linear stochastic iteration systems featuring continuous state spaces and Gaussian noise. Building upon this foundation, we derive an analytical expression for effective information across general dynamics and identify optimal linear coarse-graining strategies that maximize the degree of causal emergence when the dimension averaged uncertainty eliminated by coarse-graining has an upper bound. Our investigation reveals that the maximal causal emergence and the optimal coarse-graining methods are primarily determined by the principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic system's parameter matrix, with the latter not being unique. To validate our propositions, we apply our analytical models to three simplified physical systems, comparing the outcomes with numerical simulations, and consistently achieve congruent results.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Path Planning: Navigating through Rough Mereology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative technique for the path planning of flying robots in a 3D environment in Rough Mereology terms. The main goal was to construct the algorithm that would generate the mereological potential fields in 3-dimensional space. To avoid falling into the local minimum, we assist with a weighted Euclidean distance. Moreover, a searching path from the start point to the target, with respect to avoiding the obstacles was applied. The environment was created by connecting two cameras working in real-time. To determine the gate and elements of the world inside the map was responsible the Python Library OpenCV [1] which recognized shapes and colors. The main purpose of this paper is to apply the given results to drones.</description>

      <title>Full-wave EM simulation analysis of human body blockage by dense 2D antenna arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, proposals of human-sensing-based services for cellular and local area networks have brought indoor localization to the attention of several research groups. In response to these stimuli, various Device-Free Localization (DFL) techniques, also known as Passive Localization methods, have emerged by exploiting ambient signals to locate and track individuals that do not carry any electronic device. This study delves into human passive indoor localization through full-wave electromagnetic simulations. For the scope, we exploit simulations from the commercial tool FEKO software that employs the Method of Moments (MoM). In particular, we collect and analyze the electric field values in a scenario constituted by a dense 2D/3D deployment of receivers in the presence of an anthropomorphic mobile target. The paper describes in detail the collected dataset and provides a first analysis based on a statistical approach. Possible use cases are also investigated through examples in the context of passive localization, sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the antenna radiation patterns in passive radio sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) body models based on the scalar diffraction theory allow to predict the impact of subject motions on the radio propagation channel without requiring a time-consuming full-wave approach. On the other hand, they are less effective in complex environments characterized by significant multipath effects. Recently, emerging radio sensing applications have proposed the adoption of smart antennas with non-isotropic radiation characteristics to improve coverage.This letter investigates the impact of antenna radiation patterns in passive radio sensing applications. Adaptations of diffraction-based EM models are proposed to account for antenna non-uniform angular filtering. Next, we quantify experimentally the impact of diffraction and multipath disturbance components on radio sensing accuracy in environments with smart antennas.</description>

      <title>On Updating Static Output Feedback Controllers Under State-Space Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel update of a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller for a perturbed linear system. In almost every classical feedback controller design problem, a stabilizing feedback controller is designed given a stabilizable unstable system. In realistic scenarios, the system model is usually imperfect and subject to perturbations. A typical approach to attenuate the impacts of such perturbations on the system stability is repeating the whole controller design procedure to find an updated stabilizing SOF controller. Such an approach can be inefficient and occasionally infeasible. Using the notion of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP), we construct a simple norm minimization problem (a least-squares problem) to propose an efficient update of a nominal stabilizing SOF controller that can be applied to various control engineering applications in the case of perturbed scenarios like abrupt changes or inaccurate system models. In particular, considering norm-bounded known or unknown perturbations, this paper presents updated stabilizing SOF controllers and derives sufficient stability conditions. Geometric metrics to quantitatively measure the approach's robustness are defined. Moreover, we characterize the corresponding guaranteed stability regions, and specifically, for the case of norm-bounded unknown perturbations, we propose non-fragility-based robust updated stabilizing SOF controllers. Through extensive numerical simulations, we assess the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Policies for Uncertain Parametric Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesising verifiably correct controllers for dynamical systems is crucial for safety-critical problems. To achieve this, it is important to account for uncertainty in a robust manner, while at the same time it is often of interest to avoid being overly conservative with the view of achieving a better cost. We propose a method for verifiably safe policy synthesis for a class of finite state models, under the presence of structural uncertainty. In particular, we consider uncertain parametric Markov decision processes (upMDPs), a special class of Markov decision processes, with parameterised transition functions, where such parameters are drawn from a (potentially) unknown distribution. Our framework leverages recent advancements in the so-called scenario approach theory, where we represent the uncertainty by means of scenarios, and provide guarantees on synthesised policies satisfying probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) formulae. We consider several common benchmarks/problems and compare our work to recent developments for verifying upMDPs.</description>

      <title>Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control via Reachability Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven predictive control promises model-free wave-dampening strategies for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flow. However, its performance relies on data quality, which suffers from unknown noise and disturbances.This paper introduces a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (RDeeP-LCC) method based on reachability analysis, aiming to achieve safe and optimal CAV control under bounded process noise and external disturbances. Precisely, the matrix zonotope set technique and Willems' Fundamental Lemma are employed to derive the over-approximated system dynamics directly from data, and a data-driven feedback control technique is utilized to obtain an additional feedback input for stability. We decouple the mixed platoon into an error system and a nominal system, where the error system provides data-driven reachability sets for the enhanced safety constraints in the nominal system. Finally, a data-driven predictive control framework is formulated in a tube-based control manner for robustness guarantees. Nonlinear simulations with noise-corrupted data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods in mitigating traffic waves.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a state-feedback controller for a linear system, based only on noisy input-state data. We focus on input-state data corrupted by measurement errors, which, albeit less investigated, are as relevant as process disturbances in applications. For energy and instantaneous bounds on these measurement errors, we derive linear matrix inequalities for controller design where the one for the energy bound is equivalent to robust stabilization of all systems consistent with the noisy data points via a common Lyapunov function.</description>

      <title>Integrating Simulation Budget Management into Drum-Buffer-Rope: A Study on Parametrization and Reducing Computational Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In manufacturing, a bottleneck workstation frequently emerges, complicating production planning and escalating costs. To address this, Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) is a widely recognized production planning and control method that focuses on centralizing the bottleneck workstation, thereby improving production system performance. Although DBR is primarily focused on cre-ating a bottleneck schedule, the selection of planning parameters is crucial, as they significantly influence the scheduling process. Conducting a compre-hensive full factorial enumeration to identify the ideal planning parameters requires substantial computational effort. Simulation Budget Management (SBM) offers an effective concept to reduce this effort by skipping less promising parameter combinations. This publication introduces a method for integrating SBM into multi-stage multi-item DBR planned and controlled production system with limited capacity, aimed at determining the optimal planning parameters. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation study to analyze the effects of different production system environments, i.e., varying levels of shop load and process uncertainty, on both the performance and parame-terization of DBR and the efficacy of SBM. Our results show significant re-duction in simulation budget for identifying optimal planning parameters compared to traditional full factorial enumeration.</description>

Abstract: A method for identifying and quantifying the flexibility of electricity demand in a production plant is reported. The plant is equipped with electric machines, product storage silos, distributed generation, and electrical storage systems. The method aims to minimize production costs. To achieve this, the plant is mathematically modeled, and an economic optimization problem is formulated by managing these plant equipment. From this optimal schedule (base schedule), the feasibility of modifying it to sell or buy energy in the electricity balancing regulation markets is evaluated, thus obtaining the so called flexibility schedule. Finally, this method was successfully applied to a real case using data from a Spanish cement production plant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first propose systematic and comprehensive interval observer designs for linear time-invariant systems, under standard assumptions involving observability and interval bounds on the initial condition and disturbances. Historically, such designs rely on transformations with certain limitations into a form that is Metzler (for continuous time) or non-negative (for discrete time). We show that they can be effectively replaced with a linear time-invariant transformation that can be easily computed offline. Then, we propose the extension to the time-varying setting, where conventional transformations lack guaranteed outcomes. Academic examples are presented to illustrate our methods.</description>

      <title>On the implementation of zero-determinant strategies in repeated games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we further deepen our understanding on general mathematical properties of zero-determinant strategies. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These results assist us to implement zero-determinant strategies in broader situations.</description>

      <title>Integrating DeepRL with Robust Low-Level Control in Robotic Manipulators for Non-Repetitive Reaching Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In robotics, contemporary strategies are learning-based, characterized by a complex black-box nature and a lack of interpretability, which may pose challenges in ensuring stability and safety. To address these issues, we propose integrating a collision-free trajectory planner based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a novel auto-tuning low-level control strategy, all while actively engaging in the learning phase through interactions with the environment. This approach circumvents the control performance and complexities associated with computations while addressing nonrepetitive reaching tasks in the presence of obstacles. First, a model-free DRL agent is employed to plan velocity-bounded motion for a manipulator with 'n' degrees of freedom (DoF), ensuring collision avoidance for the end-effector through joint-level reasoning. The generated reference motion is then input into a robust subsystem-based adaptive controller, which produces the necessary torques, while the cuckoo search optimization (CSO) algorithm enhances control gains to minimize the stabilization and tracking error in the steady state. This approach guarantees robustness and uniform exponential convergence in an unfamiliar environment, despite the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. Theoretical assertions are validated through the presentation of simulation outcomes.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) body models designed to predict Radio-Frequency (RF) propagation are time-consuming methods which prevent their adoption in strict real-time computational imaging problems, such as human body localization and sensing. Physics-informed Generative Neural Network (GNN) models have been recently proposed to reproduce EM effects, namely to simulate or reconstruct missing data or samples by incorporating relevant EM principles and constraints. The paper discusses a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) model which is trained to reproduce the effects of human motions on the EM field and incorporate EM body diffraction principles. Proposed physics-informed generative neural network models are verified against both classical diffraction-based EM tools and full-wave EM body simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deal with the task assignment problem of multi-AUV systems under kinematic constraints, which means steering capability constraints for underactuated AUVs or other vehicles likely, an improved task assignment algorithm is proposed combining the Dubins Path algorithm with improved SOM neural network algorithm. At first, the aimed tasks are assigned to the AUVs by improved SOM neural network method based on workload balance and neighborhood function. When there exists kinematic constraints or obstacles which may cause failure of trajectory planning, task re-assignment will be implemented by change the weights of SOM neurals, until the AUVs can have paths to reach all the targets. Then, the Dubins paths are generated in several limited cases. AUV's yaw angle is limited, which result in new assignments to the targets. Computation flow is designed so that the algorithm in MATLAB and Python can realizes the path planning to multiple targets. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively accomplish the task assignment task for multi-AUV system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning in Sensor Fusion: A Comparative Analysis of Cubature and Sampling-based Integration Methods for Rover Search Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the computational speed and accuracy of two numerical integration methods, cubature and sampling-based, for integrating an integrand over a 2D polygon. Using a group of rovers searching the Martian surface with a limited sensor footprint as a test bed, the relative error and computational time are compared as the area was subdivided to improve accuracy in the sampling-based approach. The results show that the sampling-based approach exhibits a $14.75\%$ deviation in relative error compared to cubature when it matches the computational performance at $100\%$. Furthermore, achieving a relative error below $1\%$ necessitates a $10000\%$ increase in relative time to calculate due to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of the sampling-based method. It is concluded that for enhancing reinforcement learning capabilities and other high iteration algorithms, the cubature method is preferred over the sampling-based method.</description>
