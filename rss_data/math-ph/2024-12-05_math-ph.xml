      <title>Calculation of Spin Group Elements Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for calculation of spin groups elements for known pseudo-orthogonal group elements with respect to the corresponding two-sheeted coverings. We present our results using the Clifford algebra formalism in the case of arbitrary dimension and signature, and then explicitly using matrices, quaternions, and split-quaternions in the cases of all possible signatures (p,q) of space up to dimension n=p+q=3. The different formalisms are convenient for different possible applications in physics, engeneering, and computer science.</description>

      <title>Application of the Direct Interaction Approximation to generalized stochastic models in the turbulence problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to consider the application of the direct interaction approximation (DIA) developed by Kraichnan to generalized stochastic models in the turbulence problem. Previous developments (Kraichnan, Shivamoggi et al., Shivamoggi and Tuovila) were based on the Boltzmann-Gibbs prescription for the underlying entropy measure, which exhibits the extensivity property and is suited for ergodic systems. Here, we consider the introduction of an influence bias discriminating rare and frequent events explicitly, as behooves non-ergodic systems. More specifically, we consider the application of the DIA to a linear damped stochastic oscillator system using a Tsallis type autocorrelation model with an underlying non-extensive entropy measure, and describe the resulting stochastic process. We also deduce some apparently novel mathematical properties of the stochastic models associated with the present investigation -- the gamma distribution and the Tsallis non-extensive entropy.</description>

      <title>Eikonal 3.1: General solution for coupled system of eikonal equations, three space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general solution for a coupled system of eikonal equations $u_\mu u_\mu =0$, $v_\mu v_\mu =0$, $u_\mu v_\mu =1$ is presented, where lower indices designate derivatives, $\mu=0,1,2,3$, and summation is implied over the repeated indices. This solution is of interest by itself due to wide applications of the eikonal equations, but the system considered also appears to be part of the reduction conditions for many equations of mathematical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pair interaction on flat tori of functions whose Fourier coefficients are positive and decay sufficiently rapidly. In dimension one we find that the minimizer, up to translation, is the equidistant point set. In dimension two, minimizing with respect to triplets we find that the minimizer is the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for discrete uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity, diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic robustness of entanglement in noisy quantum networks and graph connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks are promising venues for quantum information processing. This motivates the study of the entanglement properties of the particular multipartite quantum states that underpin these structures. In particular, it has been recently shown that when the links are noisy two drastically different behaviors can occur regarding the global entanglement properties of the network. While in certain configurations the network displays genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) for any system size provided the noise level is below a certain threshold, in others GME is washed out if the system size is big enough for any fixed non-zero level of noise. However, this difference has only been established considering the two extreme cases of maximally and minimally connected networks (i.e. complete graphs versus trees, respectively). In this article we investigate this question much more in depth and relate this behavior to the growth of several graph theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity of the graph sequence that codifies the structure of the network as the number of parties increases. The strongest conditions are obtained when considering the degree growth. Our main results are that a sufficiently fast degree growth (i.e. $\Omega(N)$, where $N$ is the size of the network) is sufficient for asymptotic robustness of GME, while if it is sufficiently slow (i.e. $o(\log N)$) then the network becomes asymptotically biseparable. We also present several explicit constructions related to the optimality of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ehlers and Kundt [1] argued in favor of the velocity effect: particles initally at rest hit by a burst of gravitational waves should fly apart with constant velocity after the wave has passed. Zel'dovich and Polnarev [2] suggested instead that waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed provided the wave parameters take some particular values.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution for Vacuum Energy Flux Fluctuations in Two Spacetime Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized coherent states for the harmonic oscillator by the J-matrix method with an extension to the Morse potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02958v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While dealing with the J-Matrix method for the harmonic oscillator to write down its tridiagonal matrix representation in an orthonormal basis of L2(R); we rederive a set of generalized coherent states (GCS) of Perelomov type labeled by points z of the complex plane C and depending on a positive integer number m The number states expansion of these GCS gives rise to coefficients that are complex Hermite polynomials whose linear superpositions provide eigenfunctions for the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian associated with the mth Landau level. We extend this procedure to the Morse oscillator by constructing a new set of GCS of Glauber type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a system of partial differential equations that has an extended Kovalevskaya form, a reduction procedure is presented that allows one to use a local (point, contact, or higher) symmetry of a system and a symmetry-invariant conservation law to algorithmically calculate constants of motion holding for symmetry-invariant solutions. Several examples including cases of point and higher symmetry invariance are presented and discussed. An implementation of the algorithm in Maple is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the numerators of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series are the (transpose of the) matrix of $q,t$-Kostka Macdonald coefficients $K_d = \left( K_{\lambda \mu} \left( q,t \right) \right)_{\lambda, \mu \in \mathcal{P}_d}$ for partitions $\lambda = \mu$ in the set of partitions $\mathcal{P}_d$ of odd positive numbers $d$ with $d=2n-1$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, such that $\lambda = \mu = \left( 1 \right)$ if $n=1$, and $\lambda = \mu = \left( n, 1^{n-1} \right)$ if $n &gt; 1$. These polynomials are also shown to be eigenvalues of a differential operator arising from a recurrence relation and acting on the Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials arising from hexagon tilings with 3x3-periodic weightings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials (MVOP) appear in the study of doubly periodic tiling models. Of particular interest is their limiting behavior as the degree tends to infinity. In recent years, MVOP associated with doubly periodic domino tilings of the Aztec diamond have been successfully analyzed. The MVOP related to doubly periodic lozenge tilings of a hexagon are more complicated. In this paper we focus on a special subclass of hexagon tilings with 3x3 periodicity. The special subclass leads to a genus one spectral curve with additional symmetries that allow us to find an equilibrium measure in an external field explicitly. The equilibrium measure gives the asymptotic distribution for the zeros of the determinant of the MVOP. The associated g-functions appear in the strong asymptotic formula for the MVOP that we obtain from a steepest descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for MVOP.</description>

Abstract: This is the companion paper of the letter arXiv:2410.15695, containing all the details and series of examples on a 4d mirror symmetry for the class-$\mathcal{S}$ theories which relates the representation theory of the chiral quantization of the Higgs branch and the geometry of the Coulomb branch. We study the representation theory by using the 4d/VOA correspondence, (defect) Schur indices and (flavor) modular differential equations, and match the data with the fixed manifolds of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This correspondence extends the connection between Higgs and Coulomb branch of Argyres-Douglas theories, and can provide systematic guidance for the study of the representation theory of vertex operator algebras by exploiting results from Hitchin systems.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}(\cal{N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}(\cal{N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) the $\kappa$-symmetric action for a superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $; and (ii) some implications of conformal flatness in the ${\cal N}=2$ case.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of trained quantum neural networks to a Gaussian process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum neural networks where the generated function is the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables across all qubits. In [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726], it is proven that the probability distributions of such generated functions converge in distribution to a Gaussian process in the limit of infinite width for both untrained networks with randomly initialized parameters and trained networks. In this paper, we provide a quantitative proof of this convergence in terms of the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. First, we establish an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by any untrained network with finite width and the Gaussian process with the same covariance. This proof utilizes Stein's method to estimate the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. Next, we analyze the training dynamics of the network via gradient flow, proving an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by the trained network and the corresponding Gaussian process. This proof is based on a quantitative upper bound on the maximum variation of a parameter during training. This bound implies that for sufficiently large widths, training occurs in the lazy regime, \emph{i.e.}, each parameter changes only by a small amount. While the convergence result of [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726] holds at a fixed training time, our upper bounds are uniform in time and hold even as $t \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T) \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data $\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s &gt; 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data in a generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces in complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong \mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.</description>

      <title>TASEP with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step initial condition along a space-like path.
  Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the macroscopic empirical density.
  As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit distribution within the framework of particle positions.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation of three parallel spins with genuine and restricted collective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective measurements on identical and independent quantum systems are advantageous in information extraction than individual measurements. However, little is known about the distinction between restricted collective measurements and genuine collective measurements in the multipartite setting. In this work we establish a rigorous performance gap based on a simple and old estimation problem, the estimation of a random spin state given three parallel spins. Notably, we derive an analytical formula for the maximum estimation fidelity of biseparable measurements and clarify its fidelity gap from genuine collective measurements. Moreover, we show that this estimation fidelity can be achieved by two- and one-copy measurements assisted by one-way communication in one direction, but not the other way. Our work reveals a rich landscape of multipartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements instead of quantum states and is expected to trigger further studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the past asymptotics of $(2+1)$-dimensional solutions to the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system which are close to Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes on an initial hypersurface diffeomorphic to a closed orientable surface $M$ of arbitrary genus. We prove that such solutions are past causally geodesically incomplete and exhibit stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up in the contracting direction. In particular, they are $C^2$-inextendible towards the past where causal geodesics become incomplete. Moreover, we show that geometry and matter are asymptotically velocity term dominated toward the past, remaining close to their background counterparts. Where the asymptotics do not coincide with those of the isotropic background solution, the momentum support of the Vlasov distribution approaches a smooth one-dimensional subbundle of the mass shell. Compared to previous results in higher dimensions, inhomogeneous terms in the wave and Vlasov equations factor in more strongly in our setting, which a priori creates additional hurdles to establish stability. As a corollary, our main result shows that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for certain polarized $U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that emanate from a spatial hypersurface diffeomorphic to $M\times\mathbb{S}^1$.</description>

      <title>Large spin measurements in an arbitrary two-qudit state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality by a bipartite quantum state is now used in many quantum applications. However, the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin measurements is still known only in a two-qubit case. In the present article, for a two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension $d=2s+1\geq2$, we introduce the notion of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix, having dimension $3\times3$ for all $d\geq2$; establish its relation to the general correlation $(d^{2}-1)\times (d^{2}-1)$ matrix of this state within the generalized Pauli representation and derive in terms of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in this state. Specifying this general expression for the two-qudit GHZ state, the nonlocal two-qudit Werner state and some nonseparable pure two-qudit states, we find that, under large spin ($s\geq1$) measurements in each of these nonseparable states, including the maximally entangled one, the CHSH inequality is not violated. Moreover, unlike the case of spin-$1/2$ measurements, where each pure nonseparable two-qubit state violates the CHSH inequality and the maximal value of its CHSH expectation increases with a growth of its entanglement degree, the situation under large spin measurements is quite different --for a pure two-qudit state with a higher degree of entanglement, the maximal value of the CHSH expectation turns out to be less than for a pure two-qudit state with lower entanglement and even for a separable one.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions returned by stable algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the meromorphic continuation of certain hypergeometric integrals modeled on the Selberg integral, including the 3-point and 4-point functions of BPZ's minimal models of 2D CFT as described by Felder and Silvotti and Dotsenko and Fateev (the ``Coulomb gas formalism''). This is accomplished via a geometric analysis of the singularities of the integrands. In the case that the integrand is symmetric (as in the Selberg integral itself) or, more generally, what we call ``DF-symmetric,'' we show that a number of apparent singularities are removable, as required for the construction of the minimal models via these methods.</description>

      <title>Symplectic duality via log topological recursion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this matter.</description>

      <title>The second order Huang-Yang formula to the 3D Fermi gas: the Gross-Pitaevskii regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a system of $N$ Fermions of spin $1/2$, with its interaction potential of scattering length $a$, the classical Huang-Yang formula states that the energy density $e(\rho)$ is of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  e(\rho)=\frac{3}{5}(3\pi^2)^{\frac{2}{3}}\rho^{\frac{5}{3}}+2\pi a\rho^2
  +\frac{12}{35}(11-2\ln2)3^{\frac{1}{3}}\pi^{\frac{2}{3}}a^2\rho^{\frac{7}{3}}
  +o(\rho^{\frac{7}{3}}).
  \end{equation*}
  We consider a general system of $N$ Fermions of spin $1/\mathbf{q}$ with the scattering length of the interaction potential at the scale $a\propto N^{-1}$, that is, in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. We prove the 2nd order ground state energy approximation corresponding to the Huang-Yang formula. The thermodynamic limit case shares a similar logic, and could be dealt with in a separate paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalization of the Araki-Uhlmann formula for relative entropy to Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy. We compute this entropy for a free scalar field in the Minkowski wedge between the vacuum and a coherent state, as well as for the free chiral current in a thermal state. In contrast to the relative entropy which in these cases only depends on the sympletic form and thus reduces to the classical entropy of a wave packet, the Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy also depends on the symmetric part of the two-point function and is thus genuinely quantum. We also consider the relation with standard subspaces, where we define the R\'enyi entropy of a vector and show that it admits an upper bound given by the entropy of the vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common folklore that semiclassical arguments suggest that in black hole evaporation an initially pure state can become mixed. This is known as the \emph{information loss puzzle} (or {\it paradox}). Here we argue that, if taken at face value, semiclassical gravity suggests the formation of a final singularity instead of information loss. A quantum strong cosmic censorship conjecture, for which we give a rigorous statement, supports this conclusion. Thus, there are no reasons to expect a failure of unitarity in black hole evaporation or for any quantum gravity theory that can `cure' singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic Forchheimer-typed flows for compressible fluids in porous media. The first half of the paper is devoted to understanding the nonlinear structure of the anisotropic momentum equations. Unlike the isotropic flows, the important monotonicity properties are not automatically satisfied in this case. Therefore, various sufficient conditions for them are derived and applied to the experimental data. In the second half of the paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the steady state flows subject to a nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. It is also established that these steady states, in appropriate functional spaces, have local H\"older continuous dependence on the forcing function and the boundary data.</description>

Abstract: The global magnificent four theory is the homological version of a maximally supersymmetric $(8+1)$-dimensional gauge theory on a Calabi-Yau fourfold fibered over a circle. In the case of a toric fourfold we conjecture the formula for its twisted Witten index. String-theoretically we count the BPS states of a system of $D0$-$D2$-$D4$-$D6$-$D8$-branes on the Calabi-Yau fourfold in the presence of a large Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Mathematically, we develop the equivariant $K$-theoretic DT4 theory, by constructing the four-valent vertex with generic plane partition asymptotics. Physically, the vertex is a supersymmetric localization of a non-commutative gauge theory in $8+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>First passage percolation, local uniqueness for interlacements and capacity of random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of first passage percolation (FPP) for the random interlacements model has been initiated in arXiv:2112.12096, where it is shown that on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$, the FPP distance is comparable to the graph distance with high probability. In this article, we give an asymptotically sharp lower bound on this last probability, which additionally holds on a large class of transient graphs with polynomial volume growth and polynomial decay of the Green function. When considering the interlacement set in the low-intensity regime, the previous bound is in fact valid throughout the near-critical phase. In low dimension, we also present two applications of this FPP result: sharp large deviation bounds on local uniqueness of random interlacements, and on the capacity of a random walk in a ball.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system with unreduced dynamics governed by invertible propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.</description>

      <title>Relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A closed-form relaxation model for homogeneous plasmas could be presented in terms of Gauss hypergeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model and the zeroth-order Braginskii heat transfer model can also be derived. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model based on the hypothesis that the plasmas system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, without relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>

      <title>Stable standing waves for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>Explicit symplectic integrators with adaptive time steps in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, our group developed explicit symplectic methods for curved spacetimes that are not split into several explicitly integrable parts, but are via appropriate time transformations. Such time-transformed explicit symplectic integrators should have employed adaptive time steps in principle, but they are often difficult in practical implementations. In fact, they work well if time transformation functions cause the time-transformed Hamiltonians to have the desired splits and approach 1 or constants for sufficiently large distances. However, they do not satisfy the requirement of step-size selections in this case. Based on the step-size control technique proposed by Preto $\&amp;$ Saha, the nonadaptive time step time-transformed explicit symplectic methods are slightly adjusted as adaptive ones. The adaptive methods have only two additional steps and a negligible increase in computational cost as compared with the nonadaptive ones. Their implementation is simple. Several dynamical simulations of particles and photons near black holes have demonstrated that the adaptive methods typically improve the efficiency of the nonadaptive methods. Because of the desirable property, the new adaptive methods are applied to investigate the chaotic dynamics of particles and photons outside the horizon in a Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. The new methods are widely applicable to all curved spacetimes corresponding to Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians with the expected splits. Also application to the backwards ray-tracing method for studying the motion of photons and shadows of black holes is possible.</description>
