      <title>Immunological mechanisms and immunoregulatory strategies in intervertebral disc degeneration</title>

Abstract: Intervertebral discs are avascular and maintain immune privilege. However, during intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), this barrier is disrupted, leading to extensive immune cell infiltration and localized inflammation. In degenerated discs, macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) are key players, exhibiting functional heterogeneity. Dysregulated activation of inflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, drives local pro-inflammatory responses, leading to cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Innovative immunotherapies, including exosome-based treatments, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, and chemokine-loaded hydrogel systems, have shown promise in reshaping the immunological niche of intervertebral discs. These strategies can modulate dysregulated immune responses and create a supportive environment for tissue regeneration. However, current studies have not fully elucidated the mechanisms of inflammatory memory and the immunometabolic axis, and they face challenges in balancing tissue regeneration with immune homeostasis. Future studies should employ interdisciplinary approaches such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map a comprehensive immune atlas of IDD, elucidate intercellular crosstalk and signaling networks, and develop integrated therapies combining targeted immunomodulation with regenerative engineering, thereby facilitating the clinical translation of effective IDD treatments.</description>
