      <title>Cops and Robbers for Graphs on Surfaces with Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a game played on a graph where a set of cops attempt to capture a single robber. The game proceeds in rounds, where each round first consists of the cops' turn, followed by the robber's turn. In the cops' turn, every cop can choose to either stay on the same vertex or move to an adjacent vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. The robber is considered to be captured if, at any point in time, there is some cop on the same vertex as the robber. A natural question in this game concerns the cop-number of a graph -- the minimum number of cops needed to capture the robber. It has long been known that graphs embeddable (without crossings) on surfaces of bounded genus have bounded cop-number. In contrast, the class of 1-planar graphs -- graphs that can be drawn on the plane with at most one crossing per edge -- does not have bounded cop-number. This paper initiates an investigation into how distance between crossing pairs of edges influences a graph's cop number. In particular, we look at Distance $d$ Cops and Robbers, a variant of the classical game, where the robber is considered to be captured if there is a cop within distance $d$ of the robber. Let $c_d(G)$ denote the minimum number of cops required in the graph $G$ to capture a robber within distance $d$. We look at various classes of graphs, such as 1-plane graphs, $k$-plane graphs (graphs where each edge is crossed at most $k$ times), and even general graph drawings, and show that if every crossing pair of edges can be connected by a path of small length, then $c_d(G)$ is bounded, for small values of $d$.</description>

      <title>Effective Computation of Generalized Abelian Complexity for Pisot Type Substitutive Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized abelian equivalence compares words by their factors up to a certain bounded length. The associated complexity function counts the equivalence classes for factors of a given size of an infinite sequence. How practical is this notion? When can these equivalence relations and complexity functions be computed efficiently? We study the fixed points of substitution of Pisot type. Each of their $k$-abelian complexities is bounded and the Parikh vectors of their length-$n$ prefixes form synchronized sequences in the associated Dumont--Thomas numeration system. Therefore, the $k$-abelian complexity of Pisot substitution fixed points is automatic in the same numeration system. Two effective generic construction approaches are investigated using the \texttt{Walnut} theorem prover and are applied to several examples. We obtain new properties of the Tribonacci sequence, such as a uniform bound for its factor balancedness together with a two-dimensional linear representation of its generalized abelian complexity functions.</description>

      <title>$O(p \log d)$ Subgraph Isomorphism using Stigmergic Swarming Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (sets of nodes joined by edges) to determine whether they contain a common subgraph. Many applications require identifying the subgraph, not just deciding its existence. A particularly common use case, using graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a smaller pattern graph with $p$ nodes in the larger data graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, so that na\"ive solutions are exponential in $p + d$. A wide range of heuristics have been proposed, with the best complexity $O(p^2d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson problem. ASSIST is linearithmic, $O(p \log d)$, and also supports matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.</description>

      <title>On Piecewise Affine Reachability with Bellman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A piecewise affine map is one of the simplest mathematical objects exhibiting complex dynamics. The reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is as follows: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f$, is there $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? Koiran, Cosnard, and Garzon show that the reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is undecidable even in dimension 2.
  Most of the recent progress has been focused on decision procedures for one-dimensional piecewise affine maps, where the reachability problem has been shown to be decidable for some subclasses. However, the general undecidability discouraged research into positive results in arbitrary dimension.
  In this work, we investigate a rich subclass of piecewise affine maps arising as Bellman operators of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We consider the reachability problem restricted to this subclass and examine its decidability in arbitrary dimensions. We establish that the reachability problem for Bellman operators is decidable in any dimension under either of the following conditions (i) the target vector $\mathbf{t}$ is not the fixed point of the operator $f$; or (ii) the initial and target vectors $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are comparable with respect to the componentwise order. Furthermore, we show that the reachability problem for two-dimensional Bellman operators is decidable for arbitrary $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t}\in \mathbb{Q}^d$, in contrast to the known undecidability of reachability for general piecewise affine maps.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of individual judgments in the quantitative pairwise comparisons method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making methods very often use the technique of comparing alternatives in pairs. In this approach, experts are asked to compare different options, and then a quantitative ranking is created from the results obtained. It is commonly believed that experts (decision-makers) are honest in their judgments. In our work, we consider a scenario in which experts are vulnerable to bribery. For this purpose, we define a framework that allows us to determine the intended manipulation and present three algorithms for achieving the intended goal. Analyzing these algorithms may provide clues to help defend against such attacks.</description>

      <title>Centered colorings in minor-closed graph classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vertex coloring $\varphi$ of a graph $G$ is $p$-centered if for every connected subgraph $H$ of $G$, either $\varphi$ uses more than $p$ colors on $H$, or there is a color that appears exactly once on $H$. We prove that for every fixed positive integer $t$, every $K_t$-minor-free graph admits a $p$-centered coloring using $\mathcal{O}(p^{t-1})$ colors.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Bases in Matroid with Exponentially Large Ground Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When we deal with a matroid ${\mathcal M}=(U,{\mathcal I})$, we usually assume that it is implicitly given by means of the membership (MEM) oracle. Time complexity of many existing algorithms is polynomially bounded with respect to $|U|$ and the running time of the MEM-oracle. However, they are not efficient any more when $U$ is exponentially large in some context. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for enumerating matroid bases such that the time complexity does not depend on $|U|$. The first algorithm enumerates all minimum-weighted bases in incremental-polynomial time. To design the algorithm, we assume two oracles other than the MEM-oracle: the MinB-oracle that returns a minimum basis and the REL-oracle that returns a relevant element one by one in non-decreasing order of weight. The proposed algorithm is applicable to enumeration of minimum bases of binary matroids from cycle space and cut space, all of which have exponentially large $U$ with respect to a given graph. The highlight in this context is that, to design the REL-oracle for cut space, we develop the first polynomial-delay algorithm that enumerates all relevant cuts of a given graph in non-decreasing order of weight. The second algorithm enumerates all sets of linearly independent $r$-dimensional $r$ vectors over $\mathit{GF}(2)$ in polynomial-delay, which immediately yields a polynomial-delay algorithm with respect to the matroid rank $r$ that enumerates all unweighted bases of a binary matroid such that elements are closed under addition.</description>
