      <title>Generalized Multi-agent Social Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent social interaction has clearly benefited from Large Language Models. However, current simulation systems still face challenges such as difficulties in scaling to diverse scenarios and poor reusability due to a lack of modular design. To address these issues, we designed and developed a modular, object-oriented framework that organically integrates various base classes through a hierarchical structure, harvesting scalability and reusability. We inherited the framework to realize common derived classes. Additionally, a memory summarization mechanism is proposed to filter and distill relevant information from raw memory data, prioritizing contextually salient events and interactions. By selecting and combining some necessary derived classes, we customized a specific simulated environment. Utilizing this simulated environment, we successfully simulated human interactions on social media, replicating real-world online social behaviors. The source code for the project will be released and evolve.</description>

      <title>Modeling amortization systems with vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amortization systems are used widely in economy to generate payment schedules to repaid an initial debt with its interest. We present a generalization of these amortization systems by introducing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics based on vector spaces. Operators are defined for debt, amortization, interest and periodic payment and their mean values are computed in different orthonormal basis. The vector space of the amortization system will have dimension M, where M is the loan maturity and the vectors will have a SO(M) symmetry, yielding the possibility of rotating the basis of the vector space while preserving the distance among vectors. The results obtained are useful to add degrees of freedom to the usual amortization systems without affecting the interest profits of the lender while also benefitting the borrower who is able to alter the payment schedules. Furthermore, using the tensor product of algebras, we introduce loans entanglement in which two borrowers can correlate the payment schedules without altering the total repaid.</description>

      <title>What day is the peak of birth in France?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last ten years, from 2015 to 2024, the day with the highest average number of births was on the 20th of July, while Christmas Day recorded the fewest. Apart from July, a noticeable concentration of births occurred in late September, reflecting conceptions that took place during the end of year holidays. Births tended to be less frequent on weekends and public holidays. Since the 1970s, France's ``baby season'' shifted from spring to summer. From 1975 to 2010, heat waves were most often followed by a dip in births 9 months later, in April or May. This effect became less pronounced in recent years, as heatwaves grew in frequency. Another striking change was the sharp decline, since the 1970s, of the traditional April baby boom among primary school teachers.</description>

      <title>Space, time and altruism in pandemics and the climate emergency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is a global emergency, as was the COVID-19 pandemic. Why was our collective response to COVID-19 so much stronger than our response to the climate emergency, to date? We hypothesize that the answer has to do with the scale of the systems, and not just spatial and temporal scales but also the `altruistic scale' that measures whether an action must rely upon altruistic motives for it to be adopted. We treat COVID-19 and climate change as common pool resource problems that exemplify coupled human-environment systems. We introduce a framework that captures regimes of containment, mitigation, and failure to control. As parameters governing these three scales are varied, it is possible to shift from a COVID-like system to a climate-like system. The framework replicates both inaction in the case of climate change mitigation, as well as the faster response that we exhibited to COVID-19. Our cross-system comparison also suggests actionable ways that cooperation can be improved in large-scale common pool resources problems, like climate change. More broadly, we argue that considering scale and incorporating human-natural system feedbacks are not just interesting special cases within non-cooperative game theory, but rather should be the starting point for the study of altruism and human cooperation.</description>

      <title>Coupled opinion-environmental dynamics in polarized and prejudiced populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public opinion on environmental issues remains polarized in many countries, posing a significant barrier to the implementation of effective policies. Behind this polarization, empirical studies have identified social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience as dominant factors in opinion formation on environmental issues. However, current coupled human-environment models have not yet incorporated all three factors in polarized populations. We developed a stylized coupled human-environment model to investigate how social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience shape opinion formation and the environment in polarized populations. Using analytical and numerical methods, we characterized the conditions under which polarization, consensus, opinion changes, and cyclic dynamics emerge depending on the costs of mitigation, environmental damage, and the factors influencing opinion formation. Our model shows that prejudice is the key driver of persistent polarization, with even slightly prejudiced populations maintaining indefinite polarization independent of their level of objectivity. We predict that polarization can be reduced by decreasing the role of prejudice or increasing the willingness to consider opposing opinions. Finally, our model shows that cost reduction methods are less effective at reducing environmental impact in prejudiced populations. Our model generates thresholds for when reducing costs or emissions is more useful depending on the factors which influence the population's opinion formation. Overall, our model provides a framework for investigating the importance of cognitive and social structures in determining human-environment dynamics.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum to "Degree-Based Approximations for Network Reliability Polynomials". Comment on J. Complex Networks 2025, 13, cnaf001</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our original paper \cite{VanMieghem2025} described the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G(p)=\bigl[1-\phi_D(1-p)\bigr]^{N}$ in \cite[eq. (2.2)]{VanMieghem2025} and the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G(p)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\!\bigl[1-(1-p)^{d_i}\bigr]$ in \cite[eq. (4.1)]{VanMieghem2025} as upper bounds for the all-terminal reliability polynomial \(rel_G(p)\). The present corrigendum clarifies that the unique upper bound is \(\Pr[\hat D_{\min}\geq 1]\), which is difficult to compute exactly, because we must account for correlated node-isolation events. Both the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G$ and the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G$ ignore those correlations, assume independence and, consequently, do not always upperbound \(rel_G(p)\) as stated previously. The complete graph \(K_{3}\) is a counterexample, where both approximations lie below the exact reliability polynomial $rel_{K_3}(p)$, illustrating that they are not upper bounds. Moreover, as claimed in \cite{VanMieghem2025}, the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G$ is not always more accurate than the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G$. We show by an example that the relative accuracy of the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G$ and the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G$ varies with the graph $G$ and the link operational probability $p$. }{network robustness, node failure, probabilistic graph, reliability polynomial</description>

      <title>Economic Entropy and Sectoral Dynamics: A Thermodynamic Approach to Market Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an application of geometrothermodynamics (GTD) to the economic analysis of Bogot\'a's sports sector through the Satellite Account of Sport (CSDB). By establishing an analogy between thermodynamic systems and economic structures, we develop a mathematical framework where monetary flows behave analogously to energy, while economic entropy, temperature, and heat capacity acquire well-defined economic interpretations. The study focuses on two contrasting sectors: gambling and betting $\mathbb{S}_{15}$, and recreational and sports activities $\mathbb{S}_{16}$, analyzing data from 2018-2023. Our results demonstrate that $\mathbb{S}_{15}$ exhibits lower economic entropy than $\mathbb{S}_{16}$ , indicating a higher degree of organization and regulatory structure in the gambling sector compared to the more heterogeneous recreational sports sector. The heat capacity function reveals critical points that may signal phase transitions in economic dynamics, while Ricci and Kretschmann curvature scalars identify potential crisis points in the sectoral organization. Furthermore, the cross-income elasticity analysis shows distinct resource flow patterns between sectors, suggesting that gambling activities may serve as an economic driver for recreational sports. This thermodynamic approach provides a quantitative tool for analyzing resource redistribution policies and anticipating critical transitions in sectoral economics. The findings suggest that econophysics and statistical thermodynamics constitute powerful frameworks for understanding the sectoral dynamics of Bogot\'a's sports economy, with significant potential for developing prospective analysis tools in public policy design.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modeling of knowledge and wealth dynamics in national and global markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a kinetic model to describe the dynamical evolution of wealth and knowledge in national and global markets, starting from a microscopic description of individual interactions. The model is built upon interaction rules that account for a strong interdependence between the microscopic variables, influencing agents' trading and saving propensities, knowledge acquisition, and the stochastic market effects. We begin with a domestic market scenario and extend the framework to international trade, incorporating the possibility of individual transfers between different countries. The dynamics of the system are described through Boltzmann-type equations, which allow for a detailed study of the evolution of the agent distribution in each country. In this context, we study the evolution of macroscopic quantities of the system, focusing on the number density of individuals, and the mean wealth and knowledge of each population, and we discuss these results in relation to existing models in the literature. Finally, under a quasi-invariant trading limit, we derive simplified Fokker-Planck type equations that reveal some emergent behaviors of the system, including the formation of Pareto tails in the long-term wealth and knowledge distributions.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Model for Human Mobility Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we present MobilityGen, a deep generative model that produces realistic mobility trajectories spanning days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation, and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse, plausible, and novel mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard validation, MobilityGen yields insights not attainable with earlier models, including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Our work establishes a new framework for mobility simulation, paving the way for fine-grained, data-driven studies of human behavior and its societal implications.</description>

      <title>Consensus as cooling: a granular gas model for continuous opinions on structured networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous-opinion model accounting for the social compromise propensity is theoretically and numerically analysed. An agent's opinion is represented by a real number that can be changed through social interactions with her neighbours. The proposed dynamics depends on two fundamental parameters, $\alpha\in[-1,1]$ and $\beta\ge 0$. If an interaction takes place between two agents, their relative opinions decreases an amount given by $\alpha$. The probability of two neighbours to interact is proportional to the $\beta$-power of their relative opinions. We unveil the behaviour of the system for all physical relevant values of the parameters and several representative interaction networks. When $\alpha\in(-1,1)$ and $\beta\ge 0$, the system always reaches consensus, with all agents having the mean initial opinion, provided the interaction network is connected. The approach to consensus can be characterized by means of the mean opinion and the temperature (or opinion dispersion) of each agent. Three scenarios have been identified. When the agents are well mixed, as with all-to-all interactions, a pre-consensus regime is seen, with all agents having zero mean opinion and the same temperature, following the Haff's law of granular gases. A similar regime is observed with Erd\"os-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks: mean opinions are zero but agents with different degrees have different temperatures, though still following the Haff's law. Finally, the case of a square 2D lattice has been carefully analyzed, by starting from the derivation of closed set of hydrodynamic-like equations using the Chapman-Enskog method ...</description>

      <title>Machines in the Crowd? Measuring the Footprint of Machine-Generated Text on Reddit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping online communication by enabling large-scale production of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) at low cost. While its presence is rapidly growing across the Web, little is known about how MGT integrates into social media environments. In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-art statistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity (2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main community types such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study the concentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT to human-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement it receives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates that synthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to 9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed across communities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge and social support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction of users. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status giving typical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGT achieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a few cases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organic component of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective on the MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involving platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orderly behaviors observed in large-scale groups, such as fish schooling and the organized movement of crowds, are both ubiquitous and essential for the survival and stability of these systems. Understanding how such complex collective behaviors emerge from simple local interactions and behavioral adjustments is a significant scientific challenge. Historically, research has predominantly focused on imitation and social learning, where individuals adopt the strategies of more successful peers to refine their behavior. However, in recent years, an alternative learning approach based on self-exploration and introspective learning has garnered increasing attention. In this paradigm, individuals assess their own circumstances and select strategies that best align with their specific conditions. Two examples are coordination and anti-coordination, where individuals align with and diverge from the local majority, respectively. In this study, we analyze networked systems of coordinating and anti-coordinating individuals, exploring the combined effects of system dynamics, network structure, and behavioral patterns. We address several practical questions, including the number of equilibria, their characteristics, the equilibrium time, and the resilience of the system. We find that the number of equilibrium states can be extremely large, even increasing exponentially with minor alterations to the network structure. Moreover, the network structure has a significant impact on the average equilibrium time. Despite the complexity of these findings, we find that variations can be captured by a single, simple network characteristic (the average path length), which we illustrate in both synthetic and empirical networks.</description>
