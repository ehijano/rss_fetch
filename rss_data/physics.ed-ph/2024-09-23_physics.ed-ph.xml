      <title>Intuitive Derivation of the Coriolis Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The major difficulty when one teaches about non-inertial reference frames in undergraduate courses on Classical Mechanics is to find an intuitive way to derive the Coriolis acceleration. Indeed, there is a factor of 2 in the formula for the Coriolis acceleration and this factor is shrouded in mystery. In this paper we not only show an intuitive way to derive the Coriolis acceleration but we also show why there is a factor of 2. Indeed, it turns out that the Coriolis acceleration results from two completely different reasons (and hence the factor of 2). The first reason is this - as the particle moves to a new position, it `sees` a different local velocity of the rotating frame. The second reason is purely geometrical - the velocity vector is subjected to purely geometrical rotation due to the rotation of the reference frame. Both of these contributions unite and they result in the Coriolis acceleration.</description>

      <title>A Hands-on Experience with a Novel Scintillation Detector for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle physics, when taught in the classroom or lecture theatre, suffers from a lack of practical experience by students. Thus, we describe the construction of a fully working small particle physics detector using state of the art detector technology for demonstration in educational context. Most of our setup can be constructed with relatively moderate effort, given that a home-level 3D-printer, a photosensor and readout electronics (at least an oscilloscope) are available.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Piano: analysing the sound of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Cosmic Piano, an innovative outreach tool designed to detect muons from air showers produced by cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere. The Cosmic Piano consists of scintillator-based modules with avalanche photodiodes (APD) readout, which produce a musical note and a flash of light whenever a muon passes through one of them and triggers its electronics. The Cosmic Piano has been showcased at various high-profile events, including the Montreux Jazz Festival and the EuroScience Open Forum, seamlessly fusing scientific phenomena with live music. Building on its success, we have developed a new, comprehensive Masterclass session aimed at engaging high school and university students. This session includes analysing both simulated cosmic ray events and real data from the Cosmic Piano. The Masterclass provides participants with a hands-on experience that mirrors the experimental procedures used in major physics experiments, such as those conducted at CERN with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collision data. This initiative offers a unique opportunity for students to engage with an active experiment, bridging the gap between outreach and serious scientific research.</description>

      <title>Hands-on Quantum Programming Labs for EECS Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14002v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a practical approach to teaching quantum computing to Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science (EECS) students through dedicated hands-on programming labs. The labs cover a diverse range of topics, encompassing fundamental elements, such as entanglement, quantum gates and circuits, as well as advanced algorithms including Quantum Key Distribution, Deutsch and Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithms, Simon's algorithm, and Grover's algorithm. As educators, we aim to share our teaching insights and resources with fellow instructors in the field. The full lab handouts and program templates are provided for interested instructors. Furthermore, the report elucidates the rationale behind the design of each experiment, enabling a deeper understanding of quantum computing.</description>
