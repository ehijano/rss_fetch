      <title>An Investigation into the Low-Mass Fundamental Metallicity Relation in the Local and High-z Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed high-$z$ star-forming galaxies depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the $z = 0$ FMR has not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime ($\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$) for an appropriate comparison of low- and high-$z$ systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-$z$ FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for $\sim 700$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ emitters with $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ at $z \sim 0$. We find no evidence of the FMR below $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields ($y_{\rm eff}$) spanning $\rm \sim 3~dex$. We demonstrate increasing $y_{\rm eff}$ correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot lead to the $y_{\rm eff}$ diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-$\rm M_{\star}$ systems, regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate $z \gtrsim 3$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ systems are indeed more metal-poor than $z \sim 0$ counterparts ($\rm \Delta 12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex$) at fixed $\rm M_{\star}$.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Globular Clusters: A Structural and Kinematic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) play a major role in the structural and dynamical evolutions of Globular Clusters (GCs). Several recent works searched for BHs in Galactic GCs using scaling relations derived from numerical simulations. However, the conclusions drawn by such approaches are strongly dependent on the specific prescriptions adopted in numerical simulations. Therefore, we analyzed a survey of 101 Monte Carlo simulations to identify some observable parameters that allow us to probe the present-day BH population in GCs reliably. We thoroughly show that a single observable is not suited to infer the BH mass fraction in real GCs: similar values could be attained by systems with different BH mass fractions, depending on the specific dynamical evolution of the system. Finally, we present a combination of observable parameters that efficiently breaks this degeneracy. We also compare values from numerical simulations with a sample of Galactic GCs.</description>

      <title>Taming the plunge: A circularization trap of supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening. We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$): migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates $\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy, $\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$), eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e \approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping, the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear. Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in cosmological frameworks.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the kinematic properties of rotating multiple-population globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations differing in their chemical and dynamical properties. A number of models for the formation of multiple populations predict that the subsystem of second generation (SG) stars is characterized by a more centrally concentrated spatial distribution and a more rapid rotation than the system of first generation (FG) stars. We present the results of N-body simulations exploring the long-term dynamical evolution of rotating multiple-population GCs. We study the evolution of systems starting with four different orientations of the GC's total internal angular momentum vector relative to the orbital angular momentum. We explore the evolution driven by two-body relaxation and the effects of the GC's interaction with the galactic tidal field. We focus on the kinematic differences between the two generations and we quantify them by exploring the FG and SG rotation velocity and angular momenta. We find that kinematic differences between the generations persist for most of the GCs' lifetimes, although the strength of these differences decreases after a few relaxation times. The differences can be seen most clearly in the lowest-mass stars. We find that the GCs' internal angular momentum gradually aligns with the orbital angular momentum, although there is little difference in this alignment between the FG and SG systems. We also find that stars in the GC's outer regions align with the orbital angular momentum vector more rapidly than those in the inner regions leading to a variation of the orientation of the internal angular momentum with the clustercentric distance. The alignment between internal angular momentum and orbital angular momentum occurs more rapidly for low-mass stars. We study the evolution of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution and find the SG to be characterized by a stronger radial anisotropy than the FG.(abridged)</description>

      <title>What is the True HI Gas Content in Massive Quiescent Galaxies in the Local Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While massive quiescent galaxies are known to be poor in atomic hydrogen (HI), their true HI content remains poorly constrained due to the limited sensitivity and morphological biases of existing surveys. We present deep HI observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) for a representative sample of 78 low-redshift massive quiescent galaxies, selected by stellar mass ($M_\ast &gt; 10^{10} M_\odot$) and color (NUV$-r &gt; 5$). Our observations reach an exceptional detection limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) = -3$. We find that one-third of the sample follows the predicted HI mass fraction distribution based on previous surveys. However, the majority ($\sim$2/3) exhibit significantly lower HI content, with a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) &lt; -3.46$ derived from stacking the non-detections. As a consequence of this enormous dynamic range and the high fraction of non-detections, the HI mass fraction shows no clear correlation with parameters tracing star formation, structure, or morphology. Our FAST sample shows remarkable similarity to the $ATLAS^{3D}$ sample which only includes early-type galaxies, both in its high fraction of HI-poor galaxies and its high satellite fraction among HI-poor galaxies, as indicated by three different environmental characteristics: projected cross-correlation functions, background-subtracted neighbour counts, and central/satellite classification in the SDSS galaxy group catalog. These results suggest that while early-type morphology and environment play crucial roles in suppressing HI reservoirs, neither factor alone fully explains the observed gas depletion, indicating that additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the extreme HI deficiency prevalent in massive quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>Evidence for cloud-to-cloud variations in the ratio of polarized thermal dust emission to starlight polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation between optical starlight polarization and polarized thermal dust emission can be used to infer intrinsic dust properties. This correlation is quantified by the ratio Rp/p, which has been measured to be 5.42 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1 at 353 GHz when averaged over large areas of the sky. We investigate this correlation using newly published stellar polarimetric data densely sampling a continuous sky region of ~4 square degrees at intermediate Galactic latitude. We combine RoboPol optical polarization measurements for 1,430 stars with submillimeter data from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz. We perform linear fits between the Planck (Qs, Us) and optical (qv, uv) Stokes parameters, accounting for the differences in resolution between the two datasets as well as the distribution of clouds along the line of sight. We find that in this region of the sky the Rp/p value is 3.67 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1, indicating a significantly shallower slope than that found previously using different stellar samples. We also find significant differences in the fitted slopes when fitting the Qs-qv and Us-uv data separately. We explore two explanations using mock data: miscalibration of polarization angle and variations in Rp/p along the line of sight due to multiple clouds. We show that the former can produce differences in the correlations of Qs-qv and Us-uv, but large miscalibration angles would be needed to reproduce the magnitude of the observed differences. Our simulations favor the interpretation that Rp/p differs between the two dominant clouds that overlap on the sky in this region. The difference in Rp/p suggests that the two clouds may have distinct dust polarimetric properties. With knowledge from the tomographic decomposition of the stellar polarization, we find that one cloud appears to dominate the correlation of Us-uv, while both clouds contribute to the correlation of the Qs-qv data.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Follow-up of Young High-$\alpha$ Dwarf Star Candidates: Still Likely Genuinely Young</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.</description>

      <title>Velocity dispersion profiles of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with self-interacting ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxies provide an excellent laboratory for testing dark matter models at small scale and, in particular, the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) class of models. Within the framework of self-interacting bosonic dark matter, we use the observed velocity-dispersion pro- files of seven dwarf spheroidal galaxies to constrain the parameters of ULDM. In our modeling, we account for the impact of the baryonic component on the velocity dispersion and ULDM halo structure. We find that in the regime of repulsively interacting ULDM, the self-interaction, which fits the observations, is almost negligible, consistent with non-interacting ULDM with a boson mass of approximately 1.6*10^(-22) eV. In contrast, for attractively interacting ULDM, the best fit corre- sponds to a smaller boson mass of about 1.3*10^(-22) eV, with self-interaction playing a significant role in shaping the dark-matter halo and thereby influencing the interpretation of observations.</description>

      <title>Very Massive Stars and High N/O: A Tale of the Nitrogen-enriched Super Star Cluster in the Sunburst Arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lensed Sunburst Arc ($z = 2.369$) hosts a young ($\sim2$--$4\,\rm Myr$), massive ($M_\star \sim 10^7\,M_\odot$), compact ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 8\,\rm pc$) Lyman-continuum (LyC) leaking super star cluster, which powers a compact ($&lt; 10\,\rm pc$), high-pressure nebula at sub-solar metallicity $\sim0.2\,Z_\odot$ and with an anomalously elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio $\log({\rm N/O}) \sim -0.2$. We present semi-analytic models and 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with radiative feedback in an attempt to reproduce this system. The results indicate that the progenitor giant molecular cloud (GMC) may have $M_{\rm cloud} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $R_{\rm cloud} \sim 70\,\rm pc$, corresponding to a surface density $\sim10^3$--$10^4\,M_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$. Incorporating feedback from individual Very Massive Stars (VMSs; $\ge 100\,M_\odot$) sampled from the Kroupa initial mass function, we find that their winds rapidly enrich $\sim 10^4\,M_\odot$ of nearby gas with nitrogen ($\sim 1\,$dex) and helium ($\sim 0.1$--$0.2\,$dex). In the first $1$--$3\,$Myr, some cold gas falls to the system center where a central cluster builds up from sub-cluster mergers. There, the gas is photoionized, pressurized, and chemically enriched by the newly formed VMSs, before being radiatively expelled in the next $\sim1\,\rm Myr$. We find that both VMS feedback and a high-surface-density progenitor GMC are necessary to reproduce the observed nebular properties, such as high N/O, high pressure, and stellar proximity. Low metallicity ($Z \le 0.004$) may be essential to avoid overproduction of carbon from WC stars. Such enrichment processes localized to compact starburst events may have caused strong nitrogen emission from dense ionized gas as observed in high-redshift galaxies such as GN-z11 and GS_3073.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) records the history of galaxy clusters through its complex dynamical properties. To effectively interpret these properties, robust methods are needed to compare observational data with theoretical models. We present a novel machine learning framework for comparing ICM line-of-sight velocity maps derived from X-ray observations. Our approach uses convolutional and Siamese neural networks to identify similarities between different kinematic fields. We outline the architecture of this framework and perform a series of sanity checks to validate its performance. These checks demonstrate the model's ability to correctly identify and quantify kinematic features, establishing a powerful new tool for future comparative studies of the ICM.</description>

      <title>Molecular line emission from 1000 au scales outflows to &lt;30 au compact structures in NGC1333 IRAS4A2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.</description>

      <title>A rising tide: Intrinsic alignments since the turn of the millennium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignments of galaxies across the large-scale structure of the Universe are known to be a source of contamination for gravitational lensing, but they can also probe cosmology and the physics of galaxy evolution in many ways. In this review, I cover developments in our understanding of intrinsic alignments over the past 25 years on: (1) different approaches to model intrinsic alignments across a range of scales, (2) existing observational constraints, (3) predictions from cosmological numerical $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations, (4) mitigation strategies to account for their contamination to lensing observables and (5) cosmological and astrophysical applications. While the review focuses mostly on two-point statistics of intrinsic alignments, I also give a summary of other statistics beyond two-point. Finally, I point out some of the open problems hindering the understanding or application of intrinsic alignments and how they might be overcome in the future.</description>

      <title>The kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich effect as a benchmark for AGN feedback models in hydrodynamical simulations: insights from DESI + ACT</title>

Abstract: Baryonic feedback remains one of the largest uncertainties in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, with different prescriptions producing divergent predictions for the fraction of gas expelled from halos, the radial extent of the gas expulsion and the impact on large scale matter clustering. We present the first systematic study of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect across a wide range of simulations (FLAMINGO, ANTILLES, BAHAMAS, SIMBA, FABLE and their variants), and compare them directly to DESI Year 1 + ACT kSZ measurements. We ensure a like-for-like comparison with observations by developing a robust methodology that accounts for the halo mass selection using galaxy-galaxy lensing, cosmic variance, miscentering and satellites, establishing the kSZ effect as a new benchmark for the simulations. We find that fiducial feedback models are disfavoured by &gt;3 sigma, while simulations with more powerful AGN feedback within the FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS suites, as well as SIMBA, reproduce the observed kSZ signal within &lt;2 sigma. We use the ANTILLES simulation suite to demonstrate that the amplitude of the kSZ effect is a strong predictor of matter power spectrum suppression, competitive with baryon fraction metrics. These results establish the kSZ as a critical probe for evaluating feedback physics and for advancing the fidelity of cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A Tentative Detection of Molecular Hydrogen (H$_2$) Emission Lines at Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for interpreting far-ultraviolet (FUV) fluorescent emission from molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in high-redshift galaxies, motivated by the unique capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to probe the rest frame FUV at cosmic dawn. Using the Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) code, we model the H$_2$ fluorescence spectrum under extreme interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in terms of high pressure ($10^{11}~\mathrm{K~ cm^{-3}}$), high radiation field ($10^6$ $G_0$) combined with low metallicity ($Z = 0.1~Z_\odot$) and high cosmic ionization rate ($\zeta = 10^{-14}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), characteristic of early galaxies. As a case study, we apply this framework to stacked NIRSpec spectra from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) for galaxies at redshifts $z\geq7$. The stacked spectrum exhibits emission features consistent in profile and wavelength with the predicted H$_2$ fluorescence lines, including a blue shift suggestive of an outflow of molecular gas. Although individual features remain below robust detection thresholds, this demonstration illustrates the feasibility of using FUV fluorescence modeling to guide and interpret JWST spectroscopy of the molecular ISM at high redshift. Our framework provides a foundation for future searches for molecular hydrogen emission and the study of galactic feedback processes in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). Active galactic nuclei identification using diffusion-based inpainting of Euclid VIS images</title>

Abstract: Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.</description>

      <title>The MandelZoom project I: modelling black hole accretion through an $\alpha$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While mounting observational evidence suggests that intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) may be important in shaping the properties of dwarf galaxies both at high redshifts and in the local Universe, our theoretical understanding of how these IMBHs grow is largely incomplete. To address this, we perform high-resolution simulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of $10^{10}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ harbouring a $10^4~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ IMBH at its centre at a peak spatial resolution of $\lesssim 0.01$ pc. Within the fully multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), we incorporate explicit sampling of stars from the initial mass function, photo-ionization, photoelectric heating, individual supernovae (SNe), as well as a Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc model to track the evolution of BH mass and spin. We find that a nuclear star cluster (NSC) effectively captures the ISM gas and promotes formation of a circumnuclear disc (CND) on scales of $\lesssim 7$ pc. Simultaneously, gravitational torques from the NSC reduce CND angular momentum on (sub-)parsec scales, circularizing the gas onto the $\alpha$-accretion disc and promoting sustained IMBH growth at $\sim 0.01$ of the Eddington rate. While in the innermost regions ($\lesssim 0.5$ pc), star formation is highly suppressed, the CND is susceptible to fragmentation, leading to the formation of massive, young stars. Interestingly, despite an in-situ SN rate of $0.3~{\rm Myr}^{-1}$, the dense CND persists, sustaining BH accretion and leading to its net spin-up. Our study demonstrates the complexity of IMBH accretion within a multi-phase ISM, and paves the way for next-generation studies where IMBH growth in a fully cosmological context can be captured.</description>

      <title>AllBRICQS: The Discovery of Luminous Quasars in the Northern Hemisphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the second catalog of bright quasars from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$. This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities. AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types, which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of $44.9&lt;\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)&lt;48.0$ at redshifts between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the data.</description>

      <title>The Bigfoot: A footprint of a Coma cluster progenitor at z=3.98</title>

Abstract: Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at $z = 3.98$ including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over $15\times 37$ $\times 49{\rm{cMpc^3}}$ in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (${M_0} &gt; 10^{15} {M_{_ \odot }}$). All subgroups with ${M_{\rm{h}}} &gt; {10^{12.5}}{M_{_ \odot }}$ exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies ($&gt;{10^{10.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (${10^{13.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high ${\sigma _8}$ of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.</description>

      <title>Candidate gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxies in Herschel-ATLAS associated with WISE elliptical counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new and independent methodology for identifying gravitational lens candidates using data from the H-ATLAS and AllWISE surveys. Unlike previous approaches, which are typically biased toward bright, strongly lensed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), our method uncovers fainter systems with lower magnifications. This enables the identification and individual study of lensing events that would otherwise only be accessible through statistical weak lensing analyses. Our approach focuses on high-redshift SMGs from H-ATLAS in the range $1.2 &lt; z &lt; 4.0$, and searches for associated AllWISE sources within an angular distance of 18 arcsec. Candidate lenses are selected based on their WISE colors ($0.5 &lt; \mathrm{W2} - \mathrm{W3} &lt; 1.5$ mag), consistent with those of elliptical galaxies, and further filtered using $J-\mathrm{W1}$ color and photometric redshift cuts to reduce stellar contamination. This conservative selection yields 68 new lens candidates. We then performed SED fitting with CIGALE across UV to submillimeter wavelengths to estimate the physical properties of both the lenses and the background SMGs, and to assess the lensing nature of these candidates. Despite the uncertainties, we were able to constrain key parameters such as stellar and dust masses, infrared luminosities, and star formation rates. In addition, the estimated magnifications for most candidates are modest, consistent with the weak lensing regime ($\mu \simeq 1{-}1.5$), although a few sources may require more precise modeling. Future efforts could refine this methodology to recover potential candidates outside our selection, and high-resolution follow-up observations will be essential to confirm the lensing nature of these sources and to further investigate their physical properties.</description>

      <title>Investigating the influence of radio-faint AGN activity on the infrared-radio correlation of massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that star-forming galaxies (SFGs) exhibit a tight correlation between their radio and infrared emissions, commonly referred to as the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). Recent empirical studies have reported a dependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive galaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less massive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual contamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not captured through "radio-excess" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we aim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio luminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program "AGN-sCAN" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the IRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on low-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations reach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio brightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K. This classification serves as a robust AGN diagnostic, regardless of the host galaxy's star formation rate. We detect four VLBA sources in the deepest regions, which are also the faintest VLBI-detected AGN in SFGs to date. The effective AGN detection rate is 9%, when considering a control sample matched in mass and sensitivity, which is in good agreement with the extrapolation of previous radio AGN number counts. Despite the non-negligible AGN flux contamination (~ 30%) in our individual VLBA detections, we find that the peak of the qIR distribution is completely unaffected by this correction. We conclude that residual AGN contamination from non-radio-excess AGN is unlikely to be the primary driver of the M* - dependent IRRC.</description>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are increasingly being used for cosmological applications such as measuring the Hubble constant and baryon abundance. The increasing number of localized FRBs and precise measurement of dispersion measure (DM) make them a suitable probe for such an approach. We use a sample of 110 localized FRBs as well as a small sub-sample of 24 FRBs with scattering timescale measurements or limits. We infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the DM distribution of the host galaxies simultaneously by fitting our model to the FRB DM measurements. With current data, our results are in agreement with both high and low redshift measurements of $H_0$, obtained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae data respectively. We project that with about 200 localized FRBs, we would be in a position to distinguish between the two scenarios at 4$\sigma$ confidence. In addition, the host DM is expected to be related to star formation in the host galaxy and the stellar age of the progenitors. We show that young progenitors with an age of less than 1 Myr are consistent with our inferred distribution of host DM at 95 percent confidence. These young sources may be associated with long scatter broadening times and large DM from their source environments. Indeed, we find that scatter broadening times of FRBs are inconsistent with the Milky Way ISM, but at the same time, do not appear to be strongly correlated with the FRBs' redshift or with the SFR or stellar mass of their host galaxies. This suggests that scattering is dominated by the immediate environment of the sources.</description>
