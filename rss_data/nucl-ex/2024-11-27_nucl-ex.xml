      <title>Lattice simulation of nucleon distribution and shell closure in the proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si is studied using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with high-fidelity chiral forces. Our results indicate that $^{22}$Si is more tightly bound than $^{20}$Mg, thereby excluding the possibility of two-proton emission. The $Z = 14$ shell closure in $^{22}$Si is supported by the evolution of the $2^+$ state in the neighboring nuclei. We then focus on the charge radius and spatial distribution information of $^{22}$Si, considering the novel phenomena that may emerge due to the small two-proton separation energy and the shell closure. We present the distribution of the $14$ protons and $8$ neutrons obtained from our lattice simulation, revealing insights into the spatial arrangement of the nucleons. Moreover, the spatial localization of the outermost proton and neutron suggests that $^{22}$Si is a doubly magic nucleus. Furthermore, we develop the pinhole method based on the harmonic oscillator basis, which gives insight into the nuclear structure in terms of the shell model picture from lattice simulations. Our calculated occupation numbers support that $Z = 14$ and $N = 8$ are the shell closures and show that the $\pi 1s_{1/2}$ orbital component is minor in $^{22}$Si.</description>

      <title>From existing and new nuclear and astrophysical constraints to stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron-rich dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Determination of the strong coupling constant and the Collins-Soper kernel from the energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have conducted the first simultaneous global fit of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel using the energy-energy correlators (EEC) of $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions in the back-to-back limit. This analysis, based on the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization of EEC at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic ($\rm{N}^{3} \rm{LL}$) accuracy, yields $\alpha_s$ consistent with the world average. We have tested two different parametrizations for the non-perturbative CS kernel and found both to align with results obtained from lattice QCD and fits on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan process.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>
