      <title>Some generalized inequalities in Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [1] investigates advanced connotations of Hardy and Rellich-type inequalities on complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds, delving on deriving inequalities that incorporate poignant weight functions. These inequalities prolongate classical results by providing sharper estimates conforming the geometry and structure of the underlying manifold. We in this paper further extend the inequalities and in due course exhibit them in section [4] in terms of theorems and proofs.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Initial Data Sets with Vanishing Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Special Relativity, massless objects are characterized as either vacuum states or as radiation propagating at the speed of light. This distinction extends to General Relativity for asymptotically flat initial data sets (IDS) \((M^n, g, k)\), where vacuum is represented by slices of Minkowski space, and radiation is modeled by slices of \(pp\)-wave spacetimes. In contrast, we demonstrate that asymptotically hyperboloidal IDS with zero mass must embed isometrically into Minkowski space, with no possible IDS configurations modeling radiation in this setting. Our result holds under the most general assumptions. The proof relies on precise decay estimates for spinors on level sets of spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hessian estimates for Lagrangian mean curvature equation with Lipschitz critical and supercritical phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new strategy to study Lagrangain mean curvature equation on open sets of $\mathbb{R}^{n}(n\geq2)$. By establishing an Allard-type regularity theorem, we obtain an interior Hessian estimate of solutions to this equation with prescribed Lipschitz critical and supercritical phases. Here, our condition on the phases is sharp. The proof heavily relies on geometric measure theory, geometry of Lagrangian graphs, and De Giorgi-Nash-Moser iteration. We expect that the techniques and ideas developed here can be used in some other equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze existence and properties of solutions of two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets with a negative cosmological constant, both on spacelike and characteristic surfaces. A new family of such vacuum, spacelike data parameterised by poles at the conformal boundary at infinity is constructed. We review the notions of global Hamiltonian charges, emphasising the difficulties arising in this dimension, both in a spacelike and characteristic setting. One or two, depending upon the topology, lower bounds for energy in terms of angular momentum, linear momentum, and center of mass are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the counting function of Steklov eigenvalues on compact manifolds with boundary and obtain its upper bound involving the leading term of Weyl's law. Our estimate can be viewed as a weakened version of P\'{o}lya's Conjecture in the Steklov case on general manifolds. As a byproduct, we also obtain a description about the decay behavior of Steklov eigenfunctions near the boundary.</description>

      <title>Planar vector fields in the kernel of a 1--form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify, up to a natural equivalence relation, vector fields of the plane which belong to the kernel of a 1--form. This form can be closed, in which case the vector fields are integrable, or not, in which case the differential of the form defines a, possibly singular, symplectic form. In every case, we provide a fairly complete list of local models for such fields and construct their transversal unfoldings. Thus, the local bifurcations of vector fields of interest can be studied, among them being the integrable fields of the plane.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Complex Structures for the Full Quantum Flag Manifold of Quantum SU(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, Lusztig's positive root vectors (with respect to a distinguished choice of reduced decomposition of the longest element of the Weyl group) were shown to give a quantum tangent space for every $A$-series Drinfeld--Jimbo full quantum flag manifold $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{F}_n)$. Moreover, the associated differential calculus $\Omega^{(0,\bullet)}_q(\mathrm{F}_n)$ was shown to have classical dimension, giving a direct $q$-deformation of the classical anti-holomorphic Dolbeault complex of $\mathrm{F}_n$. Here we examine in detail the rank two case, namely the full quantum flag manifold of $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{SU}_3)$. In particular, we examine the $*$-differential calculus associated to $\Omega^{(0,\bullet)}_q(\mathrm{F}_3)$ and its non-commutative complex geometry. We find that the number of almost-complex structures reduces from $8$ (that is $2$ to the power of the number of positive roots of $\frak{sl}_3$) to $4$ (that is $2$ to the power of the number of simple roots of $\frak{sl}_3$). Moreover, we show that each of these almost-complex structures is integrable, which is to say, each of them is a complex structure. Finally, we observe that, due to non-centrality of all the non-degenerate coinvariant $2$-forms, none of these complex structures admits a left $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{SU}_3)$-covariant noncommutative K\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Hermitian structures on a class of quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any quaternionic K\"ahler manifold $(\bar N,g_{\bar N},\mathcal Q)$ equipped with a Killing vector field $X$ with nowhere vanishing quaternionic moment map carries an integrable almost complex structure $J_1$ that is a section of the quaternionic structure $\mathcal Q$. Using the HK/QK correspondence, we study properties of the almost Hermitian structure $(g_{\bar N},\tilde J_1)$ obtained by changing the sign of $J_1$ on the distribution spanned by $X$ and $J_1X$. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for its integrability and for it being conformally K\"ahler. We show that for a large class of quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds containing the one-loop deformed c-map spaces, the structure $\tilde J_1$ is integrable. We do also show that the integrability of $\tilde J_1$ implies that $(g_{\bar N},\tilde J_1)$ is conformally K\"ahler in dimension four, but not in higher dimensions. In the special case of the one-loop deformation of the quaternionic K\"ahler symmetric spaces dual to the complex Grassmannians of two-planes we construct a third canonical Hermitian structure $(g_{\bar N},\hat J_1)$. Finally, we give a complete local classification of quaternionic K\"ahler four-folds for which $\tilde J_1$ is integrable and show that these are either locally symmetric or carry a cohomogeneity $1$ isometric action generated by one of the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{o}(2)\ltimes\mathfrak{heis}_3(\mathbb R)$, $\mathfrak{u}(2)$, or $\mathfrak{u}(1,1)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a closed, oriented four-manifold containing an embedded sphere with self-intersection number $(-1)$. Suppose that $b_2^+(X) \leq 3$. We show that there exists a Riemannian metric on $X$ such that the cohomology class dual to this sphere is represented by an anti-self-dual harmonic form. Furthermore, such a metric can be constructed even when there are multiple disjoint embedded $(-1)$-spheres.</description>

      <title>On the Multiplicity One Conjecture for Mean Curvature Flows of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Multiplicity One Conjecture for mean curvature flows of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, we show that any blow-up limit of such mean curvature flows has multiplicity one. This has several applications. First, combining our work with results of Brendle and Choi-Haslhofer-Hershkovits-White, we show that any level set flow starting from an embedded surface diffeomorphic to a 2-spheres does not fatten. In fact, we obtain that the problem of evolving embedded 2-spheres via the mean curvature flow equation is well-posed within a natural class of singular solutions. Second, we use our result to remove an additional condition in recent work of Chodosh-Choi-Mantoulidis-Schulze. This shows that mean curvature flows starting from any generic embedded surface only incur cylindrical or spherical singularities. Third, our approach offers a new regularity theory for solutions of mean curvature flows that flow through singularities. Among other things, this theory also applies to the innermost and outermost flow of any embedded surface and shows that all singularity models of such flows must have multiplicity one. It also establishes equality of the fattening time with the discrepancy time. Lastly, we obtain a number of further results characterizing a separation phenomenon of mean curvature flows of surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $n$ be an integer with $3 \leq n \leq 7$, and let $g$ be a Riemannian metric on $B^2 \times T^{n-2}$ with scalar curvature at least $-n(n-1)$. We establish an inequality relating the systole of the boundary to the infimum of the mean curvature on the boundary. As a consequence, we obtain a new positive energy theorem where equality holds for the Horowitz-Myers metrics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative tightness for three-dimensional contact manifolds: a sub-Riemannian approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the use of sub-Riemannian metrics we provide quantitative estimates for the maximal tight neighbourhood of a Reeb orbit on a three-dimensional contact manifold. Under appropriate geometric conditions we show how to construct closed curves which are boundaries of overtwisted disks. We introduce the concept of contact Jacobi curve, and prove lower bounds of the so-called tightness radius (from a Reeb orbit) in terms of Schwarzian derivative bounds. We compare these results with the corresponding ones from [Etnyre, Komendarczyk, Massot - Invent. Math. 2012 and Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2016], and we show that our estimates are sharp for classical model structures. We also prove similar, but non-sharp, estimates in terms of sub-Riemannian canonical curvature bounds. We apply our results to K-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds. In this setting, we prove a contact analogue of the celebrated Cartan-Hadamard theorem.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sard's theorem asserts that the set of critical values of a smooth map from one Euclidean space to another one has measure zero. A version of this result for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Smale for maps with Fredholm differential. It is well-known, however, that when the domain is infinite dimensional and the range is finite dimensional, the result is not true -- even under the assumption that the map is ``polynomial'' -- and a general theory is still lacking. Addressing this issue, in this paper, we provide sharp quantitative criteria for the validity of Sard's theorem in this setting. Our motivation comes from sub-Riemannian geometry and, as an application of our results, we prove the sub-Riemannian Sard conjecture for the restriction of the Endpoint map of Carnot groups to the set of piece-wise real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence, and the strong Sard conjecture for the restriction to the set of piece-wise entire controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\overline{X}$ be the toroidal compactification of a cusped complex hyperbolic manifold $X=\mathbb{B}^n/\Gamma$ with the boundary divisor $D=\overline{X}\setminus X$. The main goal of this paper is to find the positivity properties of $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}$ and $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big)$ depending intrinsically on $X$. We prove that $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big) \langle -r D \rangle$ is ample for all sufficiently small rational numbers $r &gt;0$, and $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big)$ is ample modulo $D.$ Further, we conclude that if the cusps of $X$ have uniform depth greater than $4\pi$, then $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}$ is semi-ample and is ample modulo $D$, all subvarieties of $X$ are of general type, and every smooth subvariety $V\subset \overline{X}$ intersecting $\overline{X}$ has ample $K_{V}$. Finally, we show that the minimum volume of subvarieties of $\overline{X}$ intersecting both $X$ and $D$ tends to infinity in towers of normal covering of $X.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies some bounded conditions on curvature tensors. First, we use the $L^p-L^q$-dipsersive and smoothing estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the previous ones \cite{Xuan2022,Xuan2023} to the generalized non-compact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetry groups and winding numbers of planar curves obtained as images of weighted sums of exponentials. More generally, we study the image of the complex unit circle under a finite or infinite Laurent series using a particular parametrization of the circle. We generalize various previous results on such sums of exponentials and relate them to other classes of curves present in the literature. Moreover, we consider the evolution under the wave equation of such curves for the case of binomials. Interestingly, our methods provide a unified and systematic way of constructing curves with prescribed properties, such as the number of cusps, the number of intersection points or the winding number.</description>
