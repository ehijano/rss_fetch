      <title>The Hubble parameter of the Local Distance Ladder from dynamical dark energy with no free parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our cosmology contains Big Bang relic fluctuations by a loss of time-translation symmetry on a Hubble time scale. The contribution to the vacuum is identified with dynamical dark energy $\Lambda\simeq \alpha_p\Lambda_0$ by an IR coupling $\alpha_p\sim \hbar$ of the bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_0\sim\hbar^{-1}$ consistent with general relativity, where $\hbar$ is the Planck constant. Described by the trace $J=(1-q)H^2$ of the Schouten tensor derived from a path integral formulation with gauged global phase, the proposed $J$CDM takes us beyond the $\Lambda$CDM limit of frozen $J=\Lambda$. The Hubble constant $H_0$ in $J$CDM is effectively $\sqrt{6/5}$ times the {\em Planck} value in $\Lambda$CDM analysis of the CMB according to $H(z)=H_0\sqrt{1+(6/5)\Omega_{M,0} Z_5(z) + \Omega_{r,0}Z_6(z)}/(1+z)$, where $Z_n=(1+z)^n-1$ given densities of matter $\Omega_{M,0}$ and radiation $\Omega_{r,0}$. With no free parameters, $J$CDM hereby agrees with the Local Distance Ladder when satisfying the BAO measured by {\em Planck}. On this cosmological background, galaxies possess an essentially $C^0$-transition to anomalous dynamics due to reduced inertia below the de Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $c$ is the velocity of light. This is confirmed in SPARC over a 6$\sigma$ tension in $\Lambda$CDM galaxy models, pointing to ultra-light CDM of mass $m_Dc^2&lt;3\times 10^{-21}$eV. Sensitivity to this cosmological background explains the JWST 'Impossible galaxies' at cosmic dawn by rapid gravitational collapse. We comment on an outlook on future confrontations with observations by {\em Euclid}.</description>

      <title>Bending the web: exploring the impact of modified gravity on the density field and halo properties within the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of different Modified Gravity (MG) models on the large-scale structures (LSS) properties in relation to the cosmic web (CW), using N-body simulations of f(R) and nDGP models. We analyse the impact of the MG effect on the density field through density distribution and clustering statistics, and assess its influence on halo properties by examining the halo mass function and spin. We find that the PDF of dark matter density fields shift towards lower densities for stronger variants of f(R) and nDGP. Additionally, when segregated into CW environments, the stronger variants show a higher mean density in knots, and a lower mean density in voids compared to LCDM. For higher-order clustering statistics relative to LCDM, the scale-dependent f(R) variants exhibit a greater non-monotonic deviation as a function of scale when segregated into environments, compared to nDGP. Additionally, the halo mass function separated into CW environments shows a similar behaviour, introducing complex trends as a function of mass for f(R) and nDGP models. We also report up to a 15% enhancement in the angular momentum of halos in f(R) gravity models compared to LCDM, with similar differences when considering environmental segregation. We demonstrate that this difference in the spin arises largely due to different tidal torquing across the various MG models. Therefore, studying higher-order statistics of the cosmological fields and halo properties separated into CW components probes the additional physics contained within the MG models. We conclude that considering the effect of CW in MG studies increases the constraining power of these LSS statistics, and can further aid the distinction between the cosmologies that have an identical expansion history to the standard LCDM but differing underlying physics, such as the MG models presented in this work.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Misaligned Ultralight Dark Matter and Implications for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the possibility that dark matter (DM) may be an ultralight scalar that was misaligned via non-minimal coupling to gravity, in the early Universe. For a certain regime of scalar masses, gravitational effects in neutron stars could place interesting bounds on the viable parameter space of the model, even in the absence of non-gravitational interactions between DM and ordinary matter.</description>

      <title>NEXUS: the North ecliptic pole EXtragalactic Unified Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NEXUS is a JWST Multi-Cycle (Cycles 3-5; 368 primary hrs) GO Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey around the North Ecliptic Pole. It contains two overlapping tiers. The Wide tier ($\sim 400~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs NIRCam/WFSS 2.4-5 micron grism spectroscopy with three epochs over 3 years (final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel&gt;3}$ at F444W$&lt;22.2$). The Deep tier ($\sim 50~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs high-multiplexing NIRSpec 0.6-5.3 micron MOS/PRISM spectroscopy for $\sim 10,000$ targets, over 18 epochs with a 2-month cadence (epoch/final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel&gt;3}$ at F200W$\lesssim 27/29$). All epochs have simultaneous multi-band NIRCam and MIRI imaging ($5\sigma$ final depths of $\sim 28-29$ in NIRCam and $\sim 25$ in MIRI). The field is within the continuous viewing zone of JWST, and is fully covered by the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field, with 0.9-2 micron deep Euclid spectroscopy and cadenced photometry. NEXUS has three science pillars. First, with its massive and nearly complete (flux-limited) spectroscopic samples and deep photometry, it will perform efficient classification and physical characterization of galaxies and AGNs from $z\sim 1$ to Cosmic Dawn. With the large contiguous area coverage, it will measure the spatial clustering and demography of the first galaxies and SMBHs at $z&gt;6$. Second, multi-epoch observations enable systematic time-domain investigations, focusing on $z&gt;3$ transients and low-mass AGN reverberation mapping. Third, the comprehensive data set will enable knowledge transfer to other legacy fields, create data challenges, and initiate benchmark work for future space missions. With rapid public releases of processed data and an open invitation for collaboration, NEXUS aims for broad and swift community engagement, to become a powerhouse to drive transformative advancements in multiple key science areas of astronomy.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe to study cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were suggested, and some tight empirical relations have been found for them. In particular, Guo and Wei suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young populations, which have also some new empirical relations. They also proposed to use one of the empirical relations without dispersion measure (DM) to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. Thus, it is time to check the empirical relations with the current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmology from double field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy limit of string theory contains additional gravitational degrees of freedom, a skew-symmetric tensor $B$-field and a scalar dilaton, that are not present in general relativity. Together with the metric, these three fields are naturally embedded in the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric framework of double field theory. The $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry uniquely prescribes the interactions between the extended gravitational sector and other matter, leading to novel features beyond conventional string cosmology. In this work we present the equations of motion for linear perturbations around $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmological backgrounds in $D=4$ under a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We obtain analytic solutions in the superhorizon limit for scalar perturbations around various homogeneous and isotropic background solutions, including some candidate models for bouncing cosmologies. The generalized energy-momentum tensor includes source terms for the $B$-field and dilaton, and we show how the resulting generalized conservation laws modify the conditions for conservation of curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Sensitive 3mm Imaging of Discrete Sources in the Fields of tSZ-Selected Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the results of a blind survey for compact sources in 243 Galaxy clusters that were identified using the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (tSZ). The survey was carried out at 90 GHz using MUSTANG2 on the Green Bank telescope and achieved a $5\sigma$ detection limit of 1 mJy in the center of each cluster. We detected 24 discrete sources. The majority (18) of these correspond to known radio sources, and of these, 5 show signs of significant variability, either with time or in spectral index. The remaining sources have no clear counterparts at other wavelengths. Searches for galaxy clusters via the tSZ effect strongly rely on observations at 90 GHz, and the sources found have the potential to bias mass estimates of clusters. We compare our results to the simulation Websky that can be used to estimate the source contamination in galaxy cluster catalogs. While the simulation showed a good match to our observations at the clusters' centers, it does not match our source distribution further out. Sources over 104" from a cluster's center bias the tSZ signal high, for some of our sources, by over 50%. When averaged over the whole cluster population the effect is smaller but still at a level of 1 to 2%. We also discovered that unlike previous measurements and simulations we see an enhancement of source counts in the outer regions of the clusters and fewer sources than expected in the centers of this tSZ selected sample.</description>

      <title>No need to know: astrophysics-free gravitational-wave cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact objects encode direct information about the luminosity distance to the binary. When paired with a redshift measurement, this enables standard-siren cosmology: a Hubble diagram can be constructed to directly probe the Universe's expansion. This can be done in the absence of electromagnetic measurements as features in the mass distribution of GW sources provide self-calibrating redshift measurements without the need for a definite or probabilistic host galaxy association. This ``spectral siren'' technique has thus far only been applied with simple parametric representations of the mass distribution, and theoretical predictions for features in the mass distribution are commonly presumed to be fundamental to the measurement. However, the use of an inaccurate representation leads to biases in the cosmological inference, an acute problem given the current theoretical uncertainties in the population. Here, we demonstrate that spectral sirens can accurately infer cosmological parameters without prior assumptions for the shape of the mass distribution. We apply a flexible, non-parametric model for the mass distribution of compact binaries to a simulated catalog of 1,000 GW events, consistent with expectations for the next LVK observing run. We find that, despite our model's flexibility, both the source mass model and cosmological parameters are correctly reconstructed. We predict a $5.8\%$ measurement of $H_0$, keeping all other cosmological parameters fixed, and a $6.4\%$ measurement of $H(z=0.9)$ when fitting for multiple cosmological parameters ($1\sigma$ uncertainties). This astrophysically-agnostic spectral siren technique will be essential to arrive at precise and unbiased cosmological constraints from GW source populations.</description>

      <title>Impact of lensing of gravitational waves on the observed distribution of neutron star masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of masses of neutron stars, particularly the maximum mass value, is considered a probe of their formation, evolution and internal physics (i.e., equation of state). This mass distribution could in principle be inferred from the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers. Using mock catalogues of $10^5$ dark sirens events, expected to be detected by Einstein Telescope over an operational period of $\sim1\, \rm year$ , we show how the biased luminosity distance measurement induced by gravitational lensing affects the inferred redshift and mass of the merger. This results in higher observed masses than expected. Up to $2\%$ of the events are predicted to fall above the maximum allowed neutron star mass depending on the intrinsic mass distribution and signal-to-noise ratio threshold adopted. The underlying true mass distribution and maximum mass could still be approximately recovered in the case of bright standard sirens.</description>

      <title>Litmus tests of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and model-independent measurement of $H_0r_\mathrm{d}$ with LSST and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this analysis we apply a model-independent framework to test the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology using simulated SNIa data from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and combined with simulated Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) five-years Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. We adopt an iterative smoothing technique to reconstruct the expansion history from SNIa data, which, when combined with BAO measurements, facilitates a comprehensive test of the Universe's curvature and the nature of dark energy. The analysis is conducted under three different mock true cosmologies: a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe, a universe with a notable curvature ($\Omega_{k,0} = 0.1$), and one with dynamically evolving dark energy. Each cosmology demonstrates different kinds and varying degrees of deviation from the standard model predictions. We forecast that our reconstruction technique can constrain cosmological parameters, such as the curvature ($\Omega_{k,0}$) and $c/H_0 r_\mathrm{d}$, with a precision of approximately 0.5\% for $c/H_0r_\mathrm{d}$ and 0.04 for $\Omega_{k,0}$, competitive with current cosmic microwave background constraints, without assuming any form of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new picture of the early universe in finite nonlocal quantum gravity, which is Weyl invariant at the classical and quantum levels. The high-energy regime of the theory consists of two phases, a Weyl invariant trans-Planckian phase and a post-Planckian or Higgs phase described by an action quadratic in the Ricci tensor and where the cosmos evolves according to the standard radiation-dominated model. In the first phase, all the issues of the hot big bang such as the singularity, flatness, and horizon problems find a universal and simple non-inflationary solution by means of Weyl invariance, regardless of the microscopic details of the theory. In the second phase, once Weyl symmetry is spontaneously broken, primordial perturbations are generated around a background that asymptotically evolves as a radiation-dominated flat Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker universe.</description>

      <title>JADES. The diverse population of infant Black Holes at 4&lt;z&lt;11: merging, tiny, poor, but mighty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 12 new AGN at 4&lt;z&lt;7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in Halpha. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs). The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation, and even approaching M_BH~Mstar, as expected for DCBHs and super-Eddington scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN &gt; 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is &gt; 10%.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Evaporation with Large Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectra of gravitational waves from black hole evaporation generically peak at frequencies of order the Hawking temperature, making this signal ultra-high frequency for primordial black holes evaporating in the early universe. This motivates us to consider small black holes in theories with large extra dimensions, for which the peak frequency can be lowered substantially, since the true bulk Planck scale $M_*$ can be much smaller than the effective $M_{\rm Pl}$. We study the emission of brane-localized gravitons during the Hawking evaporation of ultra-light primordial black holes in the context of theories with large extra dimensions, with the ultimate goal of computing the contribution to the stochastic gravitational wave background. To accurately model black hole evolution, we compute greybody factors for particles of spin-0, 1/2, 1, and 2 emitted on the brane and in the bulk, presuming the majority of emission proceeds during the Schwarzschild phase. We then compute the power spectrum and present day spectral density parameter for brane-localized gravitons contributing to a gravitational wave signal. We find that for an optimal choice of parameters, the peak frequency plateaus in the sub-MHz regime, within range of planned high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, making this scenario a target for detection once their sensitivity exceeds $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational waves to see the first second of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The Valuable Long-period Cluster Cepheid KQ Scorpii and other Calibration Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (\citealt{lin21} DR3 corrections applied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where consensus exists.</description>

      <title>Interpretating Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>
