      <title>ConCLVD: Controllable Chinese Landscape Video Generation via Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese landscape painting is a gem of Chinese cultural and artistic heritage that showcases the splendor of nature through the deep observations and imaginations of its painters. Limited by traditional techniques, these artworks were confined to static imagery in ancient times, leaving the dynamism of landscapes and the subtleties of artistic sentiment to the viewer's imagination. Recently, emerging text-to-video (T2V) diffusion methods have shown significant promise in video generation, providing hope for the creation of dynamic Chinese landscape paintings. However, challenges such as the lack of specific datasets, the intricacy of artistic styles, and the creation of extensive, high-quality videos pose difficulties for these models in generating Chinese landscape painting videos. In this paper, we propose CLV-HD (Chinese Landscape Video-High Definition), a novel T2V dataset for Chinese landscape painting videos, and ConCLVD (Controllable Chinese Landscape Video Diffusion), a T2V model that utilizes Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we present a motion module featuring a dual attention mechanism to capture the dynamic transformations of landscape imageries, alongside a noise adapter to leverage unsupervised contrastive learning in the latent space. Following the generation of keyframes, we employ optical flow for frame interpolation to enhance video smoothness. Our method not only retains the essence of the landscape painting imageries but also achieves dynamic transitions, significantly advancing the field of artistic video generation.

      <title>MindTuner: Cross-Subject Visual Decoding with Visual Fingerprint and Semantic Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding natural visual scenes from brain activity has flourished, with extensive research in single-subject tasks and, however, less in cross-subject tasks. Reconstructing high-quality images in cross-subject tasks is a challenging problem due to profound individual differences between subjects and the scarcity of data annotation. In this work, we proposed MindTuner for cross-subject visual decoding, which achieves high-quality and rich-semantic reconstructions using only 1 hour of fMRI training data benefiting from the phenomena of visual fingerprint in the human visual system and a novel fMRI-to-text alignment paradigm. Firstly, we pre-train a multi-subject model among 7 subjects and fine-tune it with scarce data on new subjects, where LoRAs with Skip-LoRAs are utilized to learn the visual fingerprint. Then, we take the image modality as the intermediate pivot modality to achieve fMRI-to-text alignment, which achieves impressive fMRI-to-text retrieval performance and corrects fMRI-to-image reconstruction with fine-tuned semantics. The results of both qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that MindTuner surpasses state-of-the-art cross-subject visual decoding models on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), whether using training data of 1 hour or 40 hours.</description>

      <title>Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of visual cues has revitalized the performance of the target speech extraction task, elevating it to the forefront of the field. Nevertheless, this multi-modal learning paradigm often encounters the challenge of modality imbalance. In audio-visual target speech extraction tasks, the audio modality tends to dominate, potentially overshadowing the importance of visual guidance. To tackle this issue, we propose AVSepChain, drawing inspiration from the speech chain concept. Our approach partitions the audio-visual target speech extraction task into two stages: speech perception and speech production. In the speech perception stage, audio serves as the dominant modality, while visual information acts as the conditional modality. Conversely, in the speech production stage, the roles are reversed. This transformation of modality status aims to alleviate the problem of modality imbalance. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive semantic matching loss to ensure that the semantic information conveyed by the generated speech aligns with the semantic information conveyed by lip movements during the speech production stage. Through extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets for audio-visual target speech extraction, we showcase the superior performance achieved by our proposed method.</description>

      <title>MambaMOS: LiDAR-based 3D Moving Object Segmentation with Motion-aware State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based Moving Object Segmentation (MOS) aims to locate and segment moving objects in point clouds of the current scan using motion information from previous scans. Despite the promising results achieved by previous MOS methods, several key issues, such as the weak coupling of temporal and spatial information, still need further study. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D Moving Object Segmentation with Motion-aware State Space Model, termed MambaMOS. Firstly, we develop a novel embedding module, the Time Clue Bootstrapping Embedding (TCBE), to enhance the coupling of temporal and spatial information in point clouds and alleviate the issue of overlooked temporal clues. Secondly, we introduce the Motion-aware State Space Model (MSSM) to endow the model with the capacity to understand the temporal correlations of the same object across different time steps. Specifically, MSSM emphasizes the motion states of the same object at different time steps through two distinct temporal modeling and correlation steps. We utilize an improved state space model to represent these motion differences, significantly modeling the motion states. Finally, extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI-MOS and KITTI-Road benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MambaMOS achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code of this work will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Terminal-K/MambaMOS.</description>

      <title>Training-and-prompt-free General Painterly Harmonization Using Image-wise Attention Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Painterly Image Harmonization aims at seamlessly blending disparate visual elements within a single coherent image. However, previous approaches often encounter significant limitations due to training data constraints, the need for time-consuming fine-tuning, or reliance on additional prompts. To surmount these hurdles, we design a Training-and-prompt-Free General Painterly Harmonization method using image-wise attention sharing (TF-GPH), which integrates a novel "share-attention module". This module redefines the traditional self-attention mechanism by allowing for comprehensive image-wise attention, facilitating the use of a state-of-the-art pretrained latent diffusion model without the typical training data limitations. Additionally, we further introduce "similarity reweighting" mechanism enhances performance by effectively harnessing cross-image information, surpassing the capabilities of fine-tuning or prompt-based approaches. At last, we recognize the deficiencies in existing benchmarks and propose the "General Painterly Harmonization Benchmark", which employs range-based evaluation metrics to more accurately reflect real-world application. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy of our method across various benchmarks. The code and web demo are available at https://github.com/BlueDyee/TF-GPH.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Automatic Personalised Nutrition: Food Image Recognition Benchmark and Dataset based on Nutrition Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle has become increasingly challenging in today's sedentary society marked by poor eating habits. To address this issue, both national and international organisations have made numerous efforts to promote healthier diets and increased physical activity. However, implementing these recommendations in daily life can be difficult, as they are often generic and not tailored to individuals. This study presents the AI4Food-NutritionDB database, the first nutrition database that incorporates food images and a nutrition taxonomy based on recommendations by national and international health authorities. The database offers a multi-level categorisation, comprising 6 nutritional levels, 19 main categories (e.g., "Meat"), 73 subcategories (e.g., "White Meat"), and 893 specific food products (e.g., "Chicken"). The AI4Food-NutritionDB opens the doors to new food computing approaches in terms of food intake frequency, quality, and categorisation. Also, we present a standardised experimental protocol and benchmark including three tasks based on the nutrition taxonomy (i.e., category, subcategory, and final product recognition). These resources are available to the research community, including our deep learning models trained on AI4Food-NutritionDB, which can serve as pre-trained models, achieving accurate recognition results for challenging food image databases.</description>

      <title>A multi-modal approach for identifying schizophrenia using cross-modal attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on how different modalities of human communication can be used to distinguish between healthy controls and subjects with schizophrenia who exhibit strong positive symptoms. We developed a multi-modal schizophrenia classification system using audio, video, and text. Facial action units and vocal tract variables were extracted as low-level features from video and audio respectively, which were then used to compute high-level coordination features that served as the inputs to the audio and video modalities. Context-independent text embeddings extracted from transcriptions of speech were used as the input for the text modality. The multi-modal system is developed by fusing a segment-to-session-level classifier for video and audio modalities with a text model based on a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) with cross-modal attention. The proposed multi-modal system outperforms the previous state-of-the-art multi-modal system by 8.53% in the weighted average F1 score.</description>

      <title>MART: Learning Hierarchical Music Audio Representations with Part-Whole Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research in self-supervised contrastive learning of music representations has demonstrated remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks. However, a prevailing trend in existing methods involves representing equally-sized music clips in either waveform or spectrogram formats, often overlooking the intrinsic part-whole hierarchies within music. In our quest to comprehend the bottom-up structure of music, we introduce MART, a hierarchical music representation learning approach that facilitates feature interactions among cropped music clips while considering their part-whole hierarchies. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical part-whole transformer to capture the structural relationships between music clips in a part-whole hierarchy. Furthermore, a hierarchical contrastive learning objective is crafted to align part-whole music representations at adjacent levels, progressively establishing a multi-hierarchy representation space. The effectiveness of our music representation learning from part-whole hierarchies has been empirically validated across multiple downstream tasks, including music classification and cover song identification.</description>
