      <title>Starfield: Demand-Aware Satellite Topology Design for Low-Earth Orbit Mega Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations are emerging as high-capacity backbones for next-generation Internet. Deployment of laser terminals enables high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite links (ISLs); however, their limited number, slow acquisition, and instability make forming a stable satellite topology difficult. Existing patterns like +Grid and Motif ignore regional traffic, ground station placement, and constellation geometry. Given sparse population distribution on Earth and the isolation of rural areas, traffic patterns are inherently non-uniform, providing an opportunity to orient inter-satellite links (ISLs) according to these traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose Starfield, a novel demand-aware satellite topology design heuristic algorithm supported by mathematical analysis. We first formulate a vector field on the constellation's shell according to traffic flows and define a corresponding Riemannian metric on the spherical manifold of the shell. The metric, combined with the spatial geometry, is used to assign a distance to each potential ISL, which we then aggregate over all demand flows to generate a heuristic for each satellite's link selection. Inspired by +Grid, each satellite selects the link with the minimum Riemannian heuristic along with its corresponding angular links. To evaluate Starfield, we developed a custom, link-aware, and link-configurable packet-level simulator, comparing it against +Grid and Random topologies. For the Phase 1 Starlink, simulation results show up to a 30% reduction in hop count and a 15% improvement in stretch factor across multiple traffic distributions. Moreover, static Starfield, an inter-orbital link matching modification of Starfield, achieves a 20% improvement in stretch factor under realistic traffic patterns compared to +Grid. Experiments further demonstrate Starfield's robustness under traffic demand perturbations.</description>

      <title>SDN-Driven Innovations in MANETs and IoT: A Path to Smarter Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Internet of Things (IoT) networks operate in decentralized and dynamic environments, making them ideal for scenarios lacking traditional infrastructure. However, these networks face challenges such as inefficient routing, limited scalability, and security vulnerabilities due to their decentralized nature and resource constraints. This paper explores the integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) as a unified solution that leverages its centralized control and network programmability to improve routing, resource management, and security. A mathematical model evaluates the impact of SDN integration on Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), Operational Expenditure (OPEX), and performance metrics. Results demonstrate that SDN-enhanced MANETs and IoT networks offer superior scalability, reduced latency, increased throughput, and lower packet loss, especially in dynamic and large-scale environments. While SDN introduces computational overhead, it significantly enhances routing efficiency, resource optimization, and adaptability. The proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution, enabling the development of network architectures that efficiently manage growing node densities, dynamic topologies, and high data traffic. This approach ensures resilience, making it well-suited to meet the performance and reliability demands of modern, large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) with Software-Defined Networking (SDN): A Balanced Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are decentralized wireless networks, characterized by their dynamic topologies and node mobility. In the era of cutting-edge technologies, integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with MANETs offers a promising solution to manage these challenges more efficiently. This paper presents a balanced discussion of MANETs and SDN, demonstrating how SDN principles, such as centralized control and network virtualization, can optimize MANET performance in terms of scalability, cost-efficiency, and security. A mathematical model is developed to analyze Capital Expenditures (CAPEX), Operational Expenditures (OPEX), and network efficiency.</description>

      <title>A user subscription model in mobile radio access networks with network slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing is an architectural enabling technology that logically decouples the current cellular networks into infrastructure providers (InPs) and Network Slice Tenants (NSTs). The network resources (e.g., radio access resources at each cell) are owned by the InP, and are shared by the NSTs to provide a service to their mobile users. In this context, we proposed a business model that includes resource allocation and user subscription to NSTs in a competitive setting, and provides, among other things, closed-form expressions for the subscription indicators in equilibrium of each NST at each cell. This model relies on the widely adopted logit model to characterize user subscriptions. However, as a consequence of user mobility and radio propagation, some of the underlying assumptions in the logit model do not hold. Therefore, further research is needed to assess the accuracy of the results provided by the logit model in a mobile radio scenario. We carry out a thorough evaluation of the validity of the model by comparing its results against those obtained through computer simulation. Our simulation model includes complete and realistic characterizations of user mobility and radio propagation. From the results, we conclude in most cases the logit model provides valid results in a mobile radio scenario.</description>

      <title>A Novel Contrastive Loss for Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in network intrusion detection; however, its performance significantly degrades when confronted by a new attack class -- a zero-day attack. In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Bias in the Shadows: Explore Shortcuts in Encrypted Network Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.
  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.</description>

      <title>Queueing-Aware Optimization of Reasoning Tokens for Accuracy-Latency Trade-offs in LLM Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.</description>

      <title>SCRamble: Adaptive Decentralized Overlay Construction for Blockchain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being under development for over 15 years, transaction throughput remains one of the key challenges confronting blockchains, which typically has a cap of a limited number of transactions per second. A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the network latency associated with the block propagation throughout of the underlying peer-to-peer network, typically formed through random connections. Accelerating the dissemination of blocks not only improves transaction rates, but also enhances system security by reducing the probability of forks. This paper introduces SCRamble: a decentralized protocol that significantly reduces block dissemination time in blockchain networks. SCRamble's effectiveness is attributed to its innovative link selection strategy, which integrates two heuristics: a scoring mechanism that assesses block arrival times from neighboring peers, and a second heuristic that takes network latency into account.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Storage-Bandwidth Tradeoff in Distributed Storage with Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.</description>

      <title>NFV Platform Design: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.11059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the intrinsically inefficient service provisioning in traditional networks, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) keeps gaining attention from both industry and academia. By replacing the purpose-built, expensive, proprietary network equipment with software network functions consolidated on commodity hardware, NFV envisions a shift towards a more agile and open service provisioning paradigm with much lower capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx). Nonetheless, just like any complex system, NFV platforms commonly consist of abounding software and hardware components and usually incorporate disparate design choices based on distinct motivations or use cases. This broad collection of convoluted alternatives makes it extremely arduous for network operators to make proper choices. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to investigating different aspects of NFV, none of them specifically focused on NFV platforms or attempted to explore the design space. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on NFV platform design. Our study solely targets existing NFV platform implementations. We begin with an architectural view of the standard reference NFV platform and present our taxonomy of existing NFV platforms based on the principal purpose of design. Then we thoroughly explore the design space and elaborate on the implementation choices each platform opts for. We believe that our study gives a detailed guideline for network operators or service providers to choose or implement the most appropriate NFV platforms based on their respective requirements. Note that this report serves as a complementary document for a published IEEE TNSM paper [1]. We will periodically update this document to include the newly proposed NFV platforms and design choices.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16821v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating Large AI Models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks is a key enabler of the AI-Native Air Interface (AI-AI), where protocol intelligence must scale beyond handcrafted logic. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first standards-compliant emulation of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer using a decoder-only LAM (LLAMA-class) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a multi-vendor corpus of real-world traces spanning both 5G and 4G systems. We treat RRC as a domain-specific language and construct a segmentation-safe, question-answer (Question-and-Answer (QA)) dataset that preserves Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) structure through linearization prior to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. The proposed approach combines parameter-efficient adaptation with schema-bounded prompting to ensure syntactic and procedural fidelity. Evaluation introduces a standards-aware triad -- ASN.1 conformance, field-level coverage analysis, and uplink-to-downlink state-machine checks -- alongside semantic similarity and latency profiling across 120 configurations. On 30k 5G request-response pairs plus an additional 4.8k QA turns from 4G sessions, our 8B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97, a 61% relative gain over a zero-shot baseline, while sustaining high conformance rates. These results demonstrate that LAMs, when augmented with protocol-aware reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, laying the foundation for the future Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native Radio Access Network (RAN).</description>

      <title>UAV-enabled Computing Power Networks: Task Completion Probability Analysis</title>

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework that synergistically enhances computing performance through ubiquitous computing power distribution and dynamic computing node accessibility control via adaptive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning, establishing UAV-enabled Computing Power Networks (UAV-CPNs). In UAV-CPNs, UAVs function as dynamic aerial relays, outsourcing tasks generated in the request zone to an expanded service zone, consisting of a diverse range of computing devices, from vehicles with onboard computational capabilities and edge servers to dedicated computing nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks in traditional computing power networks and overcome the "island effect" observed in multi-access edge computing. However, how to quantify the network performance under the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of both communication and computing power is a significant challenge, which introduces intricacies beyond those found in conventional networks. To address this, in this paper, we introduce task completion probability as the primary performance metric for evaluating the ability of UAV-CPNs to complete ground users' tasks within specified end-to-end latency requirements. Utilizing theories from stochastic processes and stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions that facilitate the assessment of this metric. Our numerical results emphasize that striking a delicate balance between communication and computational capabilities is essential for enhancing the performance of UAV-CPNs. Moreover, our findings show significant performance gains from the widespread distribution of computing nodes.</description>

This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks and overcome the "island effect" observed in multi-access edge computing. A significant challenge is to quantify computing power performance under complex dynamics of communication and computing. To address this challenge, we introduce task completion probability to capture the capability of UAV-CPNs for task computing. We further enhance UAV-CPN performance under a hybrid energy architecture by jointly optimizing UAV altitude and transmit power, where fuel cells and batteries collectively power both UAV propulsion and communication systems. Extensive evaluations show significant performance gains, highlighting the importance of balancing communication and computing capabilities, especially under dual-energy constraints. These findings underscore the potential of UAV-CPNs to significantly boost computing power.</description>
