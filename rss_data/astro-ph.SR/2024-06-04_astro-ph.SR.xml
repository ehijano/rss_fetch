      <title>Updated Absolute Parameters and Kinematics of IS CMa</title>

Abstract: Eclipsing binary systems are significant objects for astrophysics in that direct observations can determine the fundamental parameters of stars. In this study, we determined precisely the fundamental parameters of the binary component stars obtained by simultaneous analysis of radial velocities and the {\it TESS} light curve using the Wilson and Devinney code. Following the analysis, the masses and radii of the primary and secondary components were determined as $M_{1}= 1.58\pm 0.01M_\odot$, $M_{2}= 0.48\pm0.02M_\odot$, and $R_{1}=1.93\pm 0.01R_\odot$, $R_{2}= 1.14\pm 0.01 R_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, the distance of IS CMa is calculated as $92.7\pm6.5$ pc. On the basis of the analysis of the mid-eclipse times, it was found that the variation in the orbital period is represented by an upward parabola. It has an increasing rate of $dP/dt$ = 1.09 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ day yr$^{-1}$. Using PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones with solar metallicity were estimated the age of IS CMa as $1.3\pm0.1$ Gyr. Kinematic and Galactic orbital parameters of IS CMa were obtained from the astrometric and spectroscopic data of the system. The Galactic orbit analysis reveals that IS CMa formed inside the solar circle and it is a member of the young thin-disc population.</description>

      <title>Energetic Electrons Accelerated and Trapped in a Magnetic Bottle above a Solar Flare Arcade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a "magnetic bottle" structure, which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles. However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present the first study combining multi-wavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry. The presence of an above-the-looptop magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength but also abruptly slowing down plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides above the flare arcade. Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that are well-matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated electrons entering interplanetary space.</description>

      <title>Stellar Characterization and Chemical Abundances of Exoplanet Hosting M dwarfs from APOGEE Spectra: Future JWST Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets hosting M dwarfs are the best targets to characterize Earth-like or super-Earth planetary atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We determine detailed stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, log$g$, and $\xi$) and individual abundances of twelve elements for four cool M dwarfs hosting exoplanets TOI-1685, GJ 436, GJ 3470, and TOI-2445, scheduled for future observations by the JWST. The analysis utilizes high-resolution near-infrared spectra from the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey between 1.51-1.69$\mu$. Based on 1D-LTE plane-parallel models, we find that TOI-2445 is slightly metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.16$\pm$0.09), while TOI-1685, GJ 436 and GJ 3470 are more metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.06$\pm$0.18, 0.10$\pm$0.20 dex, 0.25$\pm$0.15). The derived C/O ratios for TOI-2445, TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are 0.526$\pm$0.027, 0.558$\pm$0.097, 0.561$\pm$0.029, and 0.638$\pm$0.015, respectively. From results for 28 M dwarfs analyzed homogeneously from APOGEE spectra, we find exoplanet-hosting M dwarfs exhibit a C/O abundance ratio approximately 0.01 to 0.05 higher than those with non-detected exoplanets, at limits of a statistically significant offset. A linear regression of [Fe/H] \textit{vs.} C/O distribution reveals a noticeable difference in the angular coefficient between FGK dwarfs (0.27) and M dwarfs (0.13). Assuming our abundance ratios of Ca/Mg, Si/Mg, Al/Mg, and Fe/Mg, we determine a mass of 3.276$^{+0.448}_{-0.419}$$M_{\oplus}$ for TOI-2445 b, having density (6.793$^{+0.005}_{-0.099}$ g.cm$^{-3}$) and core mass fraction (0.329$_{-0.049}^{+0.028}$) very similar to Earth's. We also present an atlas of 113 well-defined spectral lines to analyze M dwarfs in the $H$-band and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties from variations in the atmospheric parameters, signal-to-noise, and pseudo-continuum.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution during the protostellar collapse: influence on the coupling between the neutral gas and the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between the magnetic field and the gas during the collapsing phase of star-forming cores is strongly affected by the dust size distribution, which is expected to evolve. We aim to investigate the influence of key parameters on the evolution of the dust distribution as well as on the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse. We perform collapsing single zone simulations with shark. The code computes the evolution of the dust distribution, accounting for different grain growth and destruction processes. It also computes the magnetic resistivities. We find that the dust distribution significantly evolves during the protostellar collapse, shaping the magnetic resistivities. The peak size of the distribution, the population of small grains and consequently the magnetic resistivities are controlled by both coagulation and fragmentation rates. Under standard assumptions, the small grains coagulate very early as they collide by ambipolar drift, yielding magnetic resistivities orders of magnitude away from the non-evolving dust case. In particular, the ambipolar resistivity \eta_AD is very high prior to nH=10^10 cm^-3, and as a consequence magnetic braking should be ineffective. In this case, large size protoplanetary disks should result, which is inconsistent with recent observations. To alleviate this tension, we identify mechanisms to reduce the ambipolar resistivity during the protostellar collapse. The most promising are namely: electrostatic repulsion and grain-grain erosion. The evolution of the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse and consequently the shape of the magnetic field in the early life of the protoplanetary disk strongly depends on the possibility to repopulate the small grains or to prevent their early coagulation. Therefore, it is crucial to better constrain the collision outcomes and the dust grain elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Progenitor mass and ejecta asymmetry of SN 2023ixf from nebular spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. SN 2023ixf was discovered in Galaxy M101 in May 2023. Its proximity made it an extremely valuable opportunity for the scientific community to study the characteristics of the SN and its progenitor. A point source detected on archival images and hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric light curve has been used to constrain the former star's properties. There is a significant variation in the published results regarding the initial mass of the progenitor. Nebular spectroscopy provides an independent tool to enhance our understanding of the supernova and its progenitor. Aims. We determine the SN progenitor mass by studying the first published nebular spectrum taken 259 days after the explosion. Methods. We analyze the nebular spectrum taken with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope. Typical emission lines are identified, such as [O I], H{\alpha}, [Ca II], among others. Some species' line profiles show broad and narrow components, indicating two ejecta velocities and an asymmetric ejecta. We infer the progenitor mass of SN 2023ixf by comparing with synthetic spectra and by measuring the forbidden oxygen doublet flux. Results. Based on the flux ratio and the direct comparison with spectra models, the progenitor star of SN 2023ixf had a M_{ZAMS} between 12 and 15 M{_\odot}. In comparison with this, we find the use of the [O I] doublet flux to be less constraining of the progenitor mass. Our results agree with those from hydrodynamical modelling of the early light curve and pre-explosion image estimates pointing to a relatively low-mass progenitor.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the high-resolution spectroscopy of AW UMa and Epsilon CrA: Is the Lucy model valid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A re-examination of high-resolution spectral monitoring of the W UMa-type binaries AW UMa and Epsilon CrA casts doubt on the widely utilized Lucy (1968a, 1968b) model of contact binaries. The detection of the very faint profile of the secondary component in AW UMa leads to a new spectroscopic determination of the mass ratio, q(sp) = 0.092 +/- 0.007, which is close to the previous, medium-resolution spectroscopic result of Pribulla &amp; Rucinski (2008), q(sp) = 0.101 +/- 0.006, and remains substantially different from a cluster of generally accepted photometric results by several authors, concentrated around q(ph) = 0.080 +/- 0.005. The two approaches are independent, with the spectroscopic technique being more direct yet more demanding on telescope/spectrograph resources, while the photometric determinations are accessible to smaller telescopes but entirely dependent on the Lucy model. A survey of binaries with the best-determined values of the mass ratio shows a common tendency for q(ph) &lt; q(sp). The tendency for systematically smaller values of q(ph) may result from the overfilling of the primary lobe and underfilling of the secondary lobe relative to the Roche model geometry, as predicted by the Stepien (2009) model; the tendency may be variable in time. Despite the observed moderate inter-systemic velocities, the photometric Lucy model may remain useful in providing approximate, though biased, results for the mass ratio. A complicating factor in detailed spectral analysis may be the occurrence of Enhanced Spectral-line Perturbations (ESP) projected over the secondary profiles, appearing in different numbers in the two studied binaries. The ESPs are tentatively identified within the Stepien model as collision fronts or fountains of hot, primary-component gas from the circumbinary, energy-carrying flow.</description>

      <title>Quiescent Solar Wind Regions in the Near-Sun Environment: Properties and Radial Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regions of magnetic field with near-radial, Parker Spiral-like geometry known as quiescent regions have been observed in Parker Solar Probe data. These regions have very low $\delta B / \langle |B| \rangle$ compared to non-quiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. Quiescent regions are observed to have lower solar wind bulk speeds, lower proton temperatures, and lower proton density, consistent with properties of the slow solar wind. Inside of 15 Rs, identified quiescent regions show distinct thermal properties, having higher proton temperature anisotropies and lower parallel plasma betas compared to switchback patches observed at the same heliocentric distances. When placed on $\mathcal{R}$ vs $\beta_{\parallel p}$ plots (where $\mathcal{R}$ is the proton temperature anisotropy), quiescent region solar wind is shown to be more stable to proton cyclotron and firehose instabilities than non-quiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. It is shown that quiescent regions evolve similarly to the surrounding non-quiescent solar wind, but quiescent solar wind begins at a different location in the $\mathcal{R}$ vs $\beta_{\parallel p}$ parameter space, suggesting that these regions have separate origins than the more turbulent non-quiescent solar wind. Namely, enhanced temperature anisotropies and enhanced magnetic field strength may be consistent with magnetic field lines which have undergone less magnetic field expansion compared to non-quiescent wind at the same heliocentric distances.</description>

      <title>Inter-planetary type-IV solar radio bursts: A comprehensive catalog and statistical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Model Independent Radius Determination of Single FGK and M Dwarfs Using Gaia DR3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring fundamental stellar parameters is key to fully comprehending the evolution of stars. However, current theoretical models over-predict effective temperatures, and under-predict radii, compared to observations of K and M dwarfs (radius inflation problem). In this work, we developed a model independent method to infer precise radii of single FGK and M dwarfs using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, and we used it to study the radius inflation problem. We calibrated nine surface brightness-color relations for the three Gaia magnitudes and colors using a sample of stars with angular diameter measurements. We achieved an accuracy of 4% in our angular diameter estimations, which Gaia's parallaxes allow us to convert to a physical radii. We validated our method by comparing our radius measurements with literature samples and the Gaia DR3 catalog, which confirmed the accuracy of our method and revealed systematic offsets in the Gaia measurements. Moreover, we used a sample with measured Halpha equivalent width (HaEW), a magnetic activity indicator, to study the radius inflation problem. We demonstrated that active stars have larger radii than inactive stars, showing that radius inflation is correlated with magnetic activity. We found a correlation between the radius inflation of active stars and HaEW for the mass bin 0.5&lt;M[Msun]&lt;= 0.6, but we found no correlation for lower masses. This could be due to lack of precision in our radius estimation or a physical reason. Radius measurements with smaller uncertainties are necessary to distinguish between the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>The temporal evolution of non-neutralized electric currents and the complexity of solar active regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of electric currents during the emergence of magnetic flux in the solar photosphere and the differences exhibited between solar active regions of different Hale complexity classes. A sample of 59 active regions was analyzed using a method based on image segmentation and error analysis to determine the total amount of non-neutralized electric current along their magnetic polarity inversion lines. The time series of the total unsigned non-neutralized electric current, $I_{NN,tot}$, exhibit intricate structure in the form of distinct peaks and valleys. This information is largely missing in the respective time series of the total unsigned vertical electric current $I_z$. Active regions with $\delta$- spots stand out, exhibiting 1.9 times higher flux emergence rate and 2.6 times higher $I_{NN,tot}$ increase. The median value of their peak $I_{NN,tot}$ is equal to $3.6\cdot10^12$ A, which is more than three times higher than that of the other regions of the sample. An automated detection algorithm was also developed to pinpoint the injection events of non-neutralized electric current. The injection rates and duration of these events were higher with increasing complexity of active regions, with regions containing $\delta$-spots exhibiting the strongest and longest events. These events do not necessarily coincide with increasing magnetic flux, although they exhibit moderate correlation. We conclude that net electric currents are injected during flux emergence, but are also shaped drastically by the incurred photospheric evolution, as active regions grow and evolve.</description>

      <title>Filament eruption by multiple reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament eruption is a common phenomenon in solar activity, but the triggering mechanism is not well understood. We focus our study on a filament eruption located in a complex nest of three active regions close to a coronal hole. The filament eruption is observed at multiple wavelengths: by the GONG, the STEREO, the SUTRI, and the AIA and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the SDO. Thanks to high temporal-resolution observations, we were able to analyze the evolution of the fine structure of the filament in detail. The filament changes direction during the eruption, which is followed by a halo coronal mass ejection detected by the LASCO on board the SOHO. A Type III radio burst was also registered at the time of the eruption. To investigate the process of the eruption, we analyzed the magnetic topology of the filament region adopting a nonlinear force-free-field (NLFFF) extrapolation method and the polytropic global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling. We modeled the filament by embeddingatwisted fluxropewiththe regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) method in the ambient magnetic f ield. The extrapolation results show that magnetic reconnection occurs in a fan-spine configuration resulting in a circular flare ribbon. The global modeling of the corona demonstrates that there was an interaction between the filament and open field lines, causing a deflection of the filament in the direction of the observed CME eruption and dimming area. The modeling supports the following scenario: magnetic reconnection not only occurs with the filament itself (the flux rope) but also with the background magnetic field lines and open field lines of the coronal hole located to the east of the flux rope. This multiwavelength analysis indicates that the filament undergoes multiple magnetic reconnections on small and large scales with a drifting of the flux rope.</description>

      <title>A model of umbral oscillations inherited from subphotospheric fast-body modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, complex horizontal patterns of umbral oscillations have been reported, but their physical nature and origin are still not fully understood. Here we show that the two-dimensional patterns of umbral oscillations of slow waves are inherited from the subphotospheric fast-body modes. Using a simple analytic model, we successfully reproduced the temporal evolution of oscillation patterns with a finite number of fast-body modes. In this model, the radial apparent propagation of the pattern is associated with the appropriate combination of the amplitudes in radial modes. We also find that the oscillation patterns are dependent on the oscillation period. This result indicates that there is a cutoff radial mode, which is a unique characteristic of the model of fast-body modes. In principle, both internal and external sources can excite these fast-body modes and produce horizontal patterns of umbral oscillations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Axion-Photon Coupling Using Stellar Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has been shown to be, together with stellar modelling, an invaluable tool in constraining properties of novel physics. In this work, we study for the first time the influence of axionic production in the evolution of a late main-sequence star, comparing computational models with observational data in order to constrain the axion-photon $g_{a\gamma}$ coupling parameter. We first perform a high-precision calibration of a stellar model to our target star, in order to obtain a benchmark for our other diagnostics. We then apply a two-stage test, first using global quantities and then resorting to precision seismic ratios. We find that seismology allows us to place an independent upper bound of $g_{a\gamma} \leq 0.98\times 10^{-10} $ GeV$^{-1}$ at a $68\%$ confidence level (CL), in the same order of magnitude as both the most recent constraints from the observation of globular clusters and previous bounds obtained through stellar modelling, but more stringent than most current direct axion detections. We also suggest a more conservative limit of $g_{a\gamma} \leq 1.38\times 10^{-10} $ GeV$^{-1}$ at a $95\%$ CL. Moreover, this new diagnostic method can be applied to stellar data that will be obtained in future asteroseismic projects.</description>

      <title>An absence of binary companions to Wolf-Rayet stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud: implications for mass loss and black hole masses at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to predict the black hole mass distributions at high redshift, we need to understand whether very massive single stars ($M&gt;40$ M$_\odot$) at low metallicity $Z$ lose their hydrogen-rich envelopes, like their metal-rich counterparts, or whether a binary companion is required to achieve this. To test this, we undertake a deep spectroscopic search for binary companions of the seven apparently single Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; $Z \simeq 1/5 Z_\odot$). For each of them, we acquired six high-quality VLT-UVES spectra spread over 1.5 years. By using the narrow N V lines in these spectra, we monitor radial velocity (RV) variations to search for binary motion. We find low RV variations between 6 and 23 km/s for the seven WR stars, with a median standard deviation of $5$ km/s. Our Monte Carlo simulations imply probabilities below ~5% for any of our target WR stars to have a binary companion more massive than ~5 M$_\odot$ at orbital periods of less than a year. We estimate that the probability that all our target WR stars have companions with orbital periods shorter than 10 yr is below ~10$^{-5}$, and argue that the observed modest RV variations may originate from intrinsic atmosphere or wind variability. Our findings imply that metal-poor massive stars born with $M \gtrsim 40$ M$_\odot$ can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes via stellar winds or eruptive mass loss, which strongly constrains their initial mass - black hole mass relation. We also identify two of our seven target stars (SMC AB1 and SMC AB11) as runaway stars with a peculiar radial velocity of ~80 km/s. Moreover, with all five previously detected WR binaries in the SMC exhibiting orbital periods of below 20 d, a puzzling absence of intermediate-to-long-period WR binaries has emerged, with strong implications for the outcome of massive binary interaction at low metallicity.</description>

      <title>Observational tests in scale invariance III: wide binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of wide binary stars based on Gaia DR3 suggest that the relative orbital velocities of objects with separations s &gt; 3'000 astronomical units are statistically larger than the standard Newtonian predictions. Obviously there is no Dark Matter halo arround binary stars that could be invoked to explain these high velocities. However, we explore the properties of two-body systems in the framework of scale invariant vacuum theory, focusing on the case of objects with extreme separations. In this regime, the additional acceleration term present in the modified Newton equation with scale invariance becomes important, and may even dominate the dynamical evolution at very low gravities. Comparisons with Gaia DR3 observations of wide binaries are performed and suggest that binaries with separations s &gt; 3'000 astronomical units have experienced such an evolution for a few Gyr, accounting well for the observed velocity excesses.</description>

      <title>Observations and detectability of young Suns' flaring and CME activity in optical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's history is still a subject of interest to modern astrophysics. Observationally constrained CME rates of young solar analogues are still lacking, as those require dedicated monitoring. We present medium resolution optical spectroscopic monitoring of a small sample of bright and prominent solar analogues over a period of three years using the 0.5m telescope at observatory Lustb\"uhel Graz (OLG) of the University of Graz, Austria. The aim is the detection of flares and CMEs from those spectra. In more than 1700 hours of spectroscopic monitoring we found signatures of four flares and one filament eruption on EK Dra which has been reported in previous literature, but we complementarily extended the data to cover the latter phase. The other stars did not reveal detectable signatures of activity. For these non-detections we derive upper limits of occurrence rates of very massive CMEs, which are detectable with our observational setup, ranging from 0.1 to 2.2 per day , but these may be even smaller than the given rates considering observational biases. Furthermore, we investigate the detectability of flares/CMEs in OLG spectra by utilizing solar 2D H{\alpha} spectra from MEES solar observatory. We find that solar-sized events are not detectable within our observations. By scaling up the size of the solar event, we show that with a fractional active region area of 18% in residual spectra and 72% in equivalent width time series derived from the same residuals that solar events are detectable if they had hypothetically occurred on HN Peg.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Photometric Light Curve Analysis: Evaluating Scipy's Minimize Function for Eclipse Mapping of Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a particular focus on Scipy's minimize function the eclipse mapping method is thoroughly researched and implemented utilizing Python and essential libraries. Many optimization techniques are used, including Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP), Nelder-Mead, and Conjugate Gradient (CG). However, for the purpose of examining photometric light curves these methods seek to solve the maximum entropy equation under a chi-squared constraint. Therefore, these techniques are first evaluated on two-dimensional Gaussian data without a chi-squared restriction, and then they are used to map the accretion disc and uncover the Gaussian structure of the Cataclysmic Variable KIC 201325107. Critical analysis is performed on the code structure to find possible faults and design problems. Additionally, the analysis shows how several factors impacting computing time and image quality are included including the variance in Gaussian weighting, disc image resolution, number of data points in the light curve, and degree of constraint.</description>

      <title>Local Hamiltonian dynamics from non-local action principles and applications to binary systems in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of finite-dimensional dynamical systems whose equations of motion are derived from a non-local-in-time action principle. The action functional has a zeroth order piece derived from a local Hamiltonian and a perturbation in the form of a non-local functional of the trajectory on phase space. We prove that the dynamics of these systems admits a local Hamiltonian description to all order in the perturbation and we provide explicit formulae for the $\mathcal{N}^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian and symplectic form in terms of the $(\mathcal{N}-1)^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian flow. In the context of general relativity, these systems arise in the study of binary systems such as pairs of black holes or neutron stars in the small mass-ratio and post-Newtonian approximations. We provide applications of the formalism to binary systems in these regimes.</description>

      <title>Ionizing photons produced by massive stars in SMC-N88a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The H II region N88a in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a spherical region of $1.5~\mathrm{pc}$ diameter, with high concentration of gas and dust, and at least four massive stars within it. Previous studies suggest that the four known sources may be insufficient to ionize the region and explain the nebular emission. In this contribution we analyze the ionizing photon production of the four known sources within the H II region. We compared the available photometry in the literature with the spectral energy distribution calculated for the ``Potsdam Wolf-Rayet'' (PoWR) models of massive stars for a wide range of dust extinction coefficient (Av). In particular, we selected models of OB-type atmospheres with SMC metallicity and compared the ionizing photon flux prediction with previous estimates based on the nebular emission of the H {\sc ii} region. We found that the Av values that best reproduce the photometry of each source vary from 0.82 to 3.84, increasing toward the dust band that runs through the nebula. In addition, all four sources are compatible with O-type stars with $\mathrm{T_{eff}} &gt; 40 ~\mathrm{kK}$ and intrinsic ratios $\mathrm{F(LyC)/F(UV)}&gt;1$. Lastly, the total ionizing photon rate predicted by the hottest models is $\mathrm{log(Q_H)} &gt; 49.6 ~\mathrm{ph\ s}^{-1}$, which suggests that the stars could maintain the ionization state of the nebula.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau (Coulomb, Fokker-Planck) collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator completely. Additionally, by considering the cases of self-collisions and $m_a\ll m_b$, we express all of the Braginskii transport coefficients through the Chapman-Cowling integrals as well. We thus offer a multi-fluid 22-moment model as well as the Braginskii model, which are valid for a large class of (elastic) collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. The particular collisional process - the hard spheres, the Coulomb collisions, the Maxwell molecules, the inverse interparticle force $\sim 1/r^\nu$ (or other cases not discussed here), are specified only at the end, by simply selecting few (pure) numbers. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>The Complex Star Formation History of the Halo of NGC 5128 (Cen A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 5128 (Cen A) is the nearest giant elliptical galaxy and one of the brightest extragalactic radio sources in the sky, boasting a prominent dust lane and jets emanating from its nuclear supermassive black hole. In this paper, we construct the star formation history (SFH) of two small fields in the halo of NGC 5128: a northeastern field (Field 1) at a projected distance of $\sim 18.8$ kpc from the center, and a southern field (Field 2) $\sim 9.9$ kpc from the center. Our method is based on identifying long period variable (LPV) stars that trace their sibling stellar population and hence historical star formation due to their high luminosity and strong variability; we identified 395 LPVs in Field 1 and 671 LPVs in Field 2. Even though the two fields are $\sim 28$ kpc apart on opposite sides from the center, they show similar SFHs. In Field 1, star formation rates (SFRs) increased significantly around $t\sim 800$ Myr and $t\sim 3.8$ Gyr; and in Field 2, SFRs increased considerably around $t\sim 800$ Myr, $t\sim 3.8$ Gyr, and $t\sim 6.3$ Gyr, where $t$ is look--back time. The increase in SFR $\sim 800$ Myr ago agrees with previous suggestions that the galaxy experienced a merger around that time. The SFH reconstructed from LPVs supports a scenario in which multiple episodes of nuclear activity lead to episodic jet-induced star formation. While there is no catalog of LPVs for the central part of NGC 5128, applying our method to the outer regions (for the first time in a galaxy outside the Local Group) has enabled us to put constraints on the complex evolution of this cornerstone galaxy.</description>

      <title>Role of particle diffusion in shaping the gravitational wave signal from neutron star inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that the dissipative properties of superdense matter play a negligible role in modeling gravitational waveforms from neutron star inspirals. This study aims to investigate whether this presumption holds true for the often neglected dissipative process associated with particle diffusion in superconducting neutron stars. As we demonstrate, diffusion effects can significantly impact the phase of the gravitational wave from the inspiral, manifesting at a magnitude of a few tens of milliradians at large orbit separations, equivalent to orbital frequencies of a few hertz. We also find that dissipation resulting from particle diffusion might increase the neutron star's temperature to approximately $10^7\rm K$ during the inspiral.</description>

      <title>Ohm's Law, the Reconnection Rate, and Energy Conversion in Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous plasma process that transforms magnetic energy into particle energy during eruptive events throughout the universe. Reconnection not only converts energy during solar flares and geomagnetic substorms that drive space weather near Earth, but it may also play critical roles in the high energy emissions from the magnetospheres of neutron stars and black holes. In this review article, we focus on collisionless plasmas that are most relevant to reconnection in many space and astrophysical plasmas. Guided by first-principles kinetic simulations and spaceborne in-situ observations, we highlight the most recent progress in understanding this fundamental plasma process. We start by discussing the non-ideal electric field in the generalized Ohm's law that breaks the frozen-in flux condition in ideal magnetohydrodynamics and allows magnetic reconnection to occur. We point out that this same reconnection electric field also plays an important role in sustaining the current and pressure in the current sheet and then discuss the determination of its magnitude (i.e., the reconnection rate), based on force balance and energy conservation. This approach to determining the reconnection rate is applied to kinetic current sheets of a wide variety of magnetic geometries, parameters, and background conditions. We also briefly review the key diagnostics and modeling of energy conversion around the reconnection diffusion region, seeking insights from recently developed theories. Finally, future prospects and open questions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A high-velocity star recently ejected by an intermediate-mass black hole in M15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, yet their existence remains elusive, except for the LIGO-Virgo detection. We report the discovery of a high-velocity star J0731+3717, whose backward trajectory about 21 Myr ago intersects that of globular cluster M15 within the cluster tidal radius. Both its metallicity [Fe/H] and its alpha-to-iron abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are consistent with those of M15. Furthermore, its location falls right on the fiducial sequence of the cluster M15 on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, suggesting similar ages. These support that J0731+3717 is originally associated with M15 at a confidence level of $5.4\sigma$. We find that such a high-velocity star ($V_{\rm ej} = 548^{+6}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$) was most likely tidally ejected from as close as one astronomical unit to the center of M15, confirming an IMBH ($\ge 100 M_{\odot}$ with a credibility of 98%) as the exclusive nature of the central unseen mass proposed previously.</description>

      <title>Progenitor and explosion properties of SN 2023ixf estimated based on a light-curve model grid of Type II supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the progenitor and explosion properties of the nearby Type II SN 2023ixf using a synthetic model grid of Type II supernova light curves. By comparing the light curves of SN 2023ixf with the pre-existing grid of Type II supernovae containing about 228,000 models with different combinations of the progenitor and explosion properties, we obtain the chi2 value for every model and evaluate the properties of the models providing small values of chi2. We found that the light-curve models with the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of 10 Msun, the explosion energy of (2-3)e51 erg, the 56Ni mass of 0.04-0.06 Msun, the mass-loss rate of 1e-3 - 1e-2 Msun/yr with a wind velocity of 10 km/s, and the dense, confined circumstellar matter radius of (6-10)e14 cm match well to the observed light curves of SN 2023ixf. The photospheric velocity evolution of these models is also consistent with the observed velocity evolution. Although our parameter estimation is based on a pre-existing model grid and we do not perform any additional computations, the estimated parameters are consistent with those obtained by the detailed modeling of SN 2023ixf previously reported. This result shows that comparing the pre-existing model grid is a reasonable way to obtain a rough estimate for the properties of Type II supernovae. This simple way to estimate the properties of Type II supernovae will be essential in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) era when thousands of Type II supernovae are expected to be discovered yearly.</description>

Abstract: In several processes of stellar nucleosynthesis, like the astrophysical gamma-process, nuclear reactions involving alpha particles play an important role. The description of these reactions necessitates the knowledge of the alpha-nucleus optical model potential (AOMP) which is highly ambiguous at low, astrophysical energies. This ambiguity introduces a substantial uncertainty in the stellar models for predicting elemental and isotopic abundances. The experimental study of the AOMP is thus necessary which can be implemented by measuring the cross section of alpha-induced nuclear reactions. At low energies, (a,n) reactions are suitable for such a purpose. Therefore, in the present work, the (a,n) cross sections of four Te isotopes have been measured, mostly for the first time, and compared with theoretical predictions. The (a,n) cross sections of 120,122,124,130Te have been measured in the energy range between about 10 and 17 MeV using the activation method. The detection of the gamma radiation following the decay of the radioactive reaction products were used to determine the cross sections. The measured cross sections are compared with statistical model calculations obtained from the widely used TALYS nuclear reaction simulation code. Predictions using various available AOMPs are investigated. It is found that the recently developed Atomki-V2 AOMP provides the best description for all studied reactions and this potential also reproduces well the total reaction cross sections from elastic scattering experiments, when they are available in literature. We recommend therefore to use the astrophysical reaction rates based on this potential for nucleosynthesis models of heavy elements.</description>

Abstract: The TEMPO (Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and Planets in Orion) Survey is a proposed 30-day observational campaign using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By providing deep, high-resolution, short-cadence infrared photometry of a dynamic star-forming region, TEMPO will investigate the demographics of exosatellites orbiting free-floating planets and brown dwarfs -- a largely unexplored discovery space. Here, we present the simulated detection yields of three populations: extrasolar moon analogs orbiting free-floating planets, exosatellites orbiting brown dwarfs, and exoplanets orbiting young stars. Additionally, we outline a comprehensive range of anticipated scientific outcomes accompanying such a survey. These science drivers include: obtaining observational constraints to test prevailing theories of moon, planet, and star formation; directly detecting widely separated exoplanets orbiting young stars; investigating the variability of young stars and brown dwarfs; constraining the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function; constructing the distribution of dust in the Orion Nebula and mapping evolution in the near-infrared extinction law; mapping emission features that trace the shocked gas in the region; constructing a dynamical map of Orion members using proper motions; and searching for extragalactic sources and transients via deep extragalactic observations reaching a limiting magnitude of $m_{AB}=29.7$\,mag (F146 filter).</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- II. Discovery of Brown Dwarfs in NGC 6397 and Measurement of Age from the Brown Dwarf Cooling Sequence, using SANDee - a New Grid of Model Isochrones across the Hydrogen-Burning Limit</title>

Abstract: Globular clusters contain vast repositories of metal-poor stars that represent some of the oldest stellar generations in the Universe. The archaeological footprint of early Galactic evolution may be retained in the measurable properties of globular clusters, such as their ages, mass functions and chemical abundances. Until recently, all photometric studies of globular clusters were restricted to stellar members. Now, the sensitivity of JWST can extend this analysis to the substellar regime. If detected in sufficient numbers, brown dwarf members can provide tight constraints on the properties of their parent population. We present SANDee - a new grid of stellar models that accurately represent the color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters across the hydrogen-burning limit at a wide range of metallicities. Using JWST NIRCam photometry and the new models, we identify three brown dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397 with effective temperatures of 1300-1800 K, confirmed by both proper motion and model fitting. We use the observed luminosities of discovered brown dwarfs to obtain the first age estimate of a globular cluster from its substellar cooling sequence: 13.4 +/- 3.3 Gyr. We also derive the local mass function of the cluster across the hydrogen-burning limit and find it to be top-heavy, suggesting extensive dynamical evolution. We expect that the constraints on both age and mass function of NGC 6397 derived in this work can be greatly improved by a second epoch of NIRCam imaging in the same field.</description>

      <title>The colliding-wind binary HD 168112</title>

Abstract: Radio surveys of early-type stars have revealed a number of non-thermal emitters. Most of these have been shown to be binaries, where the collision between the two stellar winds is responsible for the non-thermal emission. HD 168112 is a non-thermal radio emitter, whose binary nature has only recently been confirmed spectroscopically. We obtained independent spectroscopic observations to determine its orbit, in addition to radio observations to see if the thermal or non-thermal nature of the emission changes during the periastron passage. We monitored HD 168112 spectroscopically for a 13 year time span. From these data, we determined the orbital parameters, which we compared to the previous results in the literature. From the spectral index of the radio observations, we found how the nature of the emission changes as the system goes through periastron. Combining our results with other literature data allowed us to further constrain the orbital and stellar parameters. We find HD 168112 to have an orbital period of P = 512.17+0.41-0.11 d, an eccentricity of e = 0.7533+0.0053-0.0124, and a mass ratio close to one. From our spectroscopic modelling, we derived the stellar parameters, but we had difficulty arriving at a spectroscopic mass ratio of one. The radio observations around periastron show only thermal emission, suggesting that most of the synchrotron photons are absorbed in the two stellar winds at that phase. Combining our data with the optical interferometry detection, we could constrain the inclination angle to i ~ 63 deg, and the mass of each component to ~ 26 Msun. We have provided an independent spectroscopic confirmation of the binary nature of HD 168112. Although detected as a non-thermal radio emitter, near periastron the radio emission of this highly eccentric system is thermal and is mainly formed in the colliding-wind region.

      <title>Impact of the $^6$Li asymptotic normalization constant onto $\alpha$-induced reactions of astrophysical interest</title>

Abstract: Indirect methods have become the predominant approach in experimental nuclear astrophysics for studying several low-energy nuclear reactions occurring in stars, as direct measurements of many of these relevant reactions are rendered infeasible due to their low reaction probability. Such indirect methods, however, require theoretical input that in turn can have significant poorly-quantified uncertainties, which can then be propagated to the reaction rates and have a large effect on our quantitative understanding of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis processes. We present two such examples involving $\alpha$-induced reactions, $^{13}$C($\alpha,n)^{16}$O and $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O, for which the low-energy cross sections have been constrained with $(^6$Li$,d)$ transfer data. In this Letter, we discuss how a first-principle calculation of $^6$Li leads to a 21% reduction of the $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O cross sections with respect to a previous estimation. This calculation further resolves the discrepancy between recent measurements of the $^{13}$C$(\alpha,n)^{16}$O reaction and points to the need for improved theoretical formulations of nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. I. HST WFC3/IR F110W and F160W Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distance method in the I band is one of the most efficient and precise techniques for measuring distances to nearby galaxies (D &lt;= 15 Mpc). The TRGB in the near infrared (NIR) is 1 to 2 magnitudes brighter relative to the I band, and has the potential to expand the range over which distance measurements to nearby galaxies are feasible. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 12 fields in 8 nearby galaxies, we determine color-based corrections and zero points of the TRGB in the Wide Field Camera 3 IR (WFC3/IR) F110W and F160W filters. First, we measure TRGB distances in the I band equivalent Advanced Camera System (ACS) F814W filter from resolved stellar populations with the HST. The TRGB in the ACS F814W filter is used for our distance anchor and to place the WFC3/IR magnitudes on an absolute scale. We then determine the color dependence (a proxy for metallicity/age) and zero point of the NIR TRGB from photometry of WFC3/IR fields which overlap with the ACS fields. The new calibration is accurate to ~1% in distance, relative to the F814W TRGB. Validating the accuracy of the calibrations, we find that the distance modulus for each field using the NIR TRGB calibration agrees with the distance modulus of the same fields as determined from the F814W TRGB. This is a JWST preparatory program and the work done here will directly inform our approach to calibrating the TRGB in JWST NIRCam and NIRISS photometric filters.</description>

      <title>TOI-1173 A $b$: The First Inflated Super-Neptune in a Wide Binary System</title>

Abstract: Among Neptunian mass exoplanets ($20-50$ M$_\oplus$), puffy hot Neptunes are extremely rare, and their unique combination of low mass and extended radii implies very low density ($\rho &lt; 0.3$~g~cm$^{-3}$). Over the last decade, only a few puffy planets have been detected and precisely characterized with both transit and radial velocity observations, most notably including WASP-107~$b$, TOI-1420~$b$, and WASP-193 $b$. In this paper, we report the discovery of TOI-1173 A $b$, a low-density ($\rho = 0.195_{-0.017}^{+0.018}$~g~cm$^{-3}$) super-Neptune with $P = 7.06$ days in a nearly circular orbit around the primary G-dwarf star in the wide binary system TOI-1173 A/B. Using radial velocity observations with the MAROON-X and HIRES spectrographs and transit photometry from TESS, we determined a planet mass of $M_{\rm{p}} = 27.4\pm1.7\ M_{\oplus}$ and radius of $R_{\rm{p}} = 9.19\pm0.18\ R_{\oplus}$. TOI-1173 A $b$ is the first puffy Super-Neptune planet detected in a wide binary system (projected separation $\sim 11,400$~AU). We explored several mechanisms to understand the puffy nature of TOI-1173 A $b$, and showed that tidal heating is the most promising explanation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TOI-1173 A $b$ likely has maintained its orbital stability over time and may have undergone von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration followed by tidal circularization given its present-day architecture, with important implications for planet migration theory and induced engulfment into the host star. Further investigation of the atmosphere of TOI-1173 A $b$ will shed light on the origin of close-in low-density Neptunian planets in field and binary systems, while spin-orbit analyses may elucidate the dynamical evolution of the system.</description>
