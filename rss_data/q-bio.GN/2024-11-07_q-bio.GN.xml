      <title>Exploring the Potentials and Challenges of Using Large Language Models for the Analysis of Transcriptional Regulation of Long Non-coding RNAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has garnered significant attention due to their critical roles in gene regulation and disease mechanisms. However, the complexity and diversity of lncRNA sequences, along with the limited knowledge of their functional mechanisms and the regulation of their expressions, pose significant challenges to lncRNA studies. Given the tremendous success of large language models (LLMs) in capturing complex dependencies in sequential data, this study aims to systematically explore the potential and limitations of LLMs in the sequence analysis related to the transcriptional regulation of lncRNA genes. Our extensive experiments demonstrated promising performance of fine-tuned genome foundation models on progressively complex tasks. Furthermore, we conducted an insightful analysis of the critical impact of task complexity, model selection, data quality, and biological interpretability for the studies of the regulation of lncRNA gene expression.</description>

      <title>BWT construction and search at the terabase scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a common component in full-text indices. Initially developed for data compression, it is particularly powerful for encoding redundant sequences such as pangenome data. However, BWT construction is resource intensive and hard to be parallelized, and many methods for querying large full-text indices only report exact matches or their simple extensions. These limitations have hampered the biological applications of full-text indices.
  Results: We developed ropebwt3 for efficient BWT construction and query. Ropebwt3 indexed 320 assembled human genomes in 65 hours and indexed 7.3 terabases of commonly studied bacterial assemblies in 26 days. This was achieved using up to 170 gigabytes of memory at the peak without working disk space. Ropebwt3 can find maximal exact matches and inexact alignments under affine-gap penalties, and can retrieve similar local haplotypes matching a query sequence. It demonstrates the feasibility of full-text indexing at the terabase scale.
