      <title>High-Performance Gradient Evaluation for Complex Soft Materials Using MPI-based DFS Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a depth-first search (DFS)-based algorithm for evaluating sensitivity gradients in the topology optimization of soft materials exhibiting complex deformation behavior. The algorithm is formulated using a time-dependent adjoint sensitivity approach and is implemented within a PETSc-based C++ MPI framework for efficient parallel computing. It has been found that on a single processor, the sensitivity analysis for these complex materials can take approximately 45 minutes. This necessitates the use of high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve feasible optimization times. This work provides insights into the algorithmic framework and its application to large-scale generative design for physics integrated simulation of soft materials under complex loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Proposed 2MW Wind Turbine for Use in the Governorate of Dhofar at the Sultanate of Oman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a preliminary design of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) as a candidate for the Dhofar Wind Farm project, in the southern Omani Governorate "Dhofar", at the southwest part of the Sultanate of Oman. This wind farm (under construction) is considered to be the first commercial, utility-scale (50MW) wind farm in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) area. The proposed wind turbine has an expected electricity generation of 2MW. We studied the wind atlas of Oman and from which we determined the maximum possible mean wind speed in the entire Sultanate and built our design based on that reference value, which is 6m/s (21.6km/h). After this, we applied a set of modeling equations that estimate the power output from the wind turbine rotor and matched the target electric power to the design variables using a MATLAB computer code. We reached a suitable design and we present here the distribution of the blade angle (twist angle), and the power per unit span along the rotor blade. The rotor design has 3 blades with a diameter of 70m and a rotational speed of 24rpm. This rotor gives 2.37MW of output power, which exceeds the target 2MW output, allowing for about 15% of power losses in the gearbox and generator. We utilized some commercial designs of wind turbines from different international manufacturers as references for typical limits or recommended values of some design parameters.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary approach to predict slope displacement of earth embankments under earthquake ground motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate slope stability analysis of earth embankments under ground shaking is of great importance for practical use in earthquake geotechnics. This study aims to predict soil slope displacements of earth embankments subjected to earthquake loading using evolutionary algorithms. Comprehensive real case histories of slope displacement of earth embankments under past earthquakes in different areas of the world were gathered and analyzed. A robust model was then developed to predict earthquake induced soil slope displacements using gene expression programming (GEP). Characteristics of earthquake ground motion including earthquake magnitude, earthquake predominant period, maximum earthquake acceleration and also geotechnical specifications of earth embankment including yield acceleration and fundamental period of earth embankment were taken as most influential factors on the slope displacements of earth embankments under earthquakes. Subsequently, performance of developed GEP-based predictive model was assessed using a sensitivity analysis under various effective factors. Finally, the accuracy of the predictive model was evaluated through comparison with the available relationships for estimation of seismic soil slope displacements. The results clearly indicate favorable accuracy of developed GEP-based model to predict slope displacements of earth embankments subjected to earthquake ground motions.</description>

      <title>A Review of HPC-Accelerated CFD in National Security and Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using High-Performance Computing (HPC), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) now serves as an essential component in defense-related national security applications including missile interception and hypersonic propulsion as well as naval stealth optimization and urban hazard dispersion. This review combines two decades of open-source and public-domain research on HPC-accelerated CFD in defense, addressing three key questions: Which security-sensitive simulations have utilized open-source CFD frameworks such as OpenFOAM, SU2 and ADflow? Which HPC techniques, such as MPI domain decomposition and GPU acceleration together with hybrid parallelism best enhance open-source frameworks to manage large defense CFD simulations? Which technological advancements and research voids currently drive the directional development of the field? Examining several research studies sourced from NASA, DoD HPC centers, and academic institutions, scientific contributions have been classified into air, maritime, and space domains. Modular frameworks like NavyFOAM and SU2 and ADflow's adjoint-based solvers show how custom open-source solutions support workflows with rapid completion of multi-million cell simulations. The conclusion highlights new trends that combine exascale readiness with machine learning surrogate models for real-time CFD applications and interdisciplinary HPC-driven multi-physics integration to deliver practical insights for improving CFD use in defense research and development.</description>

      <title>Introducing Repository Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing from engineering systems and control theory, we introduce a framework to understand repository stability, which is a repository activity capacity to return to equilibrium following disturbances - such as a sudden influx of bug reports, key contributor departures, or a spike in feature requests. The framework quantifies stability through four indicators: commit patterns, issue resolution, pull request processing, and community engagement, measuring development consistency, problem-solving efficiency, integration effectiveness, and sustainable participation, respectively. These indicators are synthesized into a Composite Stability Index (CSI) that provides a normalized measure of repository health proxied by its stability. Finally, the framework introduces several important theoretical properties that validate its usefulness as a measure of repository health and stability. At a conceptual phase and open to debate, our work establishes mathematical criteria for evaluating repository stability and proposes new ways to understand sustainable development practices. The framework bridges control theory concepts with modern collaborative software development, providing a foundation for future empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Enhanced Polyconvexification of Isotropic Energy Densities in Computational Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural network approach for fast evaluation of parameter-dependent polyconvex envelopes, which are crucial in computational mechanics. Our method uses a neural network architecture that inherently encodes polyconvexity in the main variable by combining a feature extraction layer that computes the minors function on the signed singular value characterisation of isotropic energy densities with a partially input convex neural network (PICNN). Polyconvex underestimation is weakly enforced by penalisation during training, as are the symmetries of the function. As a guiding example, we focus on a well-known isotropic damage problem, reformulated in terms of signed singular values, and apply a splitting approach to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space, thereby making training more tractable. Numerical experiments show that the networks achieve sufficient accuracy for engineering applications while providing high compression and significant speed-up over traditional polyconvexification schemes. Most importantly, the network adapts to varying physical or material parameters, enabling real-time polyconvexification in large-scale computational mechanics scenarios.</description>

      <title>SolRPDS: A Dataset for Analyzing Rug Pulls in Solana Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rug pulls in Solana have caused significant damage to users interacting with Decentralized Finance (DeFi). A rug pull occurs when developers exploit users' trust and drain liquidity from token pools on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), leaving users with worthless tokens. Although rug pulls in Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have gained attention recently, analysis of rug pulls in Solana remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we introduce SolRPDS (Solana Rug Pull Dataset), the first public rug pull dataset derived from Solana's transactions. We examine approximately four years of DeFi data (2021-2024) that covers suspected and confirmed tokens exhibiting rug pull patterns. The dataset, derived from 3.69 billion transactions, consists of 62,895 suspicious liquidity pools. The data is annotated for inactivity states, which is a key indicator, and includes several detailed liquidity activities such as additions, removals, and last interaction as well as other attributes such as inactivity periods and withdrawn token amounts, to help identify suspicious behavior. Our preliminary analysis reveals clear distinctions between legitimate and fraudulent liquidity pools and we found that 22,195 tokens in the dataset exhibit rug pull patterns during the examined period. SolRPDS can support a wide range of future research on rug pulls including the development of data-driven and heuristic-based solutions for real-time rug pull detection and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Image Embeddings for E-Commerce: Evaluating Off-the Shelf Foundation Models, Fine-Tuning Strategies and Practical Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We benchmark foundation models image embeddings for classification and retrieval in e-Commerce, evaluating their suitability for real-world applications. Our study spans embeddings from pre-trained convolutional and transformer models trained via supervised, self-supervised, and text-image contrastive learning. We assess full fine-tuning and transfer learning (top-tuning) on six diverse e-Commerce datasets: fashion, consumer goods, cars, food, and retail. Results show full fine-tuning consistently performs well, while text-image and self-supervised embeddings can match its performance with less training. While supervised embeddings remain stable across architectures, SSL and contrastive embeddings vary significantly, often benefiting from top-tuning. Top-tuning emerges as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, reducing computational costs. We also explore cross-tuning, noting its impact depends on dataset characteristics. Our findings offer practical guidelines for embedding selection and fine-tuning strategies, balancing efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Dual Engines of Thoughts: A Depth-Breadth Integration Framework for Open-Ended Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for comprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks primarily focus on finding "the best answer" or "the correct answer" for single-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for "open-ended questions," enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The framework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user queries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and validation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore diverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations). This integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with in-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust analytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements. Experimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted questions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning models, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09647v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for sector-level portfolio allocation through systematic analysis of macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment. Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</description>

      <title>LATTE: Lightweight Attention-based Traffic Accident Anticipation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting traffic accidents in real-time is a critical challenge in autonomous driving, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational overhead or fail to adequately address the uncertainty of evolving traffic scenarios. This paper introduces LATTE, a Lightweight Attention-based Traffic Accident Anticipation Engine, which integrates computational efficiency with state-of-the-art performance. LATTE employs Efficient Multiscale Spatial Aggregation (EMSA) to capture spatial features across scales, Memory Attention Aggregation (MAA) to enhance temporal modeling, and Auxiliary Self-Attention Aggregation (AAA) to extract latent dependencies over extended sequences. Additionally, LATTE incorporates the Flamingo Alert-Assisted System (FAA), leveraging a vision-language model to provide real-time, cognitively accessible verbal hazard alerts, improving passenger situational awareness. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate LATTE's superior predictive capabilities and computational efficiency. LATTE achieves state-of-the-art 89.74% Average Precision (AP) on DAD benchmark, with 5.4% higher mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA) than the second-best model, and maintains competitive mTTA at a Recall of 80% (TTA@R80) (4.04s) while demonstrating robust accident anticipation across diverse driving conditions. Its lightweight design delivers a 93.14% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and a 31.58% decrease in parameter count (Params), enabling real-time operation on resource-limited hardware without compromising performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of LATTE's architectural components, while visualizations and failure case analyses highlight its practical applicability and areas for enhancement.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Model Based Approach for Evaluating Task-Competence of Antagonistic Continuum Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robot arms have made significant progress towards completing human-scale tasks, but designing arms for tasks with specific load and workspace requirements remains difficult. A key challenge is the lack of model-based design tools, forcing advancement to occur through empirical iteration and observation. Existing models are focused on control and rely on parameter fits, which means they cannot provide general conclusions about the mapping between design and performance or the influence of factors outside the fitting data.As a first step toward model-based design tools, we introduce a novel method of analyzing whether a proposed arm design can complete desired tasks. Our method is informative, interpretable, and fast; it provides novel metrics for quantifying a proposed arm design's ability to perform a task, it yields a graphical interpretation of performance through segment forces, and computing it is over 80x faster than optimization based methods.Our formulation focuses on antagonistic, pneumatically-driven soft arms. We demonstrate our approach through example analysis, and also through consideration of antagonistic vs non-antagonistic designs. Our method enables fast, direct and task-specific comparison of these two architectures, and provides a new visualization of the comparative mechanics. While only a first step, the proposed approach will support advancement of model-based design tools, leading to highly capable soft arms.</description>
