      <title>Cramer's moderate deviations of modularity in network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks play a crucial role in understanding physical, biological, social and technological systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure. In this paper, for a specific partition of a given network, we prove the Cramer's moderate deviations of modularity for the partition when the size of the network gets large.</description>

      <title>On the Li--Zheng theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the well-known I.Kotlarski lemma, if $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$, and $\xi_3$ are independent real-valued random variables with nonvanishing characteristic functions, $L_1=\xi_1-\xi_3$ and $L_2=\xi_2-\xi_3$, then the distribution of the random vector $(L_1, L_2)$ determines the distributions of the random variables $\xi_j$ up to shift. Siran Li and Xunjie Zheng generalized this result for the linear forms $L_1=\xi_1+a_2\xi_2+a_3\xi_3$ and $L_2=b_2\xi_2+b_3\xi_3+\xi_4$ assuming that all $\xi_j$ have first and second moments, $\xi_2$ and $\xi_3$ are identically distributed, and $a_j$, $b_j$ satisfy some conditions. In the article, we give a simpler proof of this theorem. In doing so, we also prove that the condition of existence of moments can be omitted. Moreover, we prove an analogue of the Li--Zheng theorem for independent random variables with values in the field of $p$-adic numbers, in the field of integers modulo $p$, where $p\ne 2$, and in the discrete field of rational numbers.</description>

      <title>It\=o and It\=o-Wentzell chain rule for flows of conditional laws of continuous semimartingales: an easy approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general It\=o\,-Wentzell formula for a random field of maps on the Wasserstein space of probability measures, defined by continuous semimartingales, and evaluated along the flow of conditional distributions of another continuous semimartingale. Our method follows standard arguments of It\=o calculus, and thus bypasses the approximation by empirical measures commonly used in the existing literature. As an application, we derive the dynamic programming equation for a mean field stochastic control problem with common noise.</description>

      <title>The spatial average of solutions to SPDEs is asymptotically independent of the solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\left(u(t,x), t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb{R}^d\right)$ be the solution to the stochastic heat or wave equation driven by a Gaussian noise which is white in time and white or correlated with respect to the spatial variable. We consider the spatial average of the solution $F_{R}(t)= \frac{1}{\sigma_R}\int_{\vert x\vert \leq R} \left( u(t,x)-1\right) dx$, where $\sigma^2_R= \mathbf{E} \left(\int_{\vert x\vert \leq R} \left( u(t,x)-1\right) dx\right)^2$. It is known that, when $R$ goes to infinity, $F_R(t)$ converges in law to a standard Gaussian random variable $Z$. We show that the spatial average $F_R(t)$ is actually asymptotic independent by the solution itself, at any time and at any point in space, meaning that the random vector $(F_R(t), u(t, x_0))$ converges in distribution, as $R\to \infty$, to $(Z,  u(t, x_0))$, where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable independent of $u(t, x_0)$. By using the Stein-Malliavin calculus, we also obtain the rate of convergence, under the Wasserstein distance, for this limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Ito's formula for flows of conditional measures on semimartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent development of mean-field systems with common noise, this paper establishes Ito's formula for flows of conditional probability measures under a common filtration associated with general semimartingales. This generalizes existing works on flows of conditional measures on Ito processes and flows of deterministic measure on general semimartingales. The key technical components involve constructing conditional independent copies and establishing the equivalence between stochastic integrals with respect to the conditional law of semimartingales and the conditional expectation of stochastic integrals with respect to copies of semimartingales. Ito's formula is then established for cylindrical functions through conditional independent copies, and extended to the general case through function approximations.</description>

      <title>Relating bubble sort to birthday problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birthday problem is a well-known classic problem in probability theory widely applied in cryptography. Although bubble sort is a popular algorithm leading to some interesting theoretical problems in computer science, its relation to birthday problem has not been found yet. This paper indicates how Rayleigh distribution naturally arises in bubble sort by relating it to birthday problem, which presents a novel direction for analysing bubble sort and birthday problem. Then asymptotic distributions and statistical characteristics of bubble sort and birthday problem with very small absolute errors are presented. Moreover, this paper proves that some common optimizations of bubble sort could lead to average performance degradation.</description>

      <title>On the algebra of equal-input matrices in time-inhomogeneous Markov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov matrices of equal-input type constitute a widely used model class. The corresponding equal-input generators span an interesting subalgebra of the real matrices with zero row sums. Here, we summarise some of their amazing properties and discuss the corresponding Markov embedding problem, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous in time. In particular, we derive exact and explicit solutions for time-inhomogeneous Markov flows with non-commuting generator families of equal-input type and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quantitative merging for time-inhomogeneous Markov chains in non-decreasing environments via functional inequalitities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-inhomogeneous Markov chains to obtain quantitative results on their asymptotic behavior. We use Poincar\'e, Nash, and logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities. We assume that our Markov chain admits a finite invariant measure at each time and that the sequence of these invariant measures is non-decreasing. We deduce quantitative bounds on the merging time of the distributions for the chain started at two arbitrary points and we illustrate these new results with examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a planar random motion $\big(X(t),Y(t)\big)$ with orthogonal directions which can turn clockwise, counterclockwise and reverse its direction each with a different probability. The support of the process is given by a time-varying square and the singular distributions on the boundary and the diagonals of the square are obtained. In the interior of the support, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the distribution. We then investigate the time $T(t)$ spent by the process moving vertically and the joint distribution of $\big(T(t),Y(t)\big)$. We prove that, in the hydrodynamic limit, the process $\big(X(t),Y(t)\big)$ spends half the time moving vertically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution.</description>

      <title>Non-linear conductances of Galton-Watson trees and application to the (near) critical random cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When considering statistical mechanics models on trees, such that the Ising model, percolation, or more generally the random cluster model, some concave tree recursions naturally emerge. Some of these recursions can be compared with non-linear conductances, or $p$-conductances, between the root and the leaves of the tree. In this article, we estimate the $p$-conductances of $T_n$, a supercritical Galton-Watson tree of depth $n$, for any $p&gt;1$ (for a quenched realization of $T_n$). In particular, we find the sharp asymptotic behavior when $n$ goes to infinity, which depends on whether the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $q$, where $q=\frac{p}{p-1}$ is the conjugate exponent of $p$. We then apply our results to the random cluster model on~$T_n$ (with wired boundary condition) and provide sharp estimates on the probability that the root is connected to the leaves. As an example, for the Ising model on $T_n$ with plus boundary conditions on the leaves, we find that, at criticality, the quenched magnetization of the root decays like: (i) $n^{-1/2}$ times an explicit tree-dependent constant if the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $3$; (ii) $n^{-1/(\alpha-1)}$ if the offspring distribution has a heavy tail with exponent $\alpha \in (1,3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonnegative real function f is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth derivative of f changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... Similarly, a two-sided nonnegative sequence a(k) is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth iterated difference of a(k) changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... A characterisation of bell-shaped functions was given by Thomas Simon and the first named author, and recently a similar result for one-sided bell-shaped sequences was found by the authors. In the present article we give a complete description of two-sided bell-shaped sequences. Our main result proves that bell-shaped sequences are convolutions of P\'olya frequency sequences and what we call absolutely monotone-then-completely monotone sequences, and it provides an equivalent, and relatively easy to verify, condition in terms of holomorphic extensions of the generating function.</description>

Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a new set of tools for the study of discrete and continuous $\beta$-corners processes. In the continuous setting, our work provides a multi-level extension of the loop equations (also called Schwinger-Dyson equations) for $\beta$-log gases obtained by Borot and Guionnet in (Commun. Math. Phys. 317, 447-483, 2013). In the discrete setting, our work provides a multi-level extension of the loop equations (also called Nekrasov equations) for discrete $\beta$-ensembles obtained by Borodin, Gorin and Guionnet in (Publications math{\' e}matiques de l'IH{\' E}S 125, 1-78, 2017).</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the construction of a stochastic process called ``$\delta$-dimensional Bessel house-moving" and its properties. We study the weak convergence of $\delta$-dimensional Bessel bridges conditioned from above, and we refer to this limit as $\delta$-dimensional Bessel house-moving. Applying this weak convergence result, we give the decomposition formula for its distribution and the Radon-Nikodym density for the distribution of the Bessel house-moving with respect to the one of the Bessel process. We also prove that $\delta$-dimensional Bessel house-moving is a $\delta$-dimensional Bessel process hitting a fixed point for the first time at $t=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for the study of the genealogy of neutral discrete-time populations. We remove the standard assumption of exchangeability of offspring distributions appearing in Cannings' models, and replace it by a less restrictive condition of non-heritability of reproductive success. We provide a general criterion for the weak convergence of their genealogies to $\Xi$-coalescents, and apply it to a simple parametrization of our scenario (which, under mild conditions, we also prove to essentially include the general case). We provide examples for such populations, including models with highly-asymmetric offspring distributions and populations undergoing random but recurrent bottlenecks. Finally we study the limit genealogy of a new exponential model which, as previously shown for related models and in spite of its built in (fitness) inheritance mechanism, can be brought into our setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the elephant random walk in arbitrary dimension $d\geq 1$. Our main focus is the limiting random variable appearing in the superdiffusive regime. Building on a link between the elephant random walk and P\'olya-type urn models, we prove a fixed-point equation (or system in dimension two and larger) for the limiting variable. Based on this, we deduce several properties of the limit distribution, such as the existence of a density with support on $\mathbb R^d$ for $d\in\{1,2,3\}$, and we bring evidence for a similar result for $d\geq 4$. We also investigate the moment-generating function of the limit and give, in dimension $1$, a non-linear recurrence relation for the moments.</description>

Abstract: Contraction in Wasserstein 1-distance with explicit rates is established for generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with stochastic gradients under possibly nonconvex conditions. The algorithms considered include splitting schemes of kinetic Langevin diffusion. As consequence, quantitative Gaussian concentration bounds are provided for empirical averages. Convergence in Wasserstein 2-distance and total variation are also given, together with numerical bias estimates.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of diffusions on the lattice ${\mathbf Z}^d$ with periodic drift coefficients; Application of logarithmic Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A homogenization problem of infinite dimensional diffusion processes indexed by ${\mathbf Z}^d$ having periodic drift coefficients is considered. By an application of the uniform ergodic theorem for infinite dimensional diffusion processes based on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, an homogenization property of the processes starting from an almost every arbitrary point in the state space with respect to an invariant measure is proved. This result is also interpreted as solution to a homogenization problem of infinite dimensional diffusions with random coefficients, which is essentially analogous to the known ones in finite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Estimates of stability with respect to the number of summands for distributions of successive sums of independent identically distributed vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\dots, X_n,\dots$ be i.i.d.\ $d$-dimensional random vectors with common distribution $F$. Then $S_n = X_1+\dots+X_n$ has distribution $F^n$ (degree is understood in the sense of convolution). Let $$ \rho_{\mathcal{C}_d}(F,G) = \sup_A |F\{A\} - G\{A\}|, $$ where the supremum is taken over all convex subsets of $\mathbb R^d$. Basic result is as follows. For any nontrivial distribution $F$ there is $c_1(F)$ such that $$ \rho_{\mathcal{C}_d}(F^n, F^{n+1})\leq \frac{c_1(F)}{\sqrt n} $$ for any natural $n$. The distribution $F$ is called trivial if it is concentrated on a hyperplane that does not contain the origin. Clearly, for such $F$ $$ \rho_{\mathcal{C}_d}(F^n, F^{n+1}) = 1. $$ A similar result for the Prokhorov distance is also obtained. For any $d$-dimensional distribution~$F$ there is a $c_2(F)&gt;0$ that depends only on $F$ and such that \begin{multline}\nonumber (F^n)\{A\}\le (F^{n+1})\{A^{c_2(F)}\}+\frac{c_2(F)}{\sqrt{n}} \text{and}\quad (F^{n+1})\{A\}\leq (F^n)\{A^{c_2(F)}\}+\frac{c_2(F)} {\sqrt{n}} \end{multline} for any Borel set $ A $ for all positive integers $n$. Here $A^{\varepsilon }$ is $ \varepsilon $-neighborhood of the set $ A $.</description>

      <title>On $q$-Order Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the notion of $q$-integral introduced by Thomae in 1869, we introduce $q$-order statistics (that, is $q$-analogues of the classical order statistics, for $0&lt;q&lt;1$) which arise from dependent and not identically distributed $q$-continuous random variables and study their distributional properties. We study the $q$-distribution functions and the $q$-density functions of the relative $q$-ordered random variables. We focus on $q$-ordered variables arising from dependent and not identically $q$-uniformly distributed random variables and we derive their $q$-distributions, including $q$-power law, $q$-beta and $q$-Dirichlet distributions.</description>

      <title>Scaled quadratic variation for controlled rough paths and parameter estimation of fractional diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation along a sequence of partitions for paths on a given interval. This concept, with historical roots in the study of Gaussian processes by Gladyshev (1961) and Klein \&amp; Gin\'e (1975), includes the fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with Hurst index $H$, which has finite $1-2H$-scaled quadratic variation. We show that a path that is controlled by a path with finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation in the sense of M. Gubinelli inherits this property, and the corresponding scaled quadratic variation satisfies an It\^o-isometry type formula. Moreover, we prove quantitative error bounds that establish a relationship between the convergence rates of the scaled quadratic variation of the controlled path and that of the controlling path. Additionally, we introduce a consistent estimator for the parameter $\gamma$ based on a single sample path, complete with quantitative error bounds. We apply these results to the parameter estimation for fractional diffusions. Our findings specify convergence rates for the estimation of both the Hurst index and the parameters in the noise vector fields. The paper concludes with numerical experiments that substantiate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Quenched universality for deformed Wigner matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following E. Wigner's original vision, we prove that sampling the eigenvalue gaps within the bulk spectrum of a fixed (deformed) Wigner matrix $H$ yields the celebrated Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universal statistics with high probability. Similarly, we prove universality for a monoparametric family of deformed Wigner matrices $H+xA$ with a deterministic Hermitian matrix $A$ and a fixed Wigner matrix $H$, just using the randomness of a single scalar real random variable $x$. Both results constitute quenched versions of bulk universality that has so far only been proven in annealed sense with respect to the probability space of the matrix ensemble.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for place dependent idempotent iterated function systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the set of invariant idempotent probabilities for place dependent idempotent iterated function systems defined in compact metric spaces. Using well-known ideas from dynamical systems, such as the Ma\~{n}\'{e} potential and the Aubry set, we provide a complete characterization of the densities of such idempotent probabilities. As an application, we provide an alternative formula for the attractor of a class of fuzzy iterated function systems.</description>

      <title>Relating absorbing and hard wall boundary conditions for a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection between absorbing boundary conditions and hard walls is well established in the mathematical literature for a variety of stochastic models, including for instance the Brownian motion. In this paper we explore this duality for a different type of process which is of particular interest in physics and biology, namely the run-tumble-particle, a toy model of active particle. For a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary external force, we provide a duality relation between the exit probability, i.e. the probability that the particle exits an interval from a given boundary before a certain time $t$, and the cumulative distribution of its position in the presence of hard walls at the same time $t$. We show this relation for a run-and-tumble particle in the stationary state by explicitly computing both quantities. At finite time, we provide a derivation using the Fokker-Planck equation. All the results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>
