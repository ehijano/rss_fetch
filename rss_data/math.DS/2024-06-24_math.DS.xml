      <title>A macroscopic pedestrian model with variable maximal density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel macroscopic (fluid dynamics) model for describing pedestrian flow in low and high density regimes. The model is characterized by the fact that the maximal density reachable by the crowd - usually a fixed model parameter - is instead a state variable. To do that, the model couples a conservation law, devised as usual for tracking the evolution of the crowd density, with a Burgers-like PDE with a nonlocal term describing the evolution of the maximal density. The variable maximal density is used here to describe the effects of the psychological/physical pushing forces which are observed in crowds during competitive or emergency situations. Specific attention is also dedicated to the fundamental diagram, i.e., the function which expresses the relationship between crowd density and flux. Although the model needs a well defined fundamental diagram as known input parameter, it is not evident a priori which relationship between density and flux will be actually observed, due to the time-varying maximal density. An a posteriori analysis shows that the observed fundamental diagram has an elongated "tail" in the congested region, thus resulting similar to the concave/concave fundamental diagram with a "double hump" observed in real crowds.</description>

      <title>Multivariate extreme values for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a theory for multivariate extreme value analysis of dynamical systems. Namely, we provide conditions adapted to the dynamical setting which enable the study of dependence between extreme values of the components of $\R^d$-valued observables evaluated along the orbits of the systems. We study this cross-sectional dependence, which results from the combination of a spatial and a temporal dependence structures. We give several illustrative applications, where concrete systems and dependence sources are introduced and analysed.</description>

      <title>Assembly Procedure for Elementary Matrices of Train-Track-Bridge Railway System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to determine the dynamic response of the railway system composed of train, track and bridge, suggesting a method for assembling the elementary matrices to obtain differential equations of the overall system. The model studied consists of a moving part which is the vehicle modeled by a mass-spring-damper system, and a fixed part made up of the rail and bridge deck, modeled by two Bernoulli beams. The ballast layer of the rail bed is represented by springs and continuous dampers. The motion equations are established using the principle of total stationary potential energy in combination with the finite element method. The Newmark method was used to solve the motion equations, whose coefficients depend on time. It is an explicit numerical integration method with unconditional stability and high accuracy, which does not involve any iterative procedure. The concept of the method is explained herein and applied to the railway system studied. A computer program was developed on MATLAB software to analyze the system's dynamic responses. The assembly procedure presented, and the numerical method used to solve the equations in the time domain have been validated there an illustrated example in literature.</description>

      <title>Tracking nonautonomous attractors in singularly perturbed systems of ODEs with dependence on the fast time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New results on the behaviour of the fast motion in slow-fast systems of ODEs with dependence on the fast time are given in terms of tracking of nonautonomous attractors. Under quite general assumptions, including the uniform ultimate boundedness of the solutions of the layer problems, inflated pullback attractors are considered. In general, one cannot disregard the inflated version of the pullback attractor, but it is possible under the continuity of the fiber projection map of the attractor. %In particular this happens when the attractors of the layer problems are copies of the base, which is the counterpart of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point in the autonomous case. The problem of the limit of the solutions of the slow-fast system at each fixed positive value of the slow time is also treated and in this formulation the critical set is given by the union of the fibers of the pullback attractors. The results can be seen as extensions of the classical Tikhonov theorem to the nonautonomous setting.</description>

      <title>On the full centraliser of Erd\H{o}s $\cB$-free shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sets of $\cB$-free integers are considered with respect to (reversing) symmetries. It is well known that, for a large class of them, the centraliser of the associated $\cB$-free shift (otherwise known as its automorphism group) is trivial. We extend this result to the full centraliser, which effectively means to show that all self-homeomorphisms of the $\cB$-free shift that commute with some power of the shift are shifts themselves. This also leads to the result that the full normaliser agrees with the normaliser for this class, which is the semi-direct product of the centraliser with the cyclic group of order two generated by reflection.</description>

      <title>Algebraic characterization of dendricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dendric shift spaces simultaneously generalize codings of regular interval exchanges and episturmian shift spaces, themselves both generalizations of Sturmian words. One of the key properties enforced by dendricity is the Return Theorem. In this paper, we prove its converse, providing the following natural algebraic perspective on dendricity: A minimal shift space is dendric if and only if every set of return words is a basis of the free group over the alphabet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximate controllability of linear fractional impulsive evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We provide a representation of solutions utilizing impulsive operators. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of linear fractional impulsive evolution equations are established in terms of the impulsive resolvent operator. An example is presented to demonstrate the application of the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Thurston theory and transcendental dynamics II: classification of entire functions with escaping singular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10728v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify transcendental entire functions that are compositions of a polynomial and the exponential for which all singular values escape on disjoint rays. The construction involves an iteration procedure on an infinite-dimensional Teichm\"uller space, analogously to the Thurston's classical Topological Characterization of Rational Functions, but for an infinite set of marked points.</description>

      <title>A modified chemostat exhibiting competitive exclusion "reversal"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical chemostat is an intensely investigated model in ecology and bio/chemical engineering, where n-species, say $x_{1}, x_{2}...x_{n}$ compete for a single growth limiting nutrient. Classical theory predicts that depending on model parameters, one species competitively excludes all others. Furthermore, this ''order'' of strongest to weakest is preserved, $x_{1} &gt;&gt; x_{2} &gt;&gt; ...x_{n}$, for say $D_{1} &lt; D_{2} &lt;...D_{n}$, where $D_{i}$ is the net removal of species $x_{i}$. Meaning $x_{1}$ is the strongest or most dominant species and $x_{n}$ is the weakest or least dominant. We propose a modified version of the classical chemostat, exhibiting certain counterintuitive dynamics. Herein we show that if only a certain proportion of the weakest species $x_{n}$'s population is removed at a ''very'' fast density dependent rate, it will in fact be able to competitively exclude all other species, for certain initial conditions. Numerical simulations are carried out to visualize these dynamics in the three species case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Chen, Erchenko and Gogolev have proven that if a Riemannian manifold with boundary has hyperbolic geodesic trapped set, then it can be embedded into a compact manifold whose geodesic flow is Anosov. They have to introduce some assumptions that we discuss here. We explain how some can be removed, obtaining in particular a result applicable to all reasonable 3 dimensional examples.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent investigations of Sophie Grivaux and \'Etienne Matheron on the existence of invariant measures in Linear Dynamics, we introduce the concept of locally bounded orbit for a continuous linear operator $T:X\longrightarrow X$ acting on a Fr\'echet space $X$, and we use this new notion to construct (non-trivial) $T$-invariant probability Borel measures on $(X,\mathscr{B}(X))$.</description>

      <title>Uniform property $\Gamma$ and the small boundary property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for an action $\alpha \colon G \curvearrowright X$ of a countably infinite discrete amenable group on a compact metric space, the small boundary property is implied by uniform property $\Gamma$ of the Cartan subalgebra $(C(X) \subseteq C(X) \rtimes_\alpha G)$. The reverse implication has been demonstrated by Kerr and Szab\'o for free actions, from which we obtain the equivalence of the two conditions in the free case. We moreover show that, if $\alpha$ is free and minimal, then almost finiteness of $\alpha$ is implied by tracial $\mathcal{Z}$-stability of the subalgebra $(C(X) \subseteq C(X) \rtimes_\alpha G)$. The reverse implication is due to Kerr, resulting in the equivalence of these two properties as well. As an application, we prove that if $\alpha \colon G \curvearrowright X$ and $\beta \colon H \curvearrowright Y$ are free actions and $\alpha$ has the small boundary property, then $\alpha \times \beta \colon G \times H \curvearrowright X \times Y$ has the small boundary property. An analogous permanence property is obtained for almost finiteness in case $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are free minimal actions.</description>

      <title>Prescribed exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network with delayed feedback: Insights in seizure prevention and neural control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides control-oriented delay-based modelling of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield-type subject to an external input designed as delayed feedback. The specificity of such a model is that it makes the considered neuron less susceptible to seizure caused by its inherent dynamic instability. This modelling exploits a recently set partial pole placement for linear functional differential equations, which relies on the coexistence of real spectral values, allowing the explicit prescription of the closed-loop solution's exponential decay. The proposed framework improves some pioneering and scarce results from the literature on the characterization of the exact solution's exponential decay when a simple real spectral value exists. Indeed, it improves neural stability when the inherent dynamic is stable and provides insights into the design of a one-layer neural network that can be stabilized exponentially with delayed feedback and with a prescribed decay rate regardless of whether the inherent neuron dynamic is stable or unstable.</description>
