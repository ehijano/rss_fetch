      <title>Emergent heavy-fermion physics in a new family of topological insulators RAsS (R = Y, La, and Sm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing topological phases in strongly correlated materials has become a major impetus in condensed matter physics. Although many compounds are now classified as topological insulators, $f$-electron systems (with their strong electron correlations) provide an especially fertile platform for emergent heavy-fermion phenomena driven by the interplay of topology and many-body effects. In this study, we examine the crystalline topology of a new RAsS series (R = Y, La, Sm), revealing a structural variant from previous reports. We demonstrate that YAsS and SmAsS host hourglass fermions protected by glide symmetry. SmAsS notably exhibits a strong effective-mass enhancement, placing it alongside SmB${}_6$ and YbB${}_{12}$ as a material that couples topological surface states with emergent Kondo physics, yet distinguished by its crystalline symmetry constraints and $f$-$p$ orbital hybridization. To capture these features, we construct a minimal model incorporating $f$-electron degrees of freedom, which reproduces the observed topological properties and predicts that the surface states survive in the correlated regime, albeit shifted in energy. Our work thus introduces a new family of correlated topological materials and forecasts the robustness of their surface states under Kondo correlations.</description>

      <title>Ferroelasticity, shear modulus softening, and the tetragonal-cubic transition in davemaoite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Davemaoite (Dm), the cubic phase of CaSiO3-perovskite (CaPv), is a major component of the Earth's lower mantle. Understanding its elastic behavior, including its dissolution in bridgmanite (MgSiO3-perovskite), is crucial for interpreting lower mantle seismology. Using machine-learning interatomic potentials and molecular dynamics, we investigate CaPv's elastic properties across the tetragonal-cubic transition. Our equations of state align well with experimental data at 300 K and 2,000 K, demonstrating the predictive accuracy of our trained potential. We simulate the ferroelastic hysteresis loop in tetragonal CaPv, which has yet to be investigated experimentally. We also identify a significant temperature-induced shear modulus softening near the phase transition, characteristic of ferroelastic-paraelastic transitions. Unlike previous elasticity studies, our softening region does not extend to slab geotherm conditions. We suggest that ab initio-quality computations provide a robust benchmark for shear elastic softening associated with ferroelasticity, a challenging property to measure in these materials.</description>

      <title>A Unified Simulation Framework for Correlated Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.</description>

      <title>Robust electro-mechanical actuation in hydrogenated Xenes leading to reversible topological transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report from first principles, the possibility of reversible onset of topological insulator(TI) phase in heavier hydrogenated Xenes (Xane), namely, germanane and stanane, exclusively through in-plane electro-mechanical actuation. It is found possible to systematically induce robust uniaxial strain through non-uniform application of electric field in the plane of monolayers, as possible through application of in-homogeneous bias at gates of realizable length-scales embedded underneath. Electrically induced strain causes substantial lowering of band-gap across all Xanes, eventually evolving through weak followed by strong topologically insulating phases beyond a threshold degree of bias in-homogeneity in heavier Xanes, promisingly within the range of bias sustained by the monolayers. In case of nano-ribbons of these Xanes, bias applied in-homogeneously across width promises switchable emergence of TI phase over a fraction of width and topologically protected interface states localizable anywhere across the half-width of the ribbon. The demonstrated electro-mechanical actuation and the associated topological tuning of band-structure, thematically verified in gapped graphene based representative systems within the Kane-Mele model at half-filling, should be possible in the broader class of two dimensional covalent networks made of elements of the p-block.</description>

      <title>Analytical Gradient-Based Optimization of CALPHAD Model Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) models involves the solution of a very challenging high-dimensional multiobjective optimization problem. Traditional approaches to parameter fitting predominantly rely on gradient-free methods, which while robust, are computationally inefficient and often scale poorly with model complexity. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate a generalizable framework for analytic gradient-based optimization of the parameters of the CALPHAD model enabled by the recently formalized Jansson derivative technique. This method allows for efficient evaluation of gradients of thermodynamic properties at equilibrium with respect to model parameters, even in the presence of arbitrarily complex internal degrees of freedom. Leveraging these semi-analytic gradients, we employ the conjugate gradient (CG) method to optimize thermodynamic model parameters for four binary alloy systems: Cu-Mg, Fe-Ni, Cr-Ni, and Cr-Fe. Across all systems, CG achieves comparable or superior optimality relative to Bayesian ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with improvements in computational efficiency ranging from one to three orders of magnitude. Our results establish a new paradigm for CALPHAD assessments in which high fidelity data-rich model calibration becomes tractable using deterministic gradient-informed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Leakage Suppression Across Temperature in Al1-xScxN Thin Film Ferroelectric Capacitors through Boron Incorporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents high-temperature ferroelectric characterization of 40~nm Al$_{1-x-y}$B$_x$Sc$_y$N (AlBScN) thin film capacitors grown by co-sputtering Al$_{0.89}$B$_{0.11}$ and Sc targets onto Pt(111)/Ti(002)/Si(100) substrates. Structural analysis confirmed a c-axis-oriented wurtzite structure with a low surface roughness of 1.37~nm. Ferroelectric switching, characterized by positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements up to 600~$^\circ$C, exhibited a linear decrease in coercive fields from 6.2~MV/cm at room temperature to 4.2~MV/cm at 600~$^\circ$C, while remanent polarization remained stable with temperature. Direct current I-V measurements highlight a significant suppression of leakage currents, over two orders of magnitude lower compared to AlScN capacitors fabricated under similar conditions. These results position AlBScN thin films as strong candidates for ferroelectric applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the interplay of magnetic order and electronic band structure on the evolution of anomalous Hall effect in MnPtGa single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent studies on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) have revealed an intrinsic relationship between the topological band structure and the experimentally observed transverse conductivity. Consequently, this has led to a heightened focus on examining the topological aspects of AHE. Here we have studied sign reversal of anomalous Hall conductivity with temperature in the single crystalline MnPtGa (space group: $P6_3/mmc$). From the interdependence of the linear resistance, we claim that the origin of such behavior is intrinsic. By systematically studying the electronic band structure and Berry curvature of MnPtGa using first principle calculations supported by magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization measurements we demonstrate that the temperature dependent complex magnetic structure plays a significant role and leads to the sign reversal of anomalous Hall conductivity. We proposed a continuous evolution of the magnetic structure, supported by the ab initio calculations, which is consistent with the experimental data. Our studies have established that the critical temperature ($\approx$110 K), where the sign reversal appears is associated with the magnetic structure and the magnitude of Mn moments.</description>

      <title>Decoding Vibrational Signatures of Molybdenum Sulphide Molecular Catalysts for Solar Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, have emerged as key molecular models for understanding active sites in Mo-S-based catalysts and as promising candidates for energy conversion applications. Despite their importance, comprehensive vibrational characterization of these clusters remains limited. Here, we present a detailed Raman and infrared spectroscopic analysis of both clusters, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-quality crystalline samples were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm morphology and stoichiometry. Raman spectra, acquired using 488 nm and 532 nm laser excitation, were deconvoluted using Lorentzian fitting. Vibrational mode assignments were made through direct comparison with DFT predictions. For [Mo3S4]4+, major Raman bands appear near 200 cm^-1, 350 cm^-1, and 450 cm^-1, corresponding to Mo-S-Mo bending, Mo-S stretching, and terminal sulfur vibrations. [Mo3S13]2- shows two distinct spectral regions: 100-400 cm^-1 for Mo-S and S-S bending and stretching, and 450-550 cm^-1 for terminal disulfide (S-S) stretching. Complementary IR spectra calculations reveal additional vibrational features, yielding a more complete fingerprint for each cluster. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy offers greater sensitivity than X-ray diffraction (XRD) in detecting these clusters on supporting materials. This work provides a detailed vibrational reference for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, establishing Raman and IR spectroscopy as powerful tools for characterizing Mo-S molecular clusters in both fundamental and applied contexts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing atomic-resolution in electron microscopy: A frequency-domain deep learning denoiser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic resolution electron microscopy, particularly high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, has become an essential tool for many scientific fields, when direct visualization of atomic arrangements and defects are needed, as they dictate the material's functional and mechanical behavior. However, achieving this precision is often hindered by noise, arising from electron microscopy acquisition limitations, particularly when imaging beam-sensitive materials or light atoms. In this work, we present a deep learning-based denoising approach that operates in the frequency domain using a convolutional neural network U-Net trained on simulated data. To generate the training dataset, we simulate FFT patterns for various materials, crystallographic orientations, and imaging conditions, introducing noise and drift artifacts to accurately mimic experimental scenarios. The model is trained to identify relevant frequency components, which are then used to enhance experimental images by applying element-wise multiplication in the frequency domain. The model enhances experimental images by identifying and amplifying relevant frequency components, significantly improving signal-to-noise ratio while preserving structural integrity. Applied to both Ge quantum wells and WS2 monolayers, the method facilitates more accurate strain quantitative analyses, critical for assessing functional device performance (e.g. quantum properties in SiGe quantum wells), and enables the clear identification of light atoms in beam sensitive materials. Our results demonstrate the potential of automated frequency-based deep learning denoising as a useful tool for atomic-resolution nano-materials analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autferroics, recently proposed as a sister branch of multiferroics, exhibit strong intrinsic magnetoelectricity, but ferroelectricity and magnetism are mutually exclusive rather than coexisting. Here, a general model is considered based on the Landau theory, to clarify the distinction between multi and autferroics by qualitative change-rotation in Landau free energy landscape and in particular phase mapping. The TiGeSe$_3$ exemplifies a factual material, whose first-principles computed Landau coefficients predict its autferroicity. Our investigations pave the way for an alternative avenue in the pursuit of intrinsically strong magnetoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Strain-Balanced Low-Temperature-Grown Beryllium-Doped InGaAs/InAlAs Superlattices for High-Performance Terahertz Photoconductors under 1550 nm Laser Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the photoconductive properties of low-temperature-grown Beryllium (Be)-doped InGaAs/InAlAs strain-balanced superlattices (SLs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy under stationary growth conditions on semi-insulating InP:Fe substrates. The stationary growth approach enabled precise control over lateral gradients in layer strain, composition, and thickness across a single wafer, while strain-balancing facilitated pseudomorphic growth to explore a wide range of structural parameters, providing a robust platform to study their influence on photoconductive performance. Structural characterization confirmed high crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology in all samples. Time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy revealed subpicosecond carrier lifetimes, validating the effectiveness of strain balancing and Be doping in tuning ultrafast recombination dynamics. Hall effect measurements supported by 8-band k.p modeling revealed enhanced carrier mobility in strain-balanced SLs compared to lattice-matched structures, primarily due to reduced electron and hole effective masses and stronger quantum confinement. Additionally, optical absorption under 1550 nm excitation showed improved absorption coefficients for the strain-balanced structure, consistent with the reduction in bandgap energy predicted by theoretical modeling, thereby enhancing photon-to-carrier conversion efficiency. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy provided first-time evidence of significant Be-induced interdiffusion at the strained SL interfaces, an important factor influencing carrier transport and dynamics. These findings position low-temperature-grown Be-doped InGaAs/InAlAs strain-balanced SLs as promising materials for high-performance broadband THz photoconductive detectors operating at telecom-compatible wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Parameter Sensitivity Analysis in Zinc-Ion Batteries: A Study on Ionic Conductivity, Current Density, and Electrode Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive Multiphysics model for zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), incorporating electrochemical aspects. The model integrates the mass transport of Zn2+ ions, charge transfer, and solid diffusion to predict performance parameters like cell potential, and energy density. Significant research has focused on enhancing battery performance by optimizing components of battery to improve parameters such as ionic conductivity and exchange current density and capacity. In this study, we present a model-based investigation of zinc-ion batteries, examining the impact of these parameters. Our findings reveal that at low current densities, raising of ionic conductivity beyond 1.3 S/m and exchange current density above 0.13 mA/cm2 do not yield substantial improvements in capacity. These insights underscore the importance of identifying performance thresholds in the development of next-generation batteries.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable Energy Storage: Evaluating Polymer Electrolytes for Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes present a promising solution to the challenges posed by aqueous electrolytes in energy storage systems, offering the flexibility needed for wearable electronics. Despite the increasing interest in polymer electrolyte-based zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), their development is still in its early stages due to various challenges. In this study, we fabricated three promising polymer electrolytes: CSAM (carboxyl methyl chitosan with acrylamide monomer), PAM (polyacrylamide monomer hydrogel electrolyte), and p-PBI (Phosphoric acid (PA)-doped polybenzimidazole) with Zn(ClO4)2 and Zn(OTf)2, for their application in zinc ion batteries. Our results demonstrated that PAM hydrogel electrolyte exhibited very low LDH formation after a long cycle, demonstrating effective protection for zinc foil, and the high mechanical stability of the p-PBI membrane provided prolonged durability against short circuits through the formation of LDH. The presence of carboxyl groups in CSAM and the formation of O-H bonding facilitated ion movement, resulting in enhanced ionic conductivity, and preventing dendrite formation. Incorporating these hydrogels with high-performance zinc salts, such as zinc triflate (Zn(OTf)2), resulted in impressive stability, with the symmetric cell demonstrating over 4000 hours of uniform and stable voltage profile under 1 mA/cm2 and low overpotential of around 53 mV cycling with CSAM. The full-cell battery with PBI-T membrane showed the highest durability and capacity compared to CSAM-T and PAM-T, due to the greater availability of free protons for storing zinc in the cathode.</description>

      <title>Atomistic insight into the effects of solute and pressure on phase transformation in titanium alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase stability and transformation between hexagonal close-packed (hcp) {\alpha}-phase and body-centered cubic (bcc) \b{eta}-phase in titanium (Ti) alloys are critical to their mechanical properties and manufacturing processes for engineering applications. However, many factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic (e.g., solute elements and external pressures, respectively), may govern their phase transformations dynamically, which is crucial to the design of new Ti alloys with desirable properties. In this work, we study the effects of various solute elements and external hydrostatic pressures on the solid-state phase transformations in Ti alloys using density functional theory (DFT) and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations. The results show that both alloying and applied pressure reduce transformation barriers, with Al and Mo being most effective under ambient conditions, while Nb, V, Zr, and Sn show enhanced transformation kinetics under stress. Solute-induced modifications to the local electronic structure and bonding environment, particularly under pressure, contribute to variations in phase stability. We identify a synergistic interaction between solute effects and external stress, which facilitates phase transitions that are unachievable under static conditions. These findings provide atomistic insights into the coupled chemical-mechanical mechanisms underlying phase transformations in Ti alloys with improved phase stability and mechanical performance.</description>

      <title>Polar Indirect Valley as a Limiting Factor for Radiative Efficiency in Gold-Based Mixed-Valence Double Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double perovskites have emerged as promising alternatives to lead halide perovskites, aiming to mitigate challenges related to toxicity and chemical instability. Among them, mixed-valence gold halides such as Cs2Au+Au3+Cl6, which contain only a single type of metal cation in two oxidation states, stand out due to their unique structural and electronic properties. These materials exhibit strong absorption in the near-infrared range, making them attractive candidates for optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaics. In this work, we employ temperature-dependent optical spectroscopy techniques to demonstrate that these compounds exhibit particularly strong polar electron-phonon coupling, which has a profound impact on their optoelectronic properties. In particular, this coupling gives rise to a temperature-dependent absorption tail that reshapes the global spectral spectrum. We show that this tail leads to a forbidden band-egde recombination, which explains the reported difficulties in detecting a photoluminescence signal from this class of double perovskites.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Switching in Hybrid Molecular Beam Epitaxy-Grown BaTiO3 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a promising synthesis technique for both heterostructure growth and epitaxial integration of ferroelectric BaTiO3. However, a direct measurement of the remnant polarization (P_r) has not been previously reported in MBE-grown BaTiO3 films. We report the in-situ growth of an all-epitaxial SrRuO3/BaTiO3/SrRuO3 heterostructure on Nb-doped SrTiO3 (001) substrates by hybrid MBE using metal-organic precursors. This capacitor structure consisting of 16 nm SrRuO3/40 nm BaTiO3/16 nm SrRuO3 shows hysteretic polarization-electric field (P-E) curves with P_r = 15 {\mu}C cm-2 at frequencies ranging from 500 Hz to 20 kHz, after isolating the intrinsic ferroelectric response from non-ferroelectric contributions using the Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND) method. We hypothesize that the asymmetry in switching behavior and current leakage has origins in structural defects.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic type-II Multiferroics with N\'{e}el-order-locked Electric Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, an emergent magnetic phase featuring compensated collinear magnetic moments and momentum-dependent spin splittings, has recently garnered widespread interest. A pivotal issue concerns whether the unconventional spin structures can generate spontaneous electric polarization in altermagnets, thereby achieving type-II multiferroicity. Here, with the combination of symmetry analysis and microscopic theory, we explicitly demonstrate the generation of electric polarization by altermagnetic N\'eel order, and establish a microscopic mechanism of N\'eel-order-locked electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics. We further reveal these pronounced magnetoelectric coupling behaviors and classify them into eight distinct categories for two-dimensional altermagnets governed by layer group symmetries. Then we take monolayer MgFe$_2$N$_2$ as a prototypical example of altermagnetic multiferroics by first-principles calculations. We also propose to identify the N\'eel order orientation and accompanying electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics by magneto-optical microscopy. Bridging type-II multiferroics and altermagnets, our work could pave the way for altermagnetic multifunctional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin and orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects induced by a femtosecond laser pulse: Simulations for Au(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinctive surface and interface phenomena, such as spin-momentum locking and spin splitting. In nonequilibrium settings, one of the key manifestations is the (Rashba-)Edelstein effect, where an electric current generates a net spin or orbital polarization perpendicular to the current direction. While the steady-state behavior of these effects is well studied, their dynamics on ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast spin and orbital Edelstein effects on an Au(001) surface, triggered by excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse. These effects are intrinsic and inherently nonlinear. Using a real-space tight-binding model combined with time evolution governed by the von Neumann equation, we simulate the electron dynamics in response to the pulse. Our results reveal pronounced differences between the spin and orbital responses, offering detailed insights into their distinct temporal profiles and magnitudes. We further explore the associated charge, spin, and orbital currents, including the emergence of laser-induced spin and orbital Hall effects. Finally, we quantify the angular momentum transfer mediated by the light-matter interaction. These findings shed light on the intricate ultrafast dynamics driven by spin-orbit coupling and offer guidance for the design of next-generation spintronic and orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Diffuson-Dominated Thermal Transport Crossover from Ordered to Liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$:The Negligible Role of Ion Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamentally understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport behavior in liquid-like, partially occupied compounds remains a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying the ultralow thermal conductivity in ordered/liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ by combining experimental methods with first-principles calculations. We first experimentally synthesize and characterize the ordered structure and liquid-like, partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with increasing temperature. We then combine self-consistent phonon calculations, including bubble-diagram corrections, with the Wigner transport equation, considering both phonon propagation and diffuson contributions, to evaluate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity in phase-change Cu$_3$BiS$_3$. Our theoretical model predicts an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.34 W/m/K at 400 K, dominated by diffuson contributions, which accurately reproduces and explains the experimental data. Importantly, the machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only reproduced the partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with the space group $\mathrm{P2_12_12_1}$ but also successfully replicated the thermal conductivity obtained from experiments and Wigner transport calculations. This observation highlights the negligible impact of ionic mobility arising from partially occupied Cu sites on the thermal conductivity in diffuson-dominated thermal transport compounds. Our work not only sheds light on the minimal impact of ionic mobility on ultralow thermal conductivity in phase-change materials but also demonstrates that the Wigner transport equation accurately describes thermal transport behavior in partially occupied phases with diffuson-dominant thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Construction of First Principle Based Adiabatic and Diabatic Hamiltonian for TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit of BaTiO$_3$ Crystal: Photoemission Spectra and Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferroelectric property of BaTiO$_3$ crystal arises from the strong Pseudo Jahn-Teller (PJT) interactions between the non-degenerate ground electronic state, $^1A_{1g}$ and the degenerate $^1T_{1u}$ symmetry states through the nuclear distortions of $t_{1u}$ modes in TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit. In a $d^0$ electronic configuration of $Ti^{4+}$ ion, the PJT interaction leads to a stabilization effect, which has been explored using Beyond Born-Oppenheimer (BBO) theory. The $^1T_{1u}$ excited states form a three-state degeneracy, exhibiting feeble Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions over the $t_{2g}$ planes. For the first time, we compute \textit{ab initio} adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and non-adiabatic coupling terms (NACTs), and thereafter, diabatic PESs and couplings for the perovskite unit, TiO$_6^{8-}$. Using a Time-Dependent Discrete Variable Representation (TDDVR) approach, the theoretical photoemission spectra exhibit good agreement with the experimental ones. Moreover, the experimental observation on order parameter associated with ferroelectric properties of BaTiO$_3$ crystal show close resemblance with present and other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The storage mechanism and diffusion kinetics of Na$_{3}$V$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$F$_{3}$/C ($x=$ 0--0.07) cathodes are investigated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the samples are prepared through the facile pH-assisted sol-gel route and crystallize in the P4$_{2}$/mnm symmetry. The optimal doping of Ni ($x=$ 0.05) exhibits superior specific capacities of 119 and 100 mAh g$^{-1}$ at 0.1 C and 10 C rates, respectively, along the excellent capacity retention of 78\% after 2000 cycles at 10 C rate with nearly 100\% Coulombic efficiency. The apparent diffusion coefficient values are found to be in the range of 10$^{-9}$--10$^{-10}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ through detailed analysis of CV and GITT. Moreover, we report the reversible structural evolution and morphological changes during charging and discharging under non-equilibrium conditions through the {\it operando} X-ray diffraction and the {\it in-situ} synchrotron based transmission X-ray microscopy, respectively. Further, to understand the stability mechanism and obtain precise polarization values, we performed the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis using the EIS data. The structure and morphology are found to be stable after long cycling.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional M2X2 family with emerging semiconducting, semimetallic, and magnetic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration for novel two-dimensional (2D) materials with diverse electronic characteristics has attracted growing interest in recent years. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have predicted a new family of 2D transition-metal (TM) based compounds under the nomenclature M_2X_2 (where M represents TMs, and X denotes chalcogen elements like S, Se, and Te). Our investigation delves into the examination of the formation energies, dynamical/thermal stabilities, mechanical properties, electronic structures, and magnetic properties of various systems within this family. Through our computational analyses, we have discovered a total of 35 thermodynamically and dynamically stable M_2X_2 monolayer materials that exhibit remarkable diversity in terms of their electronic and magnetic properties. Our findings will pave the way for the experimental realization of various M_2X_2 structures in the near future. In particular, among the predicted compounds, M_2X_2(M=Zn, Cd; X=S, Se, Te) are a direct band-gap semiconductor with band gaps between 0.9 to 2.6 eV (1.3 to 3.7 eV) by DFT+PBE (hybrid functional HSE) calculations. M_2X_2(M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Tc, Re) are zero-gap semiconductor (semimetals) in standard DFT+PBE calculation. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling leads to a gap opening of 0.1 eV. Notably, our analysis has also unveiled the magnetic nature of certain materials, such as Mn_2X_2(X=S, Se), Fe_2X_2(X=Se, Te), and Ti_2Te_2. The prediction of semiconducting (magnetic) M_2X_2 materials not only offers valuable insights into the underlying electronic properties (magnetism) of 2D systems but also positions these materials as promising candidates for the development of advanced electronic (spintronic) devices.</description>

      <title>Simple scaling rules governing work functions of two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that values of work functions W for a variety of planar and buckled two-dimensional (2D) materials scale linearly as a function of the quantity 1/r_{WS}, where r_{WS} is the Wigner-Seitz radius for a 2D material. Simple procedures are prescribed for estimating r_{WS}. Using them, this linear scaling relation, which is founded in electrostatics, provides a quick and easy method for calculating values of W from basic, readily available structural information about the materials. These easily determined values of W are seen to be very accurate when compared to values from the literature. Those derive from experiment or from challenging, computationally intensive density-functional-theory calculations. Values from those sources also conform to the linear scaling rules. Since values of W predicted by the rules so closely match known values of W, the simple scaling methods described here also are applied to predict W for 2D materials (TiN, BSb, SiGe, and GaP) for which no values have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>2D van der Waals magnets: from fundamental physics to applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism has played a central role in the long and rich history of modern condensed matter physics, with many foundational insights originating from theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) spin systems. The discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets has revolutionized this area by providing real, atomically thin magnetic systems for experimental investigation. Since the first experimental reports of antiferromagnetic vdW insulators in 2016 - followed by studies on ferromagnetic vdW systems in 2017 - the field has witnessed rapid and expansive growth, with more than two dozen vdW magnetic materials now identified, including both ferro- and antiferromagnets. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the major scientific and technological developments in this rapidly evolving field. These include experimental realizations of various 2D spin Hamiltonians as well as unexpected phenomena such as magnetic excitons, Floquet-engineered states, and light-induced metastable magnetic phases. In parallel, 2D vdW magnets have shown significant promise in spintronics and related applications, offering a new platform for engineering quantum functionalities. We organize this review by tracing the historical development of the field, synthesizing key milestones, and highlighting its broader impact across condensed matter physics and materials science. We conclude with an Outlook section that outlines several promising directions for future research, aiming to chart a path forward in this vibrant and still rapidly growing area.</description>

      <title>Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework that predicts $G_0W_0$ quasiparticle energies across molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories with high accuracy and efficiency. Using only DFT-derived mean-field eigenvalues and exchange-correlation potentials, the model is trained on 25\% of MD snapshots and achieves RMSEs below 0.1 eV. It accurately reproduces k-resolved quasiparticle band structures and density of states, even for BN polymorphs excluded from the training data. This approach bypasses the computational bottlenecks of $G_0W_0$ simulations over dynamic configurations, offering a scalable route to excited-state electronic structure simulations with many-body accuracy.</description>

      <title>Electron density modulation in monolayer $MoS_{2}$ along the phase transition of a relaxor ferroelectric substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with ferroelectric substrates is a powerful strategy to modulate their electronic and optical properties. However, the use of relaxor ferroelectrics for this purpose remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a reversible photoluminescence (PL) and charge density modulation of monolayer $MoS_{2}$ on a $Sr_{0.61}Ba_{0.39}Nb_{2}O_{6}$ (SBN) substrate, a prototypical relaxor ferroelectric. The smearing of the phase transition in SBN enables continuous tuning of $MoS_{2}$ electronic properties over a broad temperature range ($30-90{\deg}C$). A pronounced PL enhancement occurs as the substrate transitions from ferro-to-paraelectric phase due to the vanishing spontaneous polarization and the consequent change in charge balance at the $MoS_{2}-SBN$ interface. Moreover, thermal hysteresis in the electron density modulation is observed during heating and cooling cycles. These findings highlight the potential of relaxor ferroelectrics as reconfigurable platforms for electron doping and light-emission control in 2D materials, opening avenues for temperature-responsive optoelectronic and nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning interatomic potentials from a users perspective: A comparison of accuracy, speed and data efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have massively changed the field of atomistic modeling. They enable the accuracy of density functional theory in large-scale simulations while being nearly as fast as classical interatomic potentials. Over the last few years, a wide range of different types of MLIPs have been developed, but it is often difficult to judge which approach is the best for a given problem setting. For the case of structurally and chemically complex solids, namely Al-Cu-Zr and Si-O, we benchmark a range of machine learning interatomic potential approaches, in particular, the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP), moment tensor potentials (MTP), the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) in its linear and nonlinear version, neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP), Allegro, and MACE. We find that nonlinear ACE and the equivariant, message-passing graph neural networks NequIP and MACE form the Pareto front in the accuracy vs. computational cost trade-off. In case of the Al-Cu-Zr system we find that MACE and Allegro offer the highest accuracy, while NequIP outperforms them for Si-O. Furthermore, GPUs can massively accelerate the MLIPs, bringing them on par with and even ahead of non-accelerated classical interatomic potentials (IPs) with regards to accessible timescales. Finally, we explore the extrapolation behavior of the corresponding potentials, probe the smoothness of the potential energy surfaces, and finally estimate the user friendliness of the corresponding fitting codes and molecular dynamics interfaces.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of the Long-Range Exact Exchange using an Extended Screening Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient screening for the Coulomb potential that also allows calculating approximated long-range exact exchange contributions with an accuracy similar to an explicit full-range evaluation of the exact exchange. Starting from the screening function of the HSE functional, i.e., the complementary error function, as zeroth order, a first-order Taylor expansion in terms of the screening parameter {\omega} is proposed as an approximation of the long-range Coulomb potential. The resulting extended screening function has a similar spatial extend as the complementary error function leading to a computational speed comparable to screened hybrid functionals such as HSE06, but with long-range exact exchange contributions included. The approach is tested and demonstrated for prototypical semiconductors and organic crystals using the PBE0 functional. Predicted energy band gaps, total energies, cohesive energies, and lattice energies from the first-order approximated PBE0 functional are close to those from the unmodified PBE0 functional, but are obtained at significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Studying the Seebeck coefficient and exploring the possibility of enhancing ZT upto 1.8 for NaCo$_2$O$_4$ in high temperature region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we have studied the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient (S) of the NaCo$_2$O$_4$ (NCO) by using experimental and computational methods. The range of experimentally obtained S is $\sim$55 to 103 $\mu$V/K in the temperature range of 300-600 K, which confirms the p-type behaviour of NCO. The electronic structure of this compound is obtained via DFT+U formalism. The band dispersion and partial density of states confirms the magnetic and half metallic nature. Furthermore, in the transport properties, the obtained S using a U = 4 eV gives the best match with experimental data. The temperature and chemical potential dependent S$^{2}$$\sigma$$/$$\tau$ is calculated using the obtained electronic transport properties, in which the maximum value obtained for p(n)-type doping is $\sim$22(61)$\times$10$^1$$^4$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The possibility of enhancing the ZT is identified, and it is calculated in temperature range 300-1200 K. The maximum calculated value of ZT is 0.64 for p-type and 1.8 for n-type doping at 1200 K. The calculated carrier concentration obtained for p(n) type doping at 1200 K is $\sim$1.17 (1.6)$\times$10$^2$$^2$ cm$^-$$^3$. This study suggests that the careful doping of p and n type can enhance the applicability of this compound in thermoelectric for high temperature application.</description>

      <title>Anomalous valley Hall effect in monolayer chromium-based triple-Q magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the density functional theory calculations, we predict that several monolayer chromium-based materials exhibit a triple-Q tetrahedral magnetic insulating ground state. By studying the effect of biaxial strain on monolayer CrSi$\rm{_2}$P$\rm{_4}$ under various on-site Coulomb interactions, we reveal that this magnetic insulating state, sandwiched between the itinerant $120^{\circ}$ coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, originates from the competition between antiferromagnetic exchange and double exchange interactions of Cr 3$d$ electrons which can also be applied to account for the ground states in other chromium-based materials. Remarkably, anomalous valley Hall effect with giant valley splitting is discovered in the magnetic states of these inversion-asymmetric systems without requiring spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Our findings open a new avenue towards exploring monolayer materials for valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Can An Uncertainty Relation Generate A Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental idea that there may be a role for the Casimir effect, via an uncertainty relation, in the generation of electron-positron and quark-gluon plasmas. We investigate this concept, reviewing the possible contribution of semi-classical electrodynamics to nuclear interactions, specifically focusing on the Casimir effect at sub-Fermi length scales. The main result is a temperature distance relation, derived from the time-energy uncertainty relation, which can have observable consequences at these extreme scales. From a more general perspective, since the energy-time uncertainty relation appears to be a significant physical quantity, we also provide a brief overview of recent developments in this direction in Sec. 3.2.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Properties and Topological Textures in PbTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ from a Second-Principles Open-Source interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an open-source, fully atomistic second-principles interatomic potential for lead titanate (PbTiO3), a benchmark ferroelectric material known for its strong polarization and high temperature phase transitions. While density functional theory excels at capturing atomic-scale behavior, it remains computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations required to explore complex phenomena. Our model addresses this limitation by accurately reproducing key properties of PbTiO3, including domain wall dynamics and skyrmion formation, which are known as key features to next-generation memory and energy-efficient technologies. Validated against DFT data, the model remains predictive across a wide range of conditions. It offers an accessible and efficient framework for high-accuracy large-scale simulations, allowing deeper insights into PbTiO3 and its potential applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Manipulation of Spatially Confined Multiferroic Heuslers by Martensitic Microstructure Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic shape-memory (MSM) Heuslers show a strong coupling between magnetic and structural characteristics, evidencing a correlation between magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties through a magnetostructural martensitic transformation. This functional aspect makes MSM Heuslers promising for integration into smart micro/nanodevices, including sensors, energy harvesters, and actuators. Controlling the martensitic microstructure, which determines the magnetic characteristics, is among the key points for optimization of the magnetic functional properties of these materials at different length scales. Here, we report a strategy for manipulating the magnetic properties of spatially confined epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films grown on Cr(001)//MgO(001) by twinning configuration engineering in the low-temperature ferromagnetic (martensitic) phase. We show how the twinning configurations in the continuous films and the micropatterned structures can be switched from Y-type (showing negligible magnetic stray field) into X-type (presenting significant magnetic stray field) by a post-annealing process. Advanced characterization techniques enable us to analyze the atomic structure and the surface quality of the annealed samples and to disentangle the twin-switching phenomenon. The martensitic microstructure engineering reported in this study introduces a simple method for promoting the magnetic stray-field contribution at the surface of Ni-Mn-Ga epitaxial thin films and micropatterns initially showing a negligible magnetic stray field.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface nesting driven anomalous Hall effect in magnetically frustrated Mn_2PdIn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear magnets with near-zero net magnetization and nontrivial bulk electronic topology hold significant promise for spintronic applications, though their scarcity necessitates purposeful design strategies. In this work, we report a topologically nontrivial electronic structure in metallic Mn_2PdIn, which crystallizes in the inverse Heusler structure and exhibits a spin-glassy ground state with quenched magnetization. The system features Weyl-type band crossings near the Fermi level and reveals a novel interplay among momentum-space nesting, orbital hybridization, and spin-orbit coupling. Comprehensive transport measurements uncover a pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Mn_2PdIn. The observed quadratic relationship between the longitudinal and anomalous Hall resistivities highlights the intrinsic Berry curvature contribution to AHE. These findings establish inverse Heusler alloys as compelling platforms for realizing noncollinear magnets that host Weyl-type semimetallic or metallic phases-combining suppressed magnetization with robust electronic transport-thereby offering a promising route toward their seamless integration into next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Global Stress Generation and Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator under Dynamic Loading for Two-Phase Random Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.</description>

      <title>Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the exciting properties of metamaterials and their innovative applications in non-Hermitian physics, with particular emphasis on the scattering formalism, a key topic of recent research. We have analyzed how light behaves in a negative index metamaterial (NIM), allowing us to develop a transfer matrix and identify the essential conditions for the occurrence of spectral singularities. These findings are crucial for fine-tuning system parameters that will drive the development of metamaterial slab lasers and coherent perfect absorber (CPA) systems. Overall, our research demonstrates the enormous potential of metamaterials and their significant role in driving innovation in various technology areas.</description>

      <title>Landau levels in Weyl semimetal under uniaxial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The external strain can lead to the similar effect to the external applied magnetic field. Such pseudomagnetic field can be larger than typical magnetic fields, what gives the opportunity to experimentally study the Landau levels. In this paper we study the effects of uniaxial strain on the Weyl nodes, using continuum and lattice model. In the continuum model we show that the uniaxial strain leads to magnetic field renormalization, which in practice corresponds to the shift of the Landau levels to higher energy. We also investigate type-I and type-II Weyl nodes using lattice model. In this case, the magnetic field is introduced by the Pierels substitution, while uniaxial strain by the direction dependence of hopping integrals. This allowed us to probe the Landau level and system spectrum which takes form of Hofstadter butterfly. We show that the renormalization of magnetic field, similar to this observed in the continuum model, emerges.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity: Bilayer-MnBi2Te4/Fe(Se,Te) Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi2Te4 coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi2Te4. This sliding mechanism breaks the MzT and PT symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin-polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A computational framework for predicting the effect of surface roughness in fatigue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface roughness is a critical factor influencing the fatigue life of structural components. Its effect is commonly quantified using a correction coefficient known as the surface factor. In this paper, a phase field based numerical framework is proposed to estimate the surface factor while accounting for the stochastic nature of surface roughness. The model is validated against existing experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of key parameters on the fatigue life of rough surfaces, such as surface topology and failure strength. An important effect of surface roughness is observed when the average surface roughness increases and the correlation length of the surface profile decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced with higher failure strengths.</description>

      <title>BOOM: Benchmarking Out-Of-distribution Molecular Property Predictions of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial Chern classes pose an obstruction to the existence of exponentially decaying Wannier functions which provide natural bases for spectral subspaces. For non-trivial Bloch bundles, we obtain decay rates of Wannier functions in dimensions $d=2,3$. For $d=2$, we construct Wannier functions with full asymptotics and optimal decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$ as conjectured by Thouless; for $d=3$, we construct Wannier functions with the uniform decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry Protected Transport at Correlated Oxide Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) protection is core to topological physics, yet its role in correlated oxides-typically non-topological-remains underexplored. This limit hampers the potential in engineering exotic quantum states by fusing TRS protection and the rich emergent phenomena in the oxide platform. Here, we report evidence of a TRS-protected subband at oxygen vacancy-free LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces. This subband causes a low-field quantum oscillation with anomalous characters: exceptionally light electron mass, aperiodicity, and susceptibility to magnetic fields. All findings align with a Rashba model in which TRS-protected transport occurs along quasi-1D ferroelastic domain walls, which possess a Dirac band topology and a giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling, two orders stronger than the 2D interface. Our results deepen the understanding of SrTiO3-based electron systems, unveiling an appealing new platform for quantum engineering.</description>

      <title>Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging due to their momentum mismatch with photons and energy mismatch with plasmons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that graphene's ability to sustain a high bias and support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population enables near-infrared SPP generation in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of undoped monolayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and silver (Ag). We show that this mechanism requires neither optical gratings nor electron tunneling to produce non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission, which is uniform along the Ag-hBN interface and achieves an internal conversion efficiency of up to $10^{-3}$ with the Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory calculations suggest a pronounced hole electron doping asymmetry in a single layer graphene. It turns out that a single graphene sheet can sustain doping levels up to 0.1 holes or up to a remarkably large 1.9 electrons per atom while maintaining dynamical [phonon] stability. Estimates of the superconducting critical temperature in the electron doped regime based on McMillans formula reveal two local maxima in the function of doping level which correlate with the local maxima of the electron phonon coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic structures on polycarbonate via UV femtosecond pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on bulk polycarbonate (PC) using 258 nm femtosecond laser pulses. A systematic approach was pursued to investigate the influence of various laser parameters such as fluence, effective number of pulses, energy dose and polarisation on the features of the generated LIPSS. Experimental results showed that linearly polarized beams produce LIPSS with period comparable to the laser wavelength. Moreover, it was observed that the orientation of LIPSS is either parallel or perpendicular to the laser polarization, depending on the excitation level. These features are similar to the LIPSS formed on dielectrics, despite the considerably higher absorption and larger extinction coefficient (~10-2) of polycarbonate at 258 nm. The orientation and features of the patterns at different excitation levels are explained using Sipe's theory, while the excitation and induced carrier densities were quantified through the application of a theoretical physical model that describes ultrafast dynamics in polymers. Furthermore, observations revealed that low excitation levels with linearly polarized enhance the uniformity of LIPSS, whereas irradiating PC targets with circularly polarized beams leads to the formation of microscale topographies decorated with protruding nanosphered-like structures, with their size varying based on the laser conditions. A detailed analysis of the impact of the induced topographies on their wetting and optical properties demonstrated a steady increase in hydrophilicity over time, in contrast to a modest increase in optical absorbance. The results regarding the morphological features and properties of the induced topographies on PC are anticipated to support future efforts in creating patterned surfaces on polymeric materials for potential applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Nodal and Nodeless Pairing Symmetry in Superconducting 6R-SnNbSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana fermions, a fundamental idea to fault-tolerant quantum computing, can emerge in systems where superconductivity coexists with nontrivial band topology. One promising route to realizing such topological superconductors (TSCs) involves inducing superconductivity in topological materials, particularly in systems lacking inversion symmetry. In this study, we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of Sn-intercalated NbSe2, forming a new polytype, 6R-SnNbSe2. This compound crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group R3m and exhibits bulk superconductivity below Tc around 4 K. Structural, electronic, and magnetic measurements confirm the emergence of a superconducting phase derived from Sn intercalation into the non-superconducting 3R-NbSe2. Temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth and superfluid density measurements down to 1.5 K are performed using the tunnel diode oscillator technique. The findings suggest the mixing of nodal and nodeless superconductivity in 6R-SnNbSe2. Given the non-centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure and the theoretical prediction of topological nodal-line features in SnNbSe2, it is an interesting candidate to investigate unconventional pairing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the potential of this material to host nontrivial superconducting states among the transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The introduced methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. SPiFOL, as a physics-informed operator learning method, enables rapid predictions through forward inference after training. To ensure accuracy, we incorporate physical constraints and diversify the training data. However, performance may still degrade for out-of-distribution microstructures. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. The framework shows great potential for efficient and scalable prediction of mechanical responses in complex material systems while also reducing the training time required for training physics-informed neural operators.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Workflow for Transmission Electron Microscopy: From Data Analysis Automation to Materials Knowledge Unveiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) has significantly advanced materials science but faces challenges in correlating precise atomic structure information with the functional properties of devices due to its time-intensive nature. To address this, we introduce an analytical workflow for the holistic characterization, modelling, and simulation of device heterostructures. This workflow automates the experimental (S)TEM data analysis, providing an in-depth characterization of crystallographic information, 3D orientation, elemental composition, and strain distribution. It reduces a process that typically takes days for a trained human into an automatic routine solved in minutes. Utilizing a physics-guided artificial intelligence model, it generates representative descriptions of materials and samples. The workflow culminates in creating digital twins, 3D finite element and atomic models of millions of atoms, enabling simulations that provide crucial insights into device behaviour in practical applications. Demonstrated with SiGe planar heterostructures for scalable spin qubits, the workflow links digital twins to theoretical properties, revealing how atomic structure impacts materials and functional properties such as spatially-resolved phononic or electronic characteristics, or (inverse) spin orbit lengths. The versatility of our workflow is demonstrated through its application to a wide array of materials systems, device configurations, and sample morphologies.</description>

Abstract: We explore elemental Si, Ge and Sn free-standing slabs in diamond, clathrate and other competing structures and evaluate their stability by comparing Kohn-Sham total energies at the same atoms/area coverage $\rho$. We find that within 3-6 ML range (in units of diamond monolayer), the surface energy stabilizes clathrates against the bulk-stable diamond structure or other competitors, for all three elements. At~1.3-1.6 ML coverages, Si and Ge stable layers are adatomic decorations of the puckered honeycomb lattice, forming a dumbbell--decorated pattern with rectangular unit cell. Analogical Sn layer is unstable to a web-like net of interconnected Sn$_9$ clusters. The zoo of stable thin-layer non-diamond structures is completed by a Sn metallic bilayer at 2.3 ML coverage.</description>

Abstract: Broken inversion symmetry of magnetic lattice is normally described by Lifshitz invariants in micromagnetic energy functional. Three exceptions are the lattices with T$_\textrm{d}$, C$_\textrm{3h}$ and D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetries. The inversion symmetry breaking of the corresponding magnets is described by more complex 4-spin chiral invariants that cannot be related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Experimental detection of 4-spin chiral interactions is an important task that has yet to be performed. We propose that the 4-spin chiral interaction can be probed by energy selective magnon relaxation in two-dimensional ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ that possess D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an environmentally friendly and scalable method to create fluorine-doped diamond-like carbon (F-DLC) coatings using plasma immersion ion implantation plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PIII-PECVD) with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. F-DLC films tend to have low wettability and good mechanical flexibility, which make them suitable for applications in biomedical devices and antibiofouling surfaces. We report on the effects of fluorine incorporation on the surface chemistry, surface energy, and morphology of these coatings, showing that our method is effective in increasing the fluorine content in the F-DLC up to 40%. We show that the addition of fluorine leads to a decrease in surface energy, which is consistent with a reduction in surface wettability.</description>

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</description>

      <title>X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [D\"{o}ppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 \AA$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectricity with metastable ferroelectric state from Kittel model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have revisited the Kittel model that describes antiferroelectricity (AFE) in terms of two sublattices of spontaneous polarization and antiparallel couplings. By constructing the comprehensive phase diagram including the antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric phases in the parameter space, we identified a phase with antiferroelectric stable states and ferroelectric metastable states (ASFM) due to the w2Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USAeak coupling between sublattices. We found that the metastability of the ferroelectric phase leads to apparent remanent polarization, depending on the measurement timescale. This explains the observed ferroelectric behavior of orthorhombic hafnia, which is predicted to be an antiferroelctric materials.</description>

Abstract: We show by acoustic emission analysis that FeAlCrMo complex-concentrated alloy (CCA) exhibits signatures of self-organization of deformation processes during both microplasticity and serrated flow (dynamic strain aging). Due to complex microstructures of CCAs and scarcity of literature data, these novel alloys are a prominent subject of future research efforts.</description>

      <title>A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of Metal-Ligand Redox in Li-ion Battery Cathodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing Li-ion battery cathodes in terms of distinct transition metal or oxygen redox regimes can lead to confusion in understanding metal-ligand hybridisation, oxygen dimerisation, and degradation. There is a pressing need to study the electronic structure of these materials and determine the role each cation and anion plays in charge compensation. Here, we employ transition metal Ledge X-ray Resonance Photoemission Spectroscopy in conjunction with Single Impurity Anderson simulations to directly evaluate the redox mechanisms in (de-)lithiated battery electrodes. This approach reconciles the redox description of two canonical cathodes -- LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$ and LiNiO$_{2}$ -- in terms of varying degrees of charge transfer using the established Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework, common to condensed matter physics. In LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$, we show that capacity arises due to the depopulation of metal 3d states. Whereas, in LiNiO$_{2}$, charge transfer dominates and redox occurs through the formation and elimination of ligand hole states. This work clarifies the role of oxygen in Ni-rich system and provides a framework to explain how capacity can be extracted from oxygen-dominated states in highly covalent systems without needing to invoke dimerisation.</description>

      <title>Large circular photogalvanic effect in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi with simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries has opened up new avenues for research into the interaction between light and topologically protected bands. In this work, we present a comprehensive examination of the shift current and injection current responsible for the circular photogalvanic effect in CeAlSi using first-principles calculations. Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$ axis of the crystal: a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene consecutively twisted at 1.49{\deg} and 1.68{\deg}. We demonstrate the atomic reconstruction between the two competing moir\'e superlattices strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moir\'e band insulator state, characterized by measured strong nonlocal valley Hall effect that sensitively depends on the inter-moir\'e competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-plane carrier distribution. Our study sheds light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted multilayer systems, by systematically investigating transport signatures of moir\'e Berry curvature and its enhancement from moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice reconstruction. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach toward engineering the band structure and its topology for a quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene</title>

Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>First-principles derived force field for h-BN monolayer nanostructures: Applications to sheets, nanotubes and nanotori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. By combining a continuum model for bent hollow beams with the definition of bending rigidity, we validate the model predictions against an analytical expression for the bending rigidity of large-diameter hBN nanotubes, expressed as a function of their radius and the in-plane Young modulus.</description>

      <title>Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable polarized state of a two-level atomic system with a right-circularly polarized electric dipole transition in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</description>

      <title>Surface-Dominated Quantum Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport in the Layered Antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet CrSBr has recently garnered significant attention due to its air stability, high magnetic transition temperature, and semiconducting properties. We investigate its nonlinear transport properties and identify a quantum metric dipole-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear longitudinal resistivity, which switch sign upon reversing the N\'eel vector. The significant quantum metric dipole originates from Dirac nodal lines near the conduction band edge within the experimentally achievable doping range. Known the weak interlayer coupling, it is unexpected that the nonlinear conductivities do not scale with sample thickness but are dominantly contributed by surface layers. In the electron-doped region, the top layer dominates the response while the top three layers contribute the most in the hole-doped region. Our results establish topological nodal lines as a guiding principle to design high-performance nonlinear quantum materials and suggest that surface-sensitive transport devices will provide new avenues for nonlinear electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Heat Transfer at Silica-Water Interfaces via Hydroxyl and Methyl Surface Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in modern technological applications. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.</description>
