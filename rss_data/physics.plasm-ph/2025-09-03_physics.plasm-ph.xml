      <title>Collision operator for electron runaway in cold weakly-ionized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cold weakly-ionized plasmas, Dreicer generation mechanism can be non-diffusive as demonstrated in [Y. Lee et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 17 175102 (2024)]. By expanding the previous letter, we present the detailed description of a proper collision operator to precisely account for the non-diffusive electron kinetics. The operator appropriately combines the Fokker-Planck operator and Boltzmann operator where free-bound collision cross sections are valid in low energy region. The proposed operator is envisaged to predict runaway electrons generations in cold weakly-ionized plasmas, particularly to design a runaway-free reactor tokamak startup.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent generation of the ambipolar electric field in collisionless plasmas via multi-mode electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation of the ambipolar electric field in a gravitationally stratified, collisionless plasma atmosphere. In such environments, gravity tends to separate charged species. To prevent separation an electric field, classically described by the Pannekoek-Rosseland expression, is usually imposed externally. Here, we propose a self-consistent method to recover this field based on a multi-mode Fourier expansion of the electrostatic interaction. We show that, under suitable conditions, this approach naturally leads to the ambipolar electric field and restores charge neutrality. The method is tested in both isothermal and multi-temperature plasma configurations. This framework provides a foundation for future developments that may include collisions, ionization, and asymmetric boundary conditions to model more realistic stellar atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Extended temporal coarse-graining in a stratified and confined plasma under thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended investigation of a recently introduced model of gravitationally confined, collisionless plasma (Barbieri et al. 2024a), which showed that rapid temperature fluctuations at the base of the plasma, occurring on timescales much shorter than the electron crossing time, can drive the system into a non-thermal state characterized by anti-correlated temperature and density profiles, commonly referred to as temperature inversion. To describe this phenomenon, a temporal coarse-graining formalism was developed (Barbieri et al. 2024b). In this work, we generalize that approach to cover regimes where the timescales of temperature fluctuations are comparable to or exceed the electron crossing time. We derive a set of kinetic equations that incorporate an additional term arising from the coarse-graining procedure, which was not present in the earlier formulation. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the plasma dynamics under these broader conditions, showing that the electric field influences the system when fluctuation timescales approach the electron crossing time. However, for timescales much larger than the proton crossing time, the electric field becomes negligible. The observed behaviours are interpreted within the framework of the extended temporal coarse-graining theory, and we identify the regimes and conditions in which temperature inversion persists.</description>

      <title>Plasma lens for the focusing of positron bunches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of effective focusing schemes for positron bunches in plasma accelerators remains a significant challenge, as nonlinear regimes fail to create stable focusing channels for positrons. This work presents a method for focusing and improving the quality of positron bunches using a plasma lens operating in the linear regime. Through numerical simulations, we investigate two distinct focused positron bunch profiles: a purely Gaussian bunch and an elongated, flat-top bunch with Gaussian rising and falling edges. For both configurations, the results demonstrate the capability to achieve high-quality transverse focusing. Furthermore, beyond focusing, the proposed system enables potential possibility to reduce energy spread of positron bunches of the sequence after precursor.</description>

      <title>The properties of resistive MHD modes and unstable spectra in advanced tokamak regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced tokamak regimes, featuring extended regions of low magnetic shear, are promising candidates for future fusion reactors but are also more prone to specific kinds of MHD instabilities. The proximity to a rational surface in a very low shear region weakens field line bending stabilisation and amplifies the effects of toroidal coupling between modes, leading to the emergence of long-wavelength resistive infernal modes. These modes can grow collectively as a discrete spectrum, leading to a cascade of different perturbations for single mode numbers $(m, n)$, with subdominant modes showing increasingly oscillatory radial structures. These spectra of fast-growing modes are significant for developing stable scenarios in future reactors, and for the understanding of global reconnection events like sawteeth, motivating a deeper investigation into their fundamental physics. Deriving new analytic solutions, including a generalisation of the ideal interchange dispersion relation to non monotonic $q$ profiles, and extending a modular linear resistive MHD solver, we investigate how resistivity, compressibility, toroidal effects, and shaping influence stability, especially in reversed shear $q$ profiles. It is also shown that common assumptions in numerical calculations prevent the observation of the full variety of modes present in these advanced scenarios.</description>

      <title>Measured Properties of an Antihydrogen Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a factor of $100$ increase in the antihydrogen beam intensity downstream of ASACUSA's Cusp trap: $320$ atoms detected per $15$-minute run. The beam contains many Rydberg atoms, which we selectively ionize to determine their velocity and binding energy. The time of flight signal is modeled using a $1\mathrm{D}$ Maxwellian velocity distribution with a temperature of $1500\,\mathrm{K}$, which is close to the measured antiproton plasma temperature. A numerical simulation reproduces the observed distribution of binding energies and suggests that about $16\%$ of the atoms may be in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Solar Vortices as Conduits for Magnetoacoustic Waves: Multi-Layer Coupling and Their Role in Atmospheric Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun's atmosphere hosts swirling plasma structures, known as solar vortices, which have long been thought to channel wave energy into higher layers. Until now, no direct observations have confirmed their role in the heating of the atmosphere. Here, we present the first direct evidence that solar vortices act as structured waveguides, carrying magnetoacoustic modes (waves that behave like sound waves but travel through magnetized plasma) that leave clear wave-heating signatures. By mapping vortex regions at multiple heights and analysing the waves they contain, we show that magnetoacoustic waves efficiently transfer energy, offset losses from radiation, and dominate energy transport in the lower chromosphere. These results challenge the long-standing assumption that vortices primarily support twisting disturbances traveling along magnetic field lines (Alfven waves), revealing instead that magnetoacoustic modes play the leading role in the lower atmosphere. This redefines the role of vortices in magnetized plasmas and has broader implications for wave-plasma interactions in regions of strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Wakefield acceleration of self-injected bunch in a conical plasma channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration is a widely studied method for accelerating charged particle bunches, with selfinjection being a key feature. However, as the bunch accelerates beyond the driver velocity, it shifts out of the maximal accelerating wakefield phase. This work proposes using a tapering cone channel to address this issue. The gradual narrowing synchronizes the bunch with the wake phase by reducing the bubble size, keeping the bunch in the accelerating phase. The obtained dependencies of the bunch length, field Ez, and mean longitudinal momentum pz on the channel radius are useful for further researches.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation in the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota &amp; Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.</description>

      <title>Turbulent heating in collisionless low-beta plasmas: imbalance, Landau damping, and electron-ion energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.</description>

      <title>Vibrational-Electron Heating in Plasma Flows: A Thermodynamically Consistent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) in non-equilibrium {plasma} flows is critical, yet hampered by inadequate models for electron heating from vibrationally excited states. Prior models often relied on ad-hoc scaling or flawed applications of detailed balance that failed to ensure the convergence of electron temperature and species-specific vibrational temperature ($T_{\rm v}$) at thermal equilibrium. This paper introduces a novel, thermodynamically consistent electron heating model derived rigorously from the principle of detailed balance. By assuming a Boltzmann vibrational distribution and employing an effective activation energy, our approach yields a simple heating-to-cooling ratio of $\exp(\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$, where $\theta_{\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature of the species under consideration. This formulation guarantees that $T_{\rm e}$ correctly converges to $T_{\rm v}$ at equilibrium. A key advantage is that our model can utilize total cooling rates determined from swarm experiments, leading to higher accuracy at low electron temperatures. For re-entry flows, the proposed approach predicts an electron temperature several times lower than previous models which results in improved agreement with some flight test data. These more reliable predictions can significantly enhance the modeling fidelity of plasma-assisted combustion, laser-induced plasmas, and various hypersonic plasma technologies such as electron transpiration cooling or magnetohydrodynamic force generators.</description>

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>
