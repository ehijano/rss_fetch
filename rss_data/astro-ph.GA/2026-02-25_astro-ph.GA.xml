      <title>ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) II: 3mm continuum images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey, ACES, has mapped $\gtrsim1000$ square arcminutes at 3 mm toward the center of our Galaxy. ACES provides the first large-scale, high-resolution ($\sim2.5$") view of the central $\sim200$ parsecs of the Milky Way. In this work, we describe the continuum data processing and present the continuum data products. In the combined mosaic of 45 individual ALMA mosaics, the typical RMS noise achieved is $\sim0.1$ mJy per $\sim2.5$" beam, though there is a tail of substantially higher noise toward regions with bright continuum structure, especially around Sgr A* and Sgr B2. In-band spectral indices are measurable for a small fraction of the brightest and most compact sources, enabling distinction between dust-dominated and free-free- or synchrotron-dominated sources. To recover emission on large angular scales, we present the GBT MUSTANG-2 Three millimeter Extended Nucleus Survey (TENS), a new 10"resolution survey of the CMZ, which we combine with the ACES image by feathering. To demonstrate the quality and reliability of the ACES data, we compare to previously-published ALMA data obtained with higher resolution and sensitivity, finding overall good agreement with past results, but some disagreement toward the brightest sources.</description>

      <title>The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Chemical Abundance Comparison Between the ISM and CGM of Main-Sequence Galaxies at z=4-6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaseous halos around galaxies play an important role in galaxy evolution. The exchange of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are caused by the formation, feedback, and/or merging history of galaxies. We study the variation in chemical composition between the ISM ($\lesssim3\,$kpc) and CGM ($\sim5-10\,$kpc) for a sample of $M_{\star}&gt;10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$ main-sequence galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;6$ with both JWST and ALMA observations. Using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy, we derive the optical line ratios from the ISM and the CGM for our sample focusing on the typical optical lines used for metallicity studies. Our comparison shows that the ISM and the CGM have similar chemical abundances. This indicates that the CGM of these typical $4&lt;z&lt;6$ galaxies is enriched to the level of their ISM in the early universe. Using statistical tests, we find that some of the line ratios show marginal differences between the ISM and CGM. Combined with \texttt{Cloudy} modeling, our results suggest that a difference in ionization level (higher for the ISM) is the dominant reason for the observed ratio difference of oxygen line ratios. There is also indication of a deficit in the nitrogen abundance with respect to oxygen in the CGM, which suggests a delay in redistribution of secondary nitrogen. Finally, an enhanced $F_{[\rm CII]\rm 158\mu m}/F_{\rm H\alpha}$ ratio is observed in the CGM, suggesting that feedback and/or mergers play a key role in metal mixing.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction on binary stars in dark matter dominated environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study binary stars moving through a uniform dark matter background and experiencing dynamical friction. The centre-of-mass motion of the pairs is taken into account. We derive formulas and timescales for the secular evolution of the orbital parameters for both wide and close binaries. We apply these results to environments typical of dark matter dominated ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and show that some binaries undergo significant eccentricity oscillations, while their semi-major axes decrease more gradually. We consider a simple binary star population and find that dynamical friction, notably, can enhance the bias from unresolved binaries in velocity dispersion measurements. With future, more detailed theoretical studies and improving observational capabilities, binary stars may serve as a tool to probe the dark matter content of some of the faintest galaxies.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots: One Photometric Tag Concealing Diverse Spectroscopic Flavors of Massive Star Formation and Black Hole Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compile JWST/NIRSpec prism and MIRI data for 249 Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $2.3&lt;z&lt;9.3$, forming a representative spectroscopic subset of NIRCam-selected LRDs. We derive a median stacked spectrum covering rest-frame 0.09-1.2 $\mu$m, with MIRI photometry extending the spectral energy distribution to 4 $\mu$m. Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties. Assuming LRDs host super-massive black holes (BHs) surrounded by dense gas clouds, and stars accompany this core, we infer masses of $M_{BH}\sim10^{6.0-6.5}$~M$_\odot$ and $M_\bigstar\sim10^{8.3}$ M$_\odot$, corresponding to BH-to-stellar mass ratios of 1-2%. The stacks show ubiquitous UV and optical FeII emission, indicating a direct view of the broad-line region and high (but sub-Eddington) accretion ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.6\pm0.2$). We find a significant stellar contribution in the far-UV, reaching $\sim80$% in the bluest systems. Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$\lambda$4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event. We also detect strong Balmer breaks and atypical Balmer, Paschen, [OIII], and optical and near-infrared HeI line ratios, and an absorption at $\sim4550$ Angstrom (probably linked to FeII), all consistent with radiative-transfer effects in high-density gas with warm temperatures (4000-7000 K). We find a diversity of LRD flavors modulated by the luminosity ratio between between a short ($\lesssim20$ Myr) and intense phase of BH activity, the most extreme stage lasting $\sim3-7$ Myr, characterized by near-Eddington-limit radiation, and a nuclear and compact starburst dominated by massive stars (even super-massive, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{SMS}\sim10^{5}$ M$_\odot$), all embedded in dense gas with modest dust content producing a variety of optical depths.</description>

      <title>The First Systematic Survey of Stellar Halos in High-Inclination Galaxies Reveals Unusually Quiescent Merger Histories of Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar halos are the only major stellar component of disk galaxies that lack systematic observational characterization, yet they encode critical information about galaxy merger histories. We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 &lt;= log Mstar/Msun &lt;= 11.0 and redshift z &lt; 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun &gt; 9.9 and &gt;= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z &lt;= 0.07.</description>

      <title>ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) VI: ALMA Large Program Reveals a Highly Filamentary Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is the way station that primarily controls how much gas flows from the disk of the Galaxy towards the central nucleus. While this region is well documented to have extreme gas properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the Galaxy, the properties of the bulk molecular gas at high angular resolution are relatively unexplored. Band 3 data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) large program ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) reveal the highly filamentary nature of CMZ molecular gas at high resolution (3" or 0.1pc) across the entire CMZ. Visual inspection of these data suggests that there are at least two general classes of elongated structures, which we identify as: i) large-scale (10 pc) filamentary structures (LFs) and ii) a ubiquitous population of small-scale (about 1 pc) filamentary structures (SFs). We present detailed morphological and kinematic properties towards three structures in each category, as well as their association with magnetic fields and the correlation of HNCO 4(0,4)-3(0,3) with other molecular species. Our investigation reveals that these structures are largely coherent in position-position-velocity space. The alignment with the magnetic field structure is mixed, with some parallel, some perpendicular, and some intermediate alignments. We find that LFs likely trace pieces of contiguous CMZ orbital structures and are a manifestation of global CMZ dynamics. The second class, SFs, are pervasive and may be the result of complicated turbulence and shearing dynamics in the CMZ gas flows, as seen in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Willman 1 Revisited: The Kinematics, Chemistry, and Orbital Properties of a Potentially-Disrupting Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-faint Milky Way satellite Willman 1 (W1; $M_V = -2.6$; $r_{\rm half} \sim27$ pc) was the first stellar over-density found via resolved stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yet its classification as either a dwarf galaxy or star cluster remains ambiguous. Using new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, HST/ACS photometry, and orbital modeling, we re-examine the nature of W1. From our updated sample of 57 member stars, we find that past analyses included four binaries and seven non-members, identified here using Gaia proper motions and updated velocities. We continue to find a velocity dispersion consistent with previous analyses, measuring $\sigma_v = 4.7^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ from 49 stars out to $3~r_{\rm half}$. If W1 is in equilibrium, this suggests a dynamical mass of $5.9^{+3.7}_{-3.4} \times 10^5~M_{\odot}$ and a mass-to-light ratio of $(M/L)_V = 660 \pm 590$. Based on Ca II triplet measurements, we estimate an iron abundance of [Fe/H] $= -2.45^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and a metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.30^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ dex. We confirm that W1 does not exhibit mass segregation inside $\sim1~r_{\rm half}$. Our best-fit orbital model predicts that W1 is at apocenter, implying that W1 has been closer to the Milky Way in the recent past, reaching a pericentric distance $\lesssim 25$ kpc from the Galactic center $\sim0.3$ Gyr ago. Given its internal kinematics, metallicity spread, and lack of mass segregation, we conclude that W1 is a galaxy. However, given its orbit and structural properties, which suggest that W1 might be tidally disrupted, and the difficulty of identifying a pure member sample, we caution that the measured internal velocity dispersion may not accurately reflect the dynamical mass of this system.</description>

      <title>ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) III: Molecular line data reduction and HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) large program has observed the inner ~ 200 pc of the Milky Way at 3 mm (Band 3) using ALMA's 12m, 7m, and Total Power arrays. With an angular resolution of ~ 2", ACES provides a contiguous, multi-scale view of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) via the dust continuum and a suite of molecular lines. We present an overview of the molecular line data processing for ACES and describe the first data release. We showcase the HNCO (4-3) and HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) data, which were targeted at high spectral resolution (0.2 km s$^{-1}$) to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the CMZ. The HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ maps are compared with previous single-dish CMZ surveys and discrete ALMA observations of CMZ clouds to demonstrate the quality of the data. We highlight the ubiquity of parsec-scale, linear absorption features traced by HCO$^{+}$. Their origin is unknown, and ACES provides the first opportunity to study these enigmatic features throughout the CMZ. We release the HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ cubes for all 45 ACES fields, along with the full cube mosaics which combine all fields into a contiguous mosaic of the CMZ. We additionally provide advanced products of these full mosaics, including integrated and peak intensity, noise, and position-velocity maps. These products provide substantial legacy value for the community, offering an unparalleled view of the physical and kinematic structure of the dense gas in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>BASS LVI. Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Quasars behind the disk of M31 galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to increase the limited number of quasars behind M31, necessary for probing the chemical content of the gas and for proper motion reference, with reliable and homogeneous redshift measurements from emission lines. We carried out spectroscopic follow up of 32 quasar candidates. We confirm 23 quasars: two are new discoveries (J004029.727+403705.68 and J004215.489+412031.52) and the rest were reported elsewhere, but with somewhat deficient analysis; 16 spectra are published for the first time. We report new homogeneous redshifts for 34 quasars (from 40 spectra, adding 17 from archives) and summarize all available information about bona-fide quasars with reliable redshift, bringing their number to 124 within the mu_B=26 mag/arcsec^2 isophote. We carried out a comparison of redshifts from different sources and excluded some objects with redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra. We derive the reddening for them from the color excess with respect to dereddened counterparts with similar redshifts in the field. Comparisons of our reddenings with M31 reddening maps found no significant correlations. Most QSOs behind M31 show low reddening and do not probe high-extinctions underlining the need to identify fainter quasars behind nearby galaxies, especially behind higher extinction regions -- probably due to a bias towards following up brighter and less extinct candidates. Finally, the redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra must be treated with caution, because they can contain significant errors.</description>

      <title>ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) I: Overview</title>

Abstract: The mass flows and energy cycles within the inner regions of galaxies exert a powerful influence on the evolution of the galaxy population. The centre of the Milky Way is the only galactic nucleus for which it is possible to resolve the physical mechanisms that drive these cycles, namely star formation and feedback, while also tracing global (&gt;100 pc) processes which determine where and when star formation and feedback occur. We present an overview of ACES, the 'Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CMZ Exploration Survey', a ~1.5" angular resolution, 0.2-3 km/s spectral resolution ALMA Band 3 (85-102 GHz), survey of the 'Central Molecular Zone' (CMZ) -- the inner-100 pc of the Galaxy (l = 359.4 deg to 0.8 deg). ACES spectral setup is tuned to observe optimal tracers of the physical, chemical, and kinematic conditions in over 70 spectral features (e.g. HCO+, HNCO, SiO, H40alpha, complex molecules) of the gas in the CMZ, to derive the properties of all potentially star-forming Galactic Centre gas, from global scales (100 pc) to dense ~0.05 pc structures that are expected to host individual star-forming cores, down to sub-sonic (&lt;0.4 km/s) velocity resolution. In this overview paper, we provide the scientific justification for the ACES survey, explain the choice of observational setup, and describe the data legacy products. Finally, we show some of the initial ACES data which highlight the power of ACES' combination of high angular resolution, unprecedented spatial dynamic range, sensitivity, spectral resolution and spectral bandwidth as an illustration of how ACES aims to understand how global processes set the location, intensity, and timescales for star formation and feedback in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>An automated activity classification tool for optical galaxy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable, versatile galaxy activity diagnostics are essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods frequently necessitate extensive preprocessing, such as starlight subtraction and emission line deblending (e.g., H{\alpha} and [N II]), which can introduce substantial biases and uncertainties due to their model-dependent nature. In this work we developed an automated, diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between star-forming (SF), active galactic nuclei (AGN), low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), composite, and passive galaxies. We developed a diagnostic tool based on a support vector machine trained on data from optical emission-line ratios and color selection criteria. From literature studies and exploring combinations of discriminatory feature schemes, we found that the equivalent widths of H{\beta}, [O III]{\lambda}5007, and H{\alpha}+[N II]{\lambda}6548,84 as key diagnostic features. Additionally, galaxies classified as AGN can be distinguished into broad- and narrow-line AGN by measuring the full quarter at the half-maximum of H{\alpha} and [N II] complex. We have developed a diagnostic tool that encompasses all activities of galaxies while achieving high performance scores across all of them. Our diagnostic achieves overall accuracy of 83% and recall of 79% for SF, 94% for AGN, 85% for LINER, 77% for composite, and 96% for passive galaxies. Our diagnostic tool significantly improves upon existing diagnostics as it eliminates the need for preprocessing (i.e., starlight subtraction or flux calibration) and spectral line fitting, includes all activity classes under one scheme, and distinguishes the two main AGN types. In addition, omitting starlight subtraction does not significantly reduce performance. Furthermore, Its narrow wavelength requirement enables use across a wide redshift range, making it ideal for high-z studies.</description>

      <title>First Observation of CO$_2$ Emission and foreground absorption Toward the Galactic Center with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO$_2$ is an important, stable, and abundant molecule in the Universe, but it is very difficult to detect because it has no observable pure rotational transitions. The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO$_2$ is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H$_2$O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO$_2$ absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO$_2$ gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50~K, a column density around 2$\times$10$^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 $\mu$m, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO$_2$, and 2) CO$_2$ ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4~kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO$_2$ emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS~11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central topic in extragalactic astronomy is understanding the formation and evolutionary histories of galaxies. These systems often comprise multiple structural components with distinct physical and dynamical properties, making it challenging to disentangle their individual contributions. Aiming at investigating the true structure of the inner stellar disk, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline for the chronochemical and dynamical analysis of galaxies (Glance: Galactic archaeoLogy via chronochemicAl &amp; dyNamiCal modElling). The presented pipeline employs several state-of-the-art techniques by integrating them into a single, automated pipeline, enabling streamlined analysis of integral-field spectroscopy data, by allowing users to easily and directly extract valuable information on stellar populations, kinematics, dynamics, and gas properties. It automates multiple analysis techniques, including stellar population synthesis (Fado, Starlight, post-processing with RemoveYoung, kinematic extraction (pPXF, Bayes-LOSVD), and dynamical modelling (Dynamite). It handles tasks such as Galactic extinction correction, de-redshifting, Voronoi binning, and nebular continuum correction, while offering extensive customization options. Parallel processing significantly reduces computational time. When applied to MUSE data sampling the central region of NGC 1566, this methodology reveals that its stellar disk significantly deviates from the conventional exponential model, challenging the assumption of universality in disk morphology. In summary, this work presents a powerful, publicly available pipeline for conducting galactic archaeology, designed to advance our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved interstellar dust properties in the face-on spiral galaxy M 99 as observed by NIKA2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large dust grains in thermal equilibrium dominate the far-infrared and contribute to the millimetre continuum of star-forming galaxies, but constraining their properties is difficult due to free-free and synchrotron contamination. We study spatial variations in the dust spectral index, mass, and grain properties in the nearby face-on spiral galaxy M 99. We use new 1.15 and 2 mm continuum observations from NIKA2 on the IRAM 30 m telescope (IMEGIN Guaranteed Time Large Programme) combined with multiwavelength data from UV to radio. The infrared-to-radio SED is decomposed into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE. Dust is modelled via a modified blackbody (MBB) with variable millimetre spectral index beta and the THEMIS dust model with fixed beta. We perform spatially-resolved analysis at scales ~1.75 kpc (~25''), covering the centre, spiral arms, and inter-arm regions. MBB fits reveal beta variations from ~1.6-1.7 in diffuse regions to ~2.3-2.5 in dense star-forming areas, likely due to grain coagulation and changes in silicate-to-carbonaceous ratios. Dust masses from variable beta are up to ~4x higher than fixed-beta models, which systematically bias dust-to-stellar and dust-to-gas ratios. The small grain fraction rises from ~10% in the centre to ~15% in the diffuse disc, anti-correlated with the interstellar radiation field; gas-phase metallicity plays a minor role within 8 kpc. Synchrotron spectral index ranges from ~0.6-0.7 in star-forming regions to ~1.2 in the diffuse medium, consistent with cosmic-ray electron ageing.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Sub-Galactic Relationship Between Star Formation and the Hot Interstellar Medium in NGC 4254</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between star formation and X-ray emission from the hot interstellar medium (ISM) on $\sim$kpc scales in NGC 4254 (M99) by combining spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) and Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting. We measure sub-galactic star formation rates (SFR) by modeling spectrophotometric UV-IR data with flexible SFHs, and we produce point-source-subtracted maps of the diffuse X-ray emission using Chandra data. We extract and fit the spectra of 5 regions selected by their SFR density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, deriving hot gas luminosities and plasma temperatures. We examine the sub-galactic $kT-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and $L^{\rm gas}_X-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ scaling relations in NGC 4254, and compare to predictions from simple models of the feedback into the ISM from core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The hot gas emission from NGC 4254 is consistent with thermalization of $\approx 40-50\%$ of the energy from CCSNe in the ISM, and mass-loading of the CCSNe ejecta which decreases as $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{-1/3}$. Our optimized model implies a temperature and X-ray production efficiency that scale as $kT = (0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.18}~{\rm keV}) \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34\pm0.10}$ and $\eta = (0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}) \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34\pm0.18}$, respectively, for $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} = 0.01-0.13~{\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. We also compare the properties of the hot ISM to other ISM phases using data from the PHANGS program. The diffuse X-ray emission of a given region is on average 200 times fainter than the H$\alpha$ emission, and we see evidence that the hot ISM is over-pressurized compared to the large-scale dynamical equilibrium pressure of the galaxy, consistent with expansion of the hot ISM into the ambient medium.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Selection of High-Redshift Emission-Line Galaxies for future DESI-like surveys with Deep Multi-band Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission-line galaxies (ELGs) are an important tracer of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and large-scale structure (LSS) at $z &gt; 1$. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using deep wide-area multi-band imaging (e.g., from the Rubin Observatory) to efficiently select high redshift ELGs. Using Hyper Supreme-Cam $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 many-band photometric redshifts, we designed simple color cuts guided by a probabilistic random forest classifier to select galaxies at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$. We then empirically tested and refined these color cuts using two samples of galaxies with deep spectroscopy and broad color coverage obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Compared to DESI ELGs at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$, we achieve a higher redshift measurement success rate (89% versus 69%), a much higher correct redshift range success rate (84% versus 34%), and a far higher net surface density yield (1372 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$ versus 660 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$). Combining our sample with current DESI ELGs would increase the net ELG number density by a factor of $\sim3$, moving it out of the shot-noise limited regime and reducing the uncertainties on the BAO scale parameter at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$ by a factor of $\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Observations of Quasars with Velocity-Offset Broad Lines: Assessing the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the final stages of a galaxy merger, dynamical friction acting on the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the post-merger remnant can lead to the formation of a gravitationally bound binary SMBH. In the event that at least one of these SMBHs is actively accreting, the system can appear phenomenologically as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a broad line region (BLR) kinematically offset from the host galaxy rest frame. Such velocity offsets have been interpreted as signatures of binary SMBHs, recoiling SMBHs, or BLR gas dynamics within a single-SMBH system. We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of five nearby (0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2) Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars whose broad emission lines are Doppler-shifted relative to their host galaxies' systemic velocities, along with archival Chandra observations of 11 additional sources from the same sample. Using our Chandra data, we constrain SMBH masses with multiple independent techniques. We find systematic, method-dependent differences among black hole mass estimates, with masses inferred from the fundamental plane of black hole activity generally lower and single-epoch virial masses typically higher than those obtained using other methods. We also compare the X-ray photon indices and optical-to-X-ray spectral indices of our quasars to the broader quasar population. While we find no strong differences in optical-to-X-ray spectral indices, we do find systematically harder X-ray photon indices than typically observed in comparable quasars. These results constrain competing physical models but do not provide conclusive evidence for or against a binary SMBH origin of the velocity-offset BLRs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We release the intermediate-width spectral window data from the ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) Large Program, which covers SiO(2-1), SO(2_2-1_1), H13CO+(1-0), H13CN(1-0), HN13C(1-0), and HC15N (1-0), among other molecular line transitions, with an angular resolution of ~2 arcsec and a velocity resolution of 1.7 km s-1 . The full cubes of the two spectral windows as well as the key data products will be available to the community. We also present the integrated brightness, peak brightness, centroid velocity, and Galactic longitude-velocity maps of the six lines. We briefly discuss morphological correlations between the continuum and the molecular line emission, and brightness ratios between pairs of isotopologue or isotopomer lines.

      <title>Detectability of Satellite Planes in Mock Observations of Isolated L* Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence and prevalence of planar, co-rotating distributions of satellite galaxies around L* host galaxies in the local universe remains a subject of ongoing debate. Despite numerous observational efforts over the past decade, a statistically robust sample of "satellite planes" across the diversity of host galaxy environments is lacking. To guide future observing strategies, we construct a controlled suite of mock observations of on-sky positions and line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of isolated L* host galaxies and their satellite systems, based on samples drawn from the Illustris TNG100-1 cosmological simulation to build a statistical sample. In these mock systems, satellite planes are defined by three key parameters: the number of satellites ($N_{\mathrm{sat}}$), the fraction residing in a thin co-rotating plane ($f_{p}$), and the orientation angle relative to the observer ($\theta_{\mathrm{rot}}$). We evaluate the sensitivity of three observational metrics, $N_{\mathrm{cor}}$ (number of co-rotating satellites), $b/a$ (projected flattening of the satellite distribution), and $v_\mathrm{los}$ (mean absolute LOS velocity), to the presence of such planes. Our results show that detection rates are strongly dependent on $\theta_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{sat}}$. Satellite planes that are viewed nearly edge-on or face-on, are the most readily detected. In contrast, intermediate orientations and systems with fewer satellites yield low detection success rates. Generally, only satellite planes with $N_{\mathrm{sat}}&gt;20$ have high chances of being detected. These findings provide a practical framework for prioritising observational targets and designing future surveys aimed at detecting and characterising satellite planes.</description>

      <title>Formation of dusty clumps in the torus of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The putative dusty torus is a key ingredient of the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei (AGN), but its origin remains a mystery. Here we put forward a new physical model to explain how a large number of small dusty gas clumps form and they collectively appear as a geometrically thick dynamic dusty torus. The circumnuclear hot gas flows towards the central black hole (BH) and forms a rotating disk on sub-pc scales. A fraction of inflowing hot gas condenses to form small cold clumps due to thermal instabilities, when the accretion rate is sufficiently high. These cold dusty gas clumps are irradiated by the central accretion disk and re-radiate as dust emission mostly in the infrared. We propose that the dusty torus in AGN consists of such cold clumps vertically supported by the radiation force against gravity. For clumps with suitable column density, the vertical component of the BH gravity is in quasi-static equilibrium with the infrared radiation force together with the vertical component of the disk radiation force. Our model is robust in the sense that for any reasonable range of parameters concerning clump vertical dynamical equilibrium a torus exists. We further show that the hot gas in the rotating flow condenses to cold clumps only if its accretion rate is higher than about one percent of the Eddington rate. The radiation force is unable to lift the cold gas clumps up away from the mid-plane when the luminosity of the disk surrounding the BH is lower than 0.1 percent of the Eddington luminosity. These two features of our model may provide a physical explanation for the lack of evidence of dusty tori in low-luminosity AGNs.</description>

      <title>Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow -- III. Environmental trends and halo-to-halo scatter in the Pop III IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generations of stars ionised and enriched their host galaxies and seeded the growth of massive black holes. Models often assume that Pop III stellar masses in different minihaloes are stochastic realisations of a single universal initial mass function (IMF). We use 138 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamics simulations to test this assumption and to map the first-star IMF across redshift, halo mass, and baryon-dark matter streaming velocity (SV). We construct a dense-cloud merger tree and assign first-star masses by mapping the radial gas accretion-rate profile to stellar mass, yielding per-halo stellar mass functions without imposing any a priori IMF. The high-mass tail and multiplicity increase systematically with redshift, halo mass, and SV. Low-mass, low-SV haloes form only one or a few first stars, whereas massive, high-SV haloes host rich first star clusters and commonly produce very massive ($\gtrsim10^3$-$10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$) first stars. Even in a fixed environment, halo-to-halo scatter remains substantial. Nevertheless, group-averaged IMFs converge to well-defined forms, ruling out a single universal IMF at the halo level across the range of environments probed here. Mapping our seeds onto the redshift-mass plane, we show that high-SV and massive haloes preferentially populate the heavy-seed regime relevant to luminous high-redshift sources. At the same time, low-SV environments are consistent with single/few-event enrichment signatures in metal-poor stars. Our results deliver a practical, physically motivated prescription for per-halo IMF.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in the cosmic web: the relative impact of nodes and filaments in the EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve within the intricate geometry of the cosmic web, yet the distinct roles of its primary components - nodes and filaments remain incompletely understood. Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we investigate how distances to filament spines and cluster-scale nodes jointly and independently influence galaxy evolution. Galaxies are classified into red, green, and blue populations through a fully data-driven entropic thresholding technique, and the nodes and filaments are identified using DisPerSE. We find that red galaxies preferentially reside near filament cores and nodes, whereas blue galaxies dominate the outskirts. This spatial segregation reveals two characteristic transition scales: a node-related crossover at $\sim 2.5~\mathrm{Mpc}$ and a filament-related crossover at $\sim 0.75~\mathrm{Mpc}$. To further quantify environmental influence, we adopt an information-theoretic approach and measure the normalised mutual information between dominant mass component and galaxy colour across the $d_{\mathrm{f}}$-$d_{\mathrm{n}}$ plane. The mass-colour coupling increases with distance from nodes at fixed filament proximity, indicating a weakening of this relation in cluster-scale environments and a stronger coupling within filamentary regions. This behaviour is strongly mass dependent, with low-mass galaxies exhibiting a more pronounced environmental modulation than high-mass systems. These results support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution across the cosmic web, highlighting the distinct and complementary influence of nodes and filaments.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study of nearby starburst galaxy M 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of the nearby starburst galaxy M 82 by combining high-resolution Far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat and archival Chandra X-ray observations. Using FUV flux measurements, we estimate a spatially-resolved star formation rate (SFR) across several star-forming clumps within a radius of $\sim$3.6 kpc, finding a total SFR of 0.022 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The H$_{\alpha}$ recombination line flux yields an SFR of $\sim$0.010 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, while the infrared-based SFR derived from 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ emission is significantly higher at 16 - 18 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, suggesting that a substantial fraction of star formation in M 82 is heavily dust-obscured. Morphological comparison of FUV, H$_{\alpha}$, mid-infrared, and soft X-ray emission reveals a strong spatial correlation, tracing multi-phase outflows along the galaxy's minor axis. X-ray spectral analysis using a three-temperature $\texttt{VAPEC}$ model shows enhanced abundances of Ne, Mg, Si, and S, consistent with enrichment from Type-II supernovae. These results demonstrate the importance of combining UV, optical, IR, and X-ray observations to probe both obscured and unobscured star formation, the metal enrichment, and the outflow-driven evolution of starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Salpeter IMF and an NFW halo: Disentangling the dark and stellar mass through precise lens modelling of a double-source-plane system reinforces the canonical model of elliptical galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strong lensing analysis of the double source plane lens J0946+1006 (colloquially "Jackpot" lens) to measure the inner dark matter density profile, the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and the stellar initial mass function normalisation using a two component stellar plus dark matter mass model. The stellar mass follows a multi-Gaussian expansion light model with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial $M/L$ gradient, while the dark matter is described by an elliptical generalised NFW halo. The double-source-plane geometry provides additional leverage against the mass-sheet transformation and helps constrain the radial mass profile. Despite allowing both a radial stellar $M/L$ gradient and a generalised NFW halo, the data prefer the canonical picture: an approximately constant stellar mass-to-light ratio with a Salpeter-like IMF normalisation, and a dark matter halo consistent with NFW. We infer $M_{\star} = 4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ and an inner halo slope $\gamma_{\rm in}^{\rm halo} = 1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$. The halo mass is $M_{200}^{\rm halo} = 1.11^{+0.37}_{-0.32}\times 10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$, implying $\log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\star})=1.41^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$. At fixed halo mass, the inferred stellar mass lies $\sim0.1$ dex above typical literature stellar halo mass relations at similar redshift, which is comparable to the intrinsic scatter of these relations. We expect this approach to provide a practical template for future dark matter studies with the large double-source-plane lens samples from Euclid.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dynamically-formed massive black holes in Little Red Dots from X-ray non-detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21002v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of massive, compact galaxies (Little Red Dots, LRDs) at $z \sim 2$ challenges early structure formation models, suggesting rapid stellar and black hole (BH) assembly. While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column density. Our results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $&gt; 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs.</description>

      <title>HINORA II: Testing the Existence of the Council of Giants in {\Lambda}CDM simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the galaxy ring known as the Council of Giants (CoG) highlights the need to explain such structures in the Local Universe. In the first paper of this series we presented HINORA - a code to locate (ring-like) structures in 3D point sets - and used it to identify the CoG in the most complete observations of the Local Volume. Here, in Part II, we apply the same method to cosmological simulations to quantify the possible existence of such objects in the LCDM model of structure formation. We analyze DM-only simulations with random and constrained initial conditions, selecting regions that reproduce the properties of the Local Group and Volume, respectively. In order to use the same selection criteria as previsouly done for observations, we relate K-band luminosities to halo masses through semi-empirical relations. After confirming that the selected regions from the simulations match the observed mass function and density of the Local Universe, we use HINORA to search for ring-like structures in them. We find that the existence of CoGs in LCDM simulations is a rather unusual phenomenon. The observed CoG represents an anomaly of more than 2.7 sigma from what is expected in the distribution of massive galaxies in LCDM. These results hint that the CoG could either be a rare chance configuration or the imprint of physical processes at intermediate scales that standard DM-only simulations fail to capture.</description>

      <title>MHD Simulations of Strongly Magnetized HII Region Evolution: Evidence for Ionized Gas Filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of HII regions in the Central Molecular Zone have shown a highly filamentary morphology distinct from HII regions in other parts of the galaxy. We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of strongly magnetized (plasma-$\beta$ &lt;&lt; 1) HII region evolution that investigate and describe the formation of these ionized gas filaments. HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone. Given that these filaments are effectively magnetically-confined flows of photoionized gas, their density and curvature are influenced by the density of the blob and the geometry of the configuration.</description>

      <title>Experimental and computational studies of the hydrogenation of carbon disulfide (CS2) on ice analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon disulfide (CS$_2$) is one of the sulfur-bearing species expected to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we investigated the surface reactions of solid CS$_2$ with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) using laboratory experiments supported by computational calculations. Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces. These processes lead to the formation of several sulfur-bearing species, including hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S), methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH), and small amounts of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) and methanedithiol (CH$_2$(SH)$_2$). The observed reactivity of CS$_2$ with H atoms provides a plausible explanation for the non-detection of CS$_2$ in interstellar ices. Furthermore, the efficient hydrogenation of the complex molecules derived from CS$_2$, namely HC(S)SH and CH$_2$(SH)$_2$, suggests that these species could be easily undergone with H atoms to produce other S-bearing species under ISM conditions.</description>

      <title>Scattering, Migration, Re-circularization and Relaxation to Build Out Galaxy Disks with Exponential Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering of stars by interstellar clouds or massive clumps increases the stellar velocity dispersion and promotes a radial disk profile that is exponential. Here we show that such scattering reaches a steady-state distribution function of stellar eccentricity, after which eccentricity increases and decreases occur at equal rates. The implication is that clump/cloud scattering recircularizes eccentric stellar orbits, keeping the stellar velocity dispersion in a limited range. This re-circularization regulates disk heating and maintains kinematic coherence, contributing to the longevity of disk structures. The eccentricity distribution function and the presence of recircularizing cloud-star interactions are independent of cloud mass but the timescale to reach equilibrium decreases with increasing mass. The calculations are made in the simplest possible disk system to highlight the effects of scattering without contamination from spiral waves, star formation, and other processes. The calculations also reveal a bifurcation in the disk evolutions whereby in a minority of cases temporary asymmetries in the clump spatial distribution drive the disks to an end state of increased velocity dispersion and orbital eccentricity corresponding to early type disks. Overall the models emphasize an important physical process that can make and maintain an exponential stellar disk in all galaxies with a cloudy interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program. IX. The RR Lyrae Population in WLM with HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars are a common, dependable Population II distance indicator, and provide an independent tracer of early star formation. Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $\mu = 24.85\pm0.05$ ($0.93\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Spectra and Metal Budget Regulated by the Galactic Wind</title>

Abstract: We study the advection effect of the Galactic wind on the local cosmic ray spectra. The spectral hardening from a few hundred GV and softening from a few TV are reproduced by a velocity profile with a maximum velocity of $\sim 700~\mbox{km}~ \mbox{s}^{-1}$ without introducing a break in the power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient. Additionally, we find that a hard CR spectrum below $\sim$ TV with an index of $\sim 2$ at an altitude $\sim 3$-$5$ kpc from the Galactic disk. This hard spectrum is favorable for the gamma-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles. With the obtained CR fluxes, we discuss the matter circulation in our Galaxy with the wind. While the wind has an essential role in maintaining the metal abundance in the disk, the production rate of Beryllium, which originates from CR spallation, is so low that the ratio Be/O in the halo should be larger than that in the disk gas.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity XIV. Properties of SMC late-O and B supergiants reveal the metallicity dependence of winds in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the physics of radiation-driven winds of massive stars, the wind properties should depend on the metal content of the stellar atmosphere. Therefore, studying the winds of massive stars in different metallicities provides a sanity check on prescriptions that are widely used in evolutionary calculations. We obtained the stellar and wind properties of a sample of 20 late-O and B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from a quantitative combined UV and optical spectroscopic analysis using CMFGEN. By comparing these properties with those of a Large Magellanic Cloud counterpart study, which has a similar sample and data, and employed the same modelling techniques used in this study, We derived a metallicity-dependent recipe for wind momentum, which is applicable for $5.4 \leq \log{L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot}} \leq6.1$ and $14 \leq T_{\rm eff}/{\rm kK} \leq 32$. We find a significant dependence of the wind momentum on the metallicity, which is largely due to the mass-loss rates. We do not find any evidence of a discontinuity in either the mass-loss rate or the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity between $25$ and $21$~kK, which could be attributed to the bi-stability jump. Stellar parameters are consistent across different methods and radiative transfer codes, whereas mass-loss rates differ significantly, with our values being generally lower. We find a discrepancy between the evolutionary and spectroscopic masses in $40\%$ of our sample, with the evolutionary mass usually being systematically higher. The mass-loss rates of blue supergiants are far too low to strip the stellar envelope and the subsequent formation of classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, leading to the conclusion that luminous blue variable eruptions or binary interactions are necessary to explain the characteristics of the WR population in the SMC.</description>

      <title>Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess from a Generic Triaxial Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of Galactic surveys, such as Gaia, have revealed that the Milky Way's gravitational potential comes from a matter distribution that is triaxial and rotated with respect to the Galactic center-Sun axis. This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with galaxy clusters using machine learning. Application to eROSITA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20483v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\sigma_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Multiple protostellar outflows from a single protostar with a misaligned disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how misalignment between the core angular momentum and the large-scale magnetic field affects protostellar outflows, and whether a single protostellar system can drive multiple outflow components. We perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized rotating cores, focusing on the formation of a protostar, a circumstellar disk, and magnetically driven outflows. The initial angle between the core angular-momentum vector and the magnetic field is systematically varied from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. All models launch a classical magnetocentrifugal disk wind (DW) roughly along the local disk normal. For large misalignment, the system also develops a spiralflow (SF) component that propagates parallel to the disk plane. In a representative model with a $60^\circ$ misalignment, the outflow transitions from a DW-dominated to an SF-dominated phase, with the SF becoming more massive and more extended than the DW, and the two components intermittently coexisting. Across the model suite, the maximum mass and size ratios of SF to DW, as well as the relative lifetimes of the two components, increase for misalignment angles $\gtrsim60^\circ$. We propose that secondary, misaligned outflows (or their fossil remnants) observed in some protostellar systems can be interpreted as the SF component, while the main bipolar outflow traces the DW from the same misaligned system.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abvb: a Type Ibn/Icn supernova with evidence of helium and an extreme offset from its host galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations and analysis of SN 2024abvb, a peculiar transitional Type Ibn/Icn supernova located at an unusually large projected distance from its host galaxy (21.5 kpc). SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\sc ii} $\lambda$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\sc i} $\lambda$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae.</description>

      <title>XRISM Discovery of Multiple Ionized Fe-K Emission and Absorption Components in Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first clear detection of ionized Fe-K emission and absorption components in the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A, revealed by the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve detector. In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band. Our findings establish a new benchmark in the study of circumnuclear environments in low-luminosity radio galaxies, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of AGN unification.</description>

      <title>Constraints on CMBR flux due to high-z dust emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gjergo &amp; Kroupa (2025) have proposed a new foreground CMBR component produced by dust associated with the progenitor clouds at $z=15-20$ that led to the formation of massive early-type galaxies, calculating that a minimum of 1.4% and a maximum of 100% of the whole CMBR radiation would be produced by this mechanism. Here, I check how much dust emission is compatible with the spectrum of the CMBR monopole flux measurements within the corresponding errors. COBE-FIRAS monopole is fitted to different models with different dust emissivity spectral indexes ($\beta $) and dispersion of redshifts of the progenitor clouds ($\sigma _d$). Within the realistic values of $\beta \ge 0.5$, $\sigma _d\ge 0.8$, the contamination of CMBR flux by high $z$ dust should be $&lt;1.3$% (95% CL).</description>

      <title>A Catalog of 486 Barium Stars Identified in GALAH DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 486 Ba stars identified in the GALAH DR4 survey using high-resolution spectra and precise abundance measurements. The sample was selected based on s-process enrichment criteria involving the abundances of Ba and La relative to Eu, and further refined using the signed-distance method, resulting in the largest sample of Ba stars to date, including five newly identified Ba dwarfs. Using astrometric and kinematic parameters from Gaia DR3 and StarHorse, we derived the Galactic velocity components for 367 Ba stars and found that most belong to the thin or thick disk, while 18 exhibit halo-like kinematics. Chemical abundance analysis suggests that most Ba stars are of in situ origin, whereas two stars (4077588766331013248 and 6692980582560946304) display signatures of accreted populations. The E-Lz diagram further shows that star 4077588766331013248 lies within the region of substructure ED-8. The observed decline of [Ba/Fe] and [La/Fe] with increasing metallicity implies that s-process elements originate from nucleosynthetic sites distinct from those of iron-peak elements, while the decreasing [hs/ls] ratio toward higher metallicity indicates higher neutron capture efficiency at lower metallicity. Both giant and dwarf Ba stars-except for 6053735173729807872-are confirmed binaries hosting white dwarf companions. Moreover, we estimated the masses of the former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions to these Ba stars based on the good agreement between the FRUITY AGB model predictions and their observed abundance patterns.</description>

      <title>Simulations of the 21cm emission line for upcoming large-scale HI galaxy surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys with the SKA Observatory will detect neutral hydrogen (HI) across unprecedented volumes, and their scientific return will crucially depend on predictive models for HI observables. In this work, we present a framework to simulate the neutral hydrogen 21cm emission line in such large-scale HI galaxy surveys. This framework is developed as a modular layer that builds on semi-analytical models. In particular we use as bases the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) and L-Galaxies semi-analytical models, coupled to merger trees from the Millennium Simulation suite. We validate our framework against local Universe observations, demonstrating consistency with velocity functions, and generalised Tully-Fisher relations. Predictions based on GAEA and L-Galaxies exhibit mutual consistency despite the distinct underlying physical prescriptions. We construct mock galaxy catalogues that incorporate forward-modelled selection functions, inclination effects, and redshift broadening, reproducing the statistical distributions of HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey. Finally, we present redshift distribution forecasts for future SKA Observatory HI galaxy surveys. This framework offers a flexible tool for interpreting upcoming large-scale radio surveys and studying HI line observables as cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>A Detection of Circumgalactic Dust at Megaparsec Scales with Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the more surprising astrophysical discoveries of the last decade has been the presence of enormous quantities of dust at megaparsec distances from galaxies, which has important implications for galaxy evolution, the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium, and observational cosmology. In this work, we present a novel method for studying these vast halos of circumgalactic dust: a maximum-likelihood estimator for dust-induced extinction of background galaxies. This estimator can accommodate a broad range of archival photometric data and can incorporate different dust reddening prescriptions, making it applicable to diverse galaxy types and redshifts. We apply the estimator to the redMaGiC catalog of luminous red galaxies, selected for their tight dispersion in color and well-constrained photometric redshifts, and measure the resulting extinction as a function of projected distance from WISExSuperCOSMOS and redMaGiC foreground galaxies. We detect significant dust-induced extinction profiles extending to at least 1 megaparsec from galactic disks, with noticeable differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies: star-forming galaxies exhibit a pronounced rise in extinction within the inner 50 kiloparsecs and a steep decline beyond 1 megaparsec, while the quiescent galaxies host little dust in the inner halo but have detectable extinction out to 30 megaparsecs. We test the robustness of our results using star catalogs and inverted foreground and background samples and find no evidence for significant systematic error. Our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the interplay between circumgalactic dust, galaxy evolution, and large-scale structure, with potential applications in a number of astrophysical subfields.</description>

Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey II: the connection between the escape of ionizing radiation and Lyman-alpha halos in star-forming galaxies</title>

Abstract: One of the current challenges in galaxy evolution studies is to establish the mechanisms that govern the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies. Here, we investigate the connection between Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape and the conditions of the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM), as probed by Ly$\alpha$ halos (LAHs) in emission. We use Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum imaging data from the Lyman alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS), targeting 42 nearby ($z \simeq 0.3$), star-forming galaxies with LyC observations (escape fractions of $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} \simeq 0.01-0.49$). LaCOS galaxies show extended Ly$\alpha$ emission ubiquitously, with LyC emitters (LCEs) having more compact Ly$\alpha$ morphologies than non-LCEs, and Ly$\alpha$ spatial offsets that do not exceed the extent of the UV continuum. We model the diffuse LAHs using a combined S\'ersic plus exponential 2D profile, and find that the characteristic scale length of the Ly$\alpha$ halo is ten times larger than the UV, on average. We unveil a significant anti-correlation between $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ and the Ly$\alpha$ Halo Fraction (HF, or contribution of the halo to the total Ly$\alpha$ luminosity), that we propose as a new LyC indicator. Our observations show that halo scale lengths and HFs both scale positively with the optical depth of the neutral gas in the ISM, revealing a picture in which Ly$\alpha$ and LyC photons in LCEs either emerge directly from the central starbursts or escape isotropically and, in the case of Ly$\alpha$, minimize the number of scattering interactions in a less-extended CGM.</description>

      <title>Insights into the structure and kinematics of a Milky Way-like galaxy</title>

Abstract: Understanding how the large-scale kinematics of the MW shape the formation and evolution of the interstellar medium remains challenging from an observational perspective, and numerical models that can reproduce the observed structure and kinematics of the MW are much needed in order to infer how the MW might work as a star formation engine. This work aims to use a numerical framework that is a close match to the observed large-scale distribution of stars and gas in the MW to isolate and understand the impact of galaxy-driven flows on the formation, agglomeration, and longevity of spiral patterns, prior to the inclusion of chemistry, star formation, and feedback. We use an isothermal simulation of a MW-like galaxy, found to closely match the longitude-velocity observational features of the MW in previous work, that includes the coupled evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter under purely gravitational and hydrodynamical processes. We characterise the morphology and kinematics of the stars and gas in the disc, quantify velocity residuals and their association with spiral features, and analyse the time-evolution of individual spiral-ridge segments. Our results demonstrate that our model reproduces many observed MW structural and kinematic signatures, from the inner Galaxy to the Solar neighbourhood, supporting its suitability as an analogue of the MW. The stellar spiral pattern in our model is relatively weak and shows lower multiplicity relative to the sharper gaseous arms, offering an explanation for discrepancies in observational determinations of the number and location of MW spiral arms. Both gas and stellar spiral arms are highly segmented, without a single coherent spiral pattern as expected from a grand-design type of galaxy. We find strong radial motions linked to the non-circular motions driven by the presence of a bar, and which extend well into the disc. The gas radial and...</description>

      <title>High-resolution Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope H{\sc i} 21\,cm imaging of the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) H{\sc i} 21\,cm imaging of NGC\,4141, the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT H{\sc i} 21\,cm images have spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and (iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas, via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase. Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $&lt;3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio luminosity of such an associated persistent radio source.</description>

      <title>Feeding the Dead: Neutral Gas Inflow in a Long-Quenched Ancient Massive Galaxy at $z\sim 2.7$ Observed with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic detection of neutral gas inflow into a massive ($M_* \simeq 4\times 10^{10} M_\odot$) quiescent galaxy observed at $z_{\rm{spec}} = 2.6576$ with JWST. From the redshifted absorption of the NaI doublet at $\lambda \lambda 5890, 5896 $ Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity $v=278^{+79}_{-79}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a column density $\log(N_{NaI}/\rm{cm^2}) = 13.02^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$. We derive the inflowing mass of the gas $M_{in} = 1.6^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^8 M_\odot$ and rate $\dot{M}_{in} = 19^{+6}_{-7} \, M_\odot \, \rm{yr}^{-1}$. The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of $0.2 \, M_\odot \, \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past $\sim1$ Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift $z_{50}=11^{+18}_{-3}$. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.</description>

      <title>High Resolution (&lt;100pc) Ionization Structures in the ISM of AGN ESO~137-G34</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed, spatially resolved { Veilleux \&amp; Osterbrock (VO) diagram} analysis of ESO\,137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based on narrowband {\it HST} imaging in [O~III], [S~II], H$\alpha$, and H$\beta$ emission lines. The narrowband optical emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission observed with \textit{Chandra}. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-, and H~II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim20$\,pc at $z=0.009$). To { visualize} the fine spatial structure of the { ISM excitation}, we introduce a new parameter: the Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point in the { VO} diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. { SLI mapping reveals fine spatial structures in the ISM excitation especially in the Seyfert ionization bi-cones where the statistical significance of our data is higher.} Most of the emission within the bi-cones is Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with regions of the { VO} diagram that can be modeled with AGN photoionization. In the North-West Seyfert cone three radial SLI peaks suggest episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$\,yrs and $&lt;100$\,yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced soft X-ray emission at the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($&gt;1000$\,km\,s$^{-1}$) induced excitation. The North-West cone is surrounded by a smooth LINER ``cocoon''. The LINER region in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.</description>

      <title>First Statistical Detection of MgII-traced Cool Gas Outflows with JWST Towards Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of \ion{Mg}{2}-traced cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \approx 1$ to $z &gt; 6$ (with sample coverage extending to $z \sim 10$). Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ion{Mg}{2} $\lambda\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ion{Mg}{2} absorption in nearly all stellar mass and redshift bins, with the exception of the lowest-mass systems at $z \sim 1-2$. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, with the fitted slope of $1.21 \pm 0.35$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on \ion{Mg}{2}-traced cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$), high-redshift ($z &gt; 3$) regime. We also find that the outflow velocities generally remain below the host halo escape velocities, consistent with a galactic fountain scenario. The consistency of the stellar mass-outflow equivalent width relation across $z \sim 2-6$ suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle towards cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of H I and O VI Absorbers: Insights into the Turbulence Driver of the Multiphase Circumgalactic Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate large-scale gas kinematics in the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) using the observed correlation between line width (Doppler $b$ parameter) and column density ($N$) for H I and O VI absorbers. Leveraging extensive public galaxy survey data at $z\lesssim0.1$, we construct a new galaxy sample based on the availability of background Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs) with far-ultraviolet spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\rm HI}$, from $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{18}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\rm OVI}\approx 3\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$.We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\rm H}$ and $n_{\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\rm OVI}$-$N_{\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas -- with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal interactions with the central supermassive black hole. Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the central 2 kpc of our galaxy. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity. Unlike previously identified A- and B-type HVSs, DESI-312 is a $\sim 1\,M_{\odot}$ star on the main sequence or early subgiant branch, thus enabling a detailed chemical analysis of its atmosphere and offering a rare window - unobscured by dust and crowding - into the composition of the central regions of the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($\delta &gt;\sim0^{\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $\gamma$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $\gamma$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems.</description>

      <title>The morphological stability of open clusters: a new 2D perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) usually evolve gradually as the number of their members changes, which can be manifested in their morphological characteristics. We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140$\pm$0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720$\pm$0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083$\pm$0.116 and 0.733$\pm$0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013$\pm$0.110 and 0.529$\pm$0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751$\pm$0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442$\pm$0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.</description>

      <title>Cool-Core Destruction in Merging Clusters with AGN Feedback and Radiative Cooling</title>

Abstract: The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.</description>

      <title>Chasing the Light: Shadowing, Collimation, and the Super-Eddington Growth of Infant Black Holes in JWST BLAGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines. We propose that a subset of these BLAGNs, the so-called "Little Blue Dots'' (LBDs) are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate photon scattering and shadowing within the polar funnel. Our models predict extremely-blue optical-UV continuum slopes and highly collimated radiation fields where isotropic-equivalent luminosities exceed the Eddington limit in the polar direction while shadowing suppresses emission at higher inclinations. This "searchlight" configuration naturally generates a stratified ionization structure: coronal and high-excitation narrow lines are produced along the symmetry axis, while the equatorial broad-line region (BLR) remains shielded from the hardest ionizing photons. We show that the anisotropic illumination of the BLR explains the observed faintness of high-ionization lines despite strong Balmer emission. For M_BH=10^7.5--10^8 Msun accretors at Eddington ratio ~10, standard BLR conditions predict HeII lambda 4686/Hbeta in the range 0.08--0.28. Notably, because inherently blue disk spectra provide a much higher ratio of ionizing to optical photons than standard quasar composites, the observed large Balmer equivalent widths are matched with typical BLR covering factors without invoking enshrouded geometries. Taken together, these findings support the view that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries, may naturally account for the ionizing SED and emission line diagnostics of high-z LBDs, while offering a plausible pathway to rapid black hole growth at cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as a new tool to characterise the Milky Way Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a star-forming region rich in molecular clouds located within hundreds of parsecs from the centre of our Galaxy, converts gas into stars less efficiently than anticipated. A key challenge in refining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense molecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent results. We demonstrate how, in the near future, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer due to worldwide advancements in neutrino telescopes. Neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when cosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds. The neutrino production rate is proportional to the gas density without dependence on the complex properties of a cloud. Neutrinos also have the advantage of negligible absorption and unambiguous production channels, making it a method with the lowest systematic uncertainties. In an optimistic case where most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from pion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about two decades. Neutrinos from the CMZ will provide indications on the biases of traditional mass tracers and thus indirectly enhance the accuracy of gas measurements in far galaxies from which a neutrino signal is not detectable.</description>

      <title>Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large-distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale-dependent coupling governed by an anomalous dimension $\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum-field-theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Modeling Binary Lenses and Sources with the BAGLE Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. In this work, we introduce binary source and lens models into the gravitational lensing formalism encoded in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) python software package. These new binary models in BAGLE account for Keplerian orbits. We also add binary models with fewer parameters that describe the binary orbital motion as acceleration, linear, or stationary motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to uniquely determine physical parameters like mass and distance, unlike photometry-only microlensing which often yield ambiguous solutions. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.</description>

      <title>SN 2022ngb: A faint, slowly evolving Type IIb supernova with a low-mass envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.</description>

      <title>CLiMB: A Domain-Informed Novelty Detection Clustering Framework for Galactic Archaeology and Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using metric-adaptive constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three distinct dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.</description>
