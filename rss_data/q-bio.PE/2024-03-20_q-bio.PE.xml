      <title>Evaluation cartographique du niveau de potentialit{\'e}s {\'e}cologiques des sites des partenaires (CARPO). Cadre m{\'e}thodologique V0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cartographic Assessment of Ecological Potential (CARPO) allows users to characterize the ecological context of a group of sites at several scales (its perimeter and surrounding area) and on the basis of 4 themes: biodiversity zonings, land use (major types of environment, natural character and degree of permeability of territories), ecological connectivity (biodiversity reservoirs and corridors, non-fragmentation of the sector studied), as well as the richness of the territory in terms of heritage species. It is based on a battery of 8 indicators linked to these themes and a system of evaluation thresholds, used to define 3 levels of ecological potential (average, strong and very strong) for each indicator and at each scale of study. The level of potentiality reflects the importance that an ecological element takes on in a study area, and therefore the degree of contribution and responsibility of a site in maintaining this element favorable to biodiversity. It also translates into an alert level for biodiversity that needs to be taken into account at a site.The ecological diagnosis is materialized by means of a cartographic atlas containing a set of commented maps and figures, as well as evaluation grids and radars for the various indicators.CARPO is a decision-making tool, as it enables users to compare the ecological potential within a site with that of its surroundings, in order to define preservation, management or restoration actions; and to compare the extent of potential between the different sites in the group, with a goal of prioritizing action.This guide presents the methodological framework for applying CARPO to a group of sites.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic spreading of predator-prey populations in a shifting environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies associating shifting temperature conditions with changes in the efficiency of predator species in converting their prey to offspring, we propose a predator-prey model of reaction-diffusion type to analyze the consequence of such effects on the population dynamics and spread of species. In the model, the predator conversion efficiency is represented by a spatially heterogeneous function depending on the variable $\xi=x-c_1t$ for some given $c_1&gt;0$. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach, we provide explicit formulas for the spreading speed of the predator species. When the conversion function is monotone increasing, the spreading speed is determined in all cases and non-local pulling is possible. When the function is monotone decreasing, we provide formulas for the spreading speed when the rate of shift of the conversion function is sufficiently fast or slow.</description>

      <title>Concepts and methods for predicting viral evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seasonal human influenza virus undergoes rapid evolution, leading to significant changes in circulating viral strains from year to year. These changes are typically driven by adaptive mutations, particularly in the antigenic epitopes, the regions of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin targeted by human antibodies. Here we describe a consistent set of methods for data-driven predictive analysis of viral evolution. Our pipeline integrates four types of data: (1) sequence data of viral isolates collected on a worldwide scale, (2) epidemiological data on incidences, (3) antigenic characterization of circulating viruses, and (4) intrinsic viral phenotypes. From the combined analysis of these data, we obtain estimates of relative fitness for circulating strains and predictions of clade frequencies for periods of up to one year. Furthermore, we obtain comparative estimates of protection against future viral populations for candidate vaccine strains, providing a basis for pre-emptive vaccine strain selection. Continuously updated predictions obtained from the prediction pipeline for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are available on the website https://previr.app.</description>

      <title>Invariance of fixation probability in Moran-like Processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The now famous Isothermal Theorem was introduced in a Nature Communications article in 2005 by Nowak and Liebermann and has since been the founding document of the rich field of evolutionary graph theory. Unfortunately, the Isothermal Theorem has never been proven completely. The main argument, that the projection of the graph dynamics is a Markovian Birth-and-Death- Process, is not applicable in general and leaves the question open for the case, when the projection is not Markov. To complete the proof, we first generalise the model by Liebermann and Nowak, by introducing a non-uniform selection policy to select an individual for procreation. Then, we use a martingale argument to prove that selecting with a specific selection policy related to the weight matrix of the underlying population graph still gives rise to Moran fixation probability, even outside of the framework of the original Isothermal Theorem. Our proof includes and completes the proof of the Isothermal Theorem. We follow up with a small numerical study that shows that the set of spatial Moran Processes with Moran fixation probability is even richer than previously understood. The initial condition and the selection policy play an important role in this.</description>

      <title>Settlement Mapping for Population Density Modelling in Disease Risk Spatial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disease risk spatial analysis, many researchers especially in Indonesia are still modelling population density as the ratio of total population to administrative area extent. This model oversimplifies the problem, because it covers large uninhabited areas, while the model should focus on inhabited areas. This study uses settlement mapping against satellite imagery to focus the model and calculate settlement area extent. As far as our search goes, we did not find any specific studies comparing the use of settlement mapping with administrative area to model population density in computing its correlation to a disease case rate. This study investigates the comparison of both models using data on Tuberculosis (TB) case rate in Central and East Java Indonesia. Our study shows that using administrative area density the Spearman's $\rho$ was considered as "Fair" (0.566, p&lt;0.01) and using settlement density was "Moderately Strong" (0.673, p&lt;0.01). The difference is significant according to Hotelling's t test. By this result we are encouraging researchers to use settlement mapping to improve population density modelling in disease risk spatial analysis.

      <title>On the uniqueness of the maximum parsimony tree for data with few substitutions within the NNI neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating species relationship trees, so-called phylogenetic trees, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated).
  On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present manuscript to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt; \frac{n}{8}+\frac{6}{5}-\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{\frac{5}{16} n^2+4}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;8 k-\frac{46}{5}+\frac{2}{5} \sqrt{40 k-31} $), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on a given tree $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively.</description>
