      <title>Electrical conductivity of the Quark-Gluon Plasma in the presence of strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the electrical conductivity of the strongly interacting medium in the presence of strong magnetic background fields, $eB=4,9~GeV^2$, and for different values of the temperature, both in the confined and in the deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase. The conductivity is obtained from the Euclidean lattice time correlator of the electrical current, computed on gauge configurations sampled from Monte-Carlo simulations of an improved staggered discretization of $N_f = 2+1$ QCD. We perform the inverse Laplace transform of the correlator adopting a recently-proposed version of the standard Backus--Gilbert procedure for the inversion. The results obtained in the QGP phase show a sizable enhancement of the conductivity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, as well as a suppression in the direction orthogonal to it. Such enhancement could be attributed to the manifestation of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME): following this guess, we extract the behaviour of the relaxation time of this process, extrapolate it to the continuum limit and compare it to previous results, finding it lower than expected in the explored range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Fully heavy tetraquark resonant states with different flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the quark potential model to calculate the mass spectrum of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark systems with different flavors, including the $ bc\bar b\bar c, bb\bar c\bar c, cc\bar c\bar b $ and $ bb\bar b\bar c $ systems. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, and the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. The $ bc\bar b\bar c, bb\bar c\bar c, cc\bar c\bar b $ and $ bb\bar b\bar c $ resonant states are obtained in the mass regions of $ (13.2,13.5) $, $ (13.3,13.6) $, $ (10.0,10.3) $, $ (16.5,16.7) $ GeV, respectively. Among these states, the $ bc\bar b\bar c $ tetraquark states are the most promising ones to be discovered in the near future. We recommend the experimental exploration of the $ 1^{++} $ and $ 2^{++} $ $ bc\bar b\bar c $ states with masses near $ 13.3 $ GeV in the $ J/\psi\Upsilon $ channel. From the root-mean-square radii, we find that all the resonant states we have identified are compact tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Numerical exploration of the bootstrap in spin chain models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the bootstrap approach (a dual optimization method to the variational approach) to one-dimensional spin chains, leveraging semidefinite programming to extract numerical results. We study how correlation functions in the ground state converge to their true values at and away from criticality and at relaxed optimality. We consider the transverse Ising model, the three state Potts model, and other non-integrable spin chains and investigate to what extent semidefinite methods can reliably extract numerical emergent physical data, including conformal central charges, correlation lengths and scaling dimensions. We demonstrate procedures to extract these data and show preliminary results in the various models considered. We compare to exact analytical results and to exact diagonalization when the system volume is small enough. When we attempt to go to the thermodynamic limit, the semidefinite numerical method with translation invariance imposed as a constraint finds the solution with periodic boundary conditions even if these have not been specified. This implies that the determination of all conformal data in correlators has to be handled at finite volume. Our investigation reveals that the approach has practical challenges. In particular, the correlation functions extracted from the optimal solution, which function as slack variables in the optimization, have convergence issues that suggest an underlying exponential complexity in the system size.</description>

      <title>Time-kernel for lattice determinations of NLO hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time-momentum representation of the kernel needed to compute hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$ in the space-like region at next-to-leading order. For small values of the time, we present analytical series expansions; for large values of the time, we present numerical series expansions which overcome the problems showed by na\"ive asymptotic expansions. These results are to be employed in lattice QCD determination of hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$ at next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Higgs-confinement continuity and matching of Aharonov-Bohm phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some gauge theories with a spontaneously broken $U(1)$ symmetry exhibit fractional Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases around vortices in the Higgs regime. We discuss continuity between confining and Higgs regimes in such gauge theories with fundamental matter fields, focusing on the AB phases. By explicit calculations in relevant lattice models, we demonstrate that the AB phase is smoothly connected between the confining and Higgs regimes, supporting the Higgs-confinement continuity. This result provides new insight into phase structures of gauge theories with superfluidity, such as dense QCD.</description>

      <title>HYPERTILING -- a high performance Python library for the generation and visualization of hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HYPERTILING is a high-performance Python library for the generation and visualization of regular hyperbolic lattices embedded in the Poincar\'e disk model. Using highly optimized, efficient algorithms, hyperbolic tilings with millions of vertices can be created in a matter of minutes on a single workstation computer. Facilities including computation of adjacent vertices, dynamic lattice manipulation, refinements, as well as powerful plotting and animation capabilities are provided to support advanced uses of hyperbolic graphs. In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive exploration of the package, encompassing its mathematical foundations, usage examples, applications, and a detailed description of its implementation.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>
