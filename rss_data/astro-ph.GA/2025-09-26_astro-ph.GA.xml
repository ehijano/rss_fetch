      <title>pop-cosmos: Star formation over 12 Gyr from generative modelling of a deep infrared-selected galaxy catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $&lt;26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $&lt;10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0&lt;z&lt;3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($&lt;10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r&gt;0.95$) during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10&lt;\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot})&lt;11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxy halo masses from spectroscopic and photometric lensing in DESI and DES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.</description>

      <title>Massive Star Formation at Supersolar Metallicities: Constraints on the Initial Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals enhance the cooling efficiency of molecular clouds, promoting fragmentation. Consequently, increasing the metallicity may boost the formation of low-mass stars. Within the integrated galaxy initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, this effect is empirically captured by a linear relation between the slope of the low-mass stellar IMF, $\alpha_1$, and the metal mass fraction, $Z$. This linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation has been calibrated up to $\approx 2 \, Z_{\odot}$, though higher metallicity environments are known to exist. We show that if the linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation extends to higher metallicities ($[Z] \gtrsim 0.5$), massive star formation is suppressed entirely. Alternatively, fragmentation efficiency may saturate beyond some metallicity threshold if gravitational collapse cascades rapidly enough. To model this behavior, we propose a logistic function describing the transition from metallicity-sensitive to metallicity-insensitive fragmentation regimes. We provide a user-friendly public code, pyIGIMF, which enables the instantaneous computation of the IGIMF theory with the logistic $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation.</description>

      <title>SAGAbg III: Environmental Stellar Mass Functions, Self-Quenching, and the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation in the Dwarf Galaxy Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts have extended our view of the number and properties of satellite galaxies beyond the Local Group firmly down to $\rm M_\star\sim 10^6 M_\odot$. A similarly complete view of the field dwarf population has lagged behind. Using the background galaxies sample from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey at $z&lt;0.05$, we take inventory of the dwarf population down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$ using three metrics: the stellar mass function (SMF) as function of environment, the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies inferred via abundance matching, and the quenched fraction of highly isolated dwarfs. We find that the low-mass SMF shape shows minimal environmental dependence, with the field dwarf SMF described by a low-mass power-law index of $\alpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$ down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$, and that the quenched fraction of isolated dwarfs drops monotonically to $f_{q} \sim 10^{-3}$ at $\rm M_\star \sim \rm 10^{8.5} M_\odot$. Though slightly steeper than estimates from \HI{} kinematic measures, our inferred SHMR agrees with literature measurements of satellite systems, consistent with minimal environmental dependence of the SHMR in the probed mass range. Finally, although most contemporary cosmological simulations against which we compare accurately predict the \sagalocal{} SHMR, we find that big-box cosmological simulations largely over-predict isolated galaxy quenched fractions via a turnaround in $f_q(\rm M_\star)$ at $\rm 10^8\lesssim M_\star/M_\odot\lesssim 10^9$, underscoring the complexities in disentangling the drivers of galaxy formation and the need for systematic multidimensional observations of the dwarf population across environments.</description>

      <title>Star Formation under a Cosmic Microscope: Highly magnified z = 11 galaxy behind the Bullet Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly discovered spectroscopically confirmed $z=11.10^{+0.11}_{-0.26}$, gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor ${\mu}=14.0^{+6.2}_{-0.3}$. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of $\lesssim 10pc$. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is $0.086^{+0.008}_{-0.030} L^*$ (with $L^*$ being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z&gt;10$ discovered to date.</description>

      <title>A GLIMPSE of Intermediate Mass Black holes in the epoch of reionization: Witnessing the Descendants of Direct Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>On the Fate of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range</description>

      <title>BlackTHUNDER: Shedding light on a dormant and extreme little red dot at z=8.50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, the second most distant LRD known (z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements imply negligible dust attenuation, resulting in a much lower Hbeta-based bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity (~10%) than previously found. Lyman-alpha emission is strongly detected, implying f_esc,Lya~30%. The extremely high [OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (ne~10^7cm-3), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.</description>

      <title>A DECADE of dwarfs: first detection of weak lensing around spectroscopically confirmed low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection of weak gravitational lensing around spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies, using the large overlap between DESI DR1 spectroscopic data and DECADE/DES weak lensing catalogs. A clean dwarf galaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess surface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\log \rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\odot$ and $\log \rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\odot$), with signal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise drops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying individual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber incompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against variations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing calibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with stellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation and find a satellite fraction of $\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous photometric studies but $1.5\sigma$ lower than $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We find that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can change the inferred $f_{\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need for accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our results open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low masses, showing that future massively multiplexed spectroscopic observations and weak lensing data will enable stringent tests of galaxy formation models and $\Lambda$CDM predictions.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Central Dark Mass in NGC 4258 with JWST/NIRSpec Stellar Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central $3'' \times 3''$. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1$\sigma$) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.08^{+0.19}_{-0.33}) \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.</description>

      <title>Under the glare of a luminous quasar, the FIR continuum is still an excellent tracer of the ISM down to the central kiloparsec</title>

Abstract: Contamination-free assessments of the interstellar medium and star formation in quasar host galaxies, particularly based on the far-infrared, offer insights into the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution. Motivated by predictions of quasar heating of dust on both nuclear and galaxy-wide scales, we perform two-component (host galaxy + point source) modeling of high-resolution (~0.1") ALMA observations of the FIR continuum in Band 5 (lambda_rest~500 um) of three highly luminous quasars (L_bol~10^47 erg/s), powered by supermassive black holes having M_BH~10^9 M_sun, at z=2. We include Band 9 (lambda_rest~154 um; 0.06" and 0.3") data at high S/N which places further constraints on the unresolved nuclear component in two cases. To break the degeneracy between quasar and stellar heating, we use CO (J=5-4), observed in Band 5, to gauge the expected contribution of star formation to the infrared luminosity. We find very good agreement between the strength and spatial distribution of the extended continuum component and its prediction based on CO (J=5-4). This is supported by the location of our three quasars along the L_(CO 5-4)-L_(IR, SFR) luminosity relation for inactive star-forming galaxies. As a consequence, there is no evidence for additional continuum emission on extended scales which could be attributed to quasar-heated dust. As expected, the nuclear (i.e., torus) contribution is present and subdominant (12% in Band 9 for one quasar with a typical star-forming host) or non-existent (&lt;8% in Band 9 for the starbursting host). Based on the continuum and CO, the presence of substantial levels of ongoing star formation agrees with previous estimates from unresolved ALMA continuum observations which finds SFRs consistent with star-forming main-sequence galaxies. Therefore, our results do not provide evidence for a quasar-mode feedback, even for the most luminous cases at z=2.</description>

      <title>The X-ray Emission of NGC 5005: An Unobscured Low-Luminosity AGN with a Weakly Accreting Broad-Line Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of NGC 5005, a LINER-dominated galaxy previously reported to host a broad H$\alpha$ emission line. The diffuse soft X-ray emission ($&lt;$3 keV) extends out to $\sim$800 pc, while harder emission ($&gt;$3 keV) is confined to the central $\sim$400 pc. Spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nuclear ($r&lt;150$ pc) and extended ($150&lt;r&lt;500$ pc) regions reveals that these are best described by models including both photoionized and thermal plasma components, consistent with excitation by a low-luminosity AGN and shock-heated gas. Narrow-band imaging and excitation maps from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) support this interpretation, closely matching the X-ray morphology and ionization structure. The detection of a faint hard X-ray nuclear source with Chandra, combined with stringent upper limits from NuSTAR and Swift, and consistency with the X-ray luminosity predicted from the HST [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission, indicates that NGC 5005 hosts an intrinsically low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$), unobscured AGN. Despite the extremely low Eddington ratio inferred from our measurements ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$), the presence of a broad H$\alpha$ line in the optical spectrum suggests the persistence of a thin accretion disk, challenging standard paradigms of accretion flow configurations at such low accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Episodic Feedback in Triple AGN Candidate SDSS J0849+1114 Revealed by Extended ionized gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers funnel gas toward the nuclei, igniting starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN feedback can reshape the host galaxy and regulate both star formation and super-massive black-hole (SMBH) accretion. Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy, we conduct a spatially resolved study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114. Extended ionized gas structures ($&gt;10$ kpc from nucleus A) primarily associated with tidal tails are detected. Meanwhile, two distinct ionized gas outflows are revealed. One extends over $&gt;5$ kpc around nuclei A with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,A} = 3.0\times10^{42}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$, which might be driven by the radio jet. The other outflow extends $\sim 5.9$ kpc around nucleus C, with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,C} = 2.0\times10^{40}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$. High [O III]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tidal gas require that nucleus A radiated at a high accretion rate with $L_{\rm A,bol} \sim 0.1$--$0.5\,L_{\rm Edd,A}$ at least $\sim3$--$\times10^{4}\rm\,yr$ ago, $20$--$100$ times brighter than today. Combined with multi-wavelength constraints, we find evidence for episodic AGN feedback that expelled circumnuclear gas and rapidly quenched accretion. This triple AGN candidate demonstrates how AGN feedback can self-regulate black hole growth and impact hosts during mergers.</description>

      <title>Formation Of Sub-Structure In Luminous Submillimeter galaxies (FOSSILS): Initial sample and the discovery of a dusty spiral at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution far-infrared (FIR) observation of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) is an effective approach to study the formation of sub-structures in the early epoch of massive galaxies. We present the 870$\mu$m continuum images resolved down to sub-kpc scales for 12 SMGs taken by Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) as an initial sample of the FOSSILS Survey. We discovered a wide variety of morphological properties, including a two-arm spiral galaxy at $z=2.5$ possibly induced by a tidal interaction with a minor companion. Nonetheless, about half of the sample exhibit a compact and circular morphology, which is reminiscent of optical morphology of compact quiescent galaxies. Future studies with larger sample and combination of the rest-frame optical images taken by James Webb Space Telescope will shed light on the various evolutionary track of SMGs.</description>

      <title>Tidal features around simulated groups and cluster galaxies: Enhancement and suppression of merger events through environment in LSST-like mock observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generally, merger likelihood increases in denser environments; however, the large relative velocities at the centres of dense clusters are expected to reduce the likelihood of mergers for satellite galaxies. Tidal features probe the recent merger histories of galaxies. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce an unprecedented sample of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use LSST-like mock observations of galaxies at $z\sim0$ from the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG and Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations to predict the occurrence rates of tidal features around satellite galaxies across group and cluster environments in the velocity-radius projected phase-space diagram to investigate the impact of these environments on tidal feature occurrence. We find that ancient infallers in the projected phase-space exhibit a decreasing tidal feature fraction with increasing halo mass, whereas recent infallers in the projected phase-space show unchanging tidal feature fractions with halo mass. Our results show, for the first time in cosmological simulations, a suppression of tidal feature fractions in the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating a reduced merger rate due to higher cluster-centric velocities and lower galaxy total masses in the cluster centres. Using a toy model, we show that the presence of more tidal features in the recent infaller zone and cluster outskirts suggests that tidal features occur in interactions within infalling groups and dissipate by the time they are ancient infallers, indicating a $\lesssim3\pm2$ Gyr survival time of tidal features within clusters.</description>

      <title>Galactic Contrail in NGC 3627 caused by Dwarf Galaxy Candidate or Massive Black Hole Flyby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a kpc scale molecular contrail in the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of 200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6 M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the disk at &gt;300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.</description>

      <title>The Extended Stellar Distribution in the Outskirts of the Ursa Minor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover an extended distribution of main-sequence (MS) stars along the minor axis of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This study is enabled by deep, wide Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data, reaching photometric uncertainties below 0.1 mag at $g,i \sim 26$ mag. Color-magnitude diagrams along the major and minor axes reveal a clear excess of MS stars beyond the nominal tidal radius along the minor axis. To characterize this structure, we derive radial number density profiles in seven azimuthal directions and fit them with an exponential+power-law function to assess the symmetry of the extended component. The power-law slopes tend to be shallower toward the minor axis, though the symmetry remains inconclusive within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties. This may indicate that the extended component is preferentially distributed along the minor axis, and could be different from the previously suggested tidal features along the major axis. Comparing with simulations, we find that the fraction of stars beyond five effective radii is consistent with expectations from an intermediate mass ratio merger scenario with a stellar mass ratio around 6:1. While these findings provide new insights into the structural complexity and dynamical history of the UMi dSph, alternative mechanisms such as stellar or supernova feedback have also been proposed for extended stellar halos in dwarfs and cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoabsorption Spectra of Icy Isoprene and its Oligomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isoprene and its oligomers, terpenes, are expected to be present, along with other complex organic molecules, in the diverse environments of the ISM and in our solar system. Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\alpha$-pinene and $\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene and its oligomers, limonene, $\alpha$-pinene, and $\beta$-pinene. VUV photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its candidature for detection on icy bodies.</description>

      <title>A sample of 3403 galaxy clusters identified in XMM-Newton X-ray images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the number of galaxy clusters identified using galaxy data has far exceeded the number derived from intracluster medium data. In this study, we used positional information from large optical cluster catalogues to search for previously unrecognized X-ray galaxy clusters in archival XMM-Newton data. We successfully identified 1490 galaxy clusters in X-ray images for the first time. By incorporating 1913 previously known X-ray clusters, we constructed a sample of 3403 galaxy clusters observed by XMM-Newton. Our cluster mass estimates show broad consistency with previous measurements. Comparative analyses between the known and newly identified subsamples revealed that new X-ray clusters exhibit systematically higher redshifts, lower masses, and smaller X-ray-to-optical mass ratios, but show no systematic differences in dynamical properties. The newly identified X-ray clusters are a valuable addition to previous X-ray samples and are important for future statistical studies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Central ortho-H2D+ Depletion at Sub-kau Scales in Prestellar Core G205.46-14.56M3: The First Interferometric Evidence and Implications for Deuterium Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prestellar cores represent the initial conditions of star formation, but heavy molecules such as CO are strongly depleted in their cold, dense interiors, limiting the ability to probe core centers. Deuterated molecular ions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is enhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of ortho-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um continuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the previously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central ortho-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\sigma$ contrast and an inferred diameter $\lesssim$600au, together with a peak $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred profiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a deuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+ depletion is only marginally matched within the $2\sigma$ upper limit, likely suggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we infer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that the substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather than slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that ortho-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly thermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few free-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions for both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores.</description>

      <title>RadioSED II: discovering the peaked spectrum radio sources in Stripe 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series presenting \textsc{RadioSED}, a Bayesian inference framework for constructing, modelling and classifying radio spectral energy distributions from publicly-available surveys. We focus here on the application of our framework to SDSS Stripe 82. Not only do we recover all eleven previously-published peaked spectrum sources from the literature within this region, but we increase the number of known peaked spectrum sources here by more than an order of magnitude. We investigate the variability properties of our peaked spectrum sample, and find that overall they exhibit a low degree of variability, consistent with previous samples of peaked spectrum active galactic nuclei. The multiwavelength properties of these sources reveal that we have selected a population comprising largely distant ($z \geq 1$), powerful active galaxies. We find that the most compact jets are located preferentially in quasar-type hosts, with galaxy-type hosts home to slightly more extended radio structures. We discuss these findings in the context of current and forthcoming large area radio surveys.</description>

      <title>Limitations on Morphological Fitting for JWST "Little Red Dots"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early results from JWST uncover a peculiar class of objects referred to as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability of pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies -- to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input parameters for simulated images with SNR $\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\lesssim 50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely high-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock sample fitting. We find that $\sim85\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated, consistent with the AGN-dominated interpretation. The remaining $\sim15\%$ have low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $\gtrsim 150$ pc (Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely compact starbursts.</description>

      <title>Emission line tracers of galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback in simulations of isolated disk galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations can connect outflow observables to the physical conditions of outflowing gas. Here, we use simulations of isolated disk galaxies ranging from dwarf mass ($M_{200} = 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) to Milky Way mass ($M_{200} = 10^{12}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), based on the FIRE-2 subgrid models to investigate multiphase galactic outflows. We use the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry module to create synthetic spectra of common outflow tracers ([CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$, $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, H$\alpha$ and $[\mathrm{OIII}]_{5007\text{A}}$). Using our synthetic spectra we measure the mass outflow rate, kinetic power and momentum flux using observational techniques. In [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ we measure outflow rates of $10^{-4}$ to $1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ across an SFR range of $10^{-3}$ to $1$ $\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is in reasonable agreement with observations. The significant discrepancy is in $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, with the simulations lying $\approx1$ dex below the observational sample. We test observational assumptions used to derive outflow properties from synthetic spectra. We find the greatest uncertainty lies in measurements of electron density, as estimates using the SII doublet can overestimate the actual electron density by up to 2 dex, which changes mass outflow rates by up to 4 dex. We also find that molecular outflows are especially sensitive to the conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass, with outflow rates changing by up to 4 dex in our least massive galaxy. Comparing the outflow properties derived from the synthetic spectra to those derived directly from the simulation, we find that [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ probes outflows at greater distances from the disk, whilst we find that molecular gas does not survive at large distances within outflows within our modestly star-forming disk galaxies simulated in this work.</description>

      <title>The interstellar heritage of comets</title>

Abstract: Comets have similar compositions to interstellar medium ices, suggesting at least some of their molecules maybe inherited from an earlier stage of evolution. To investigate the degree to which this might have occurred we compare the composition of individual comets to that of the well-studied protostellar region IRAS 16293-2422B. We show that the observed molecular abundance ratios in several comets correlate well with those observed in the protostellar source. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cometary abundances are identical to protostellar. We find the abundance ratios of many molecules present in comets are enhanced compared to their protostellar counterparts. For COH-molecules, the data suggest higher abundances relative to methanol of more complex species, e.g. HCOOH, CH3CHO, and HCOOCH3, are found in comets. For N-bearing molecules, the ratio of nitriles relative to CH3CN -- HC3N/CH3CN and HCN/CH3CN -- tend to be enhanced. The abundances of cometary SO and SO2 relative to H2S are enhanced, whereas OCS/H2S is reduced. Using a subset of comets with a common set of observed molecules we suggest a possible means of determining the relative degree to which they retain interstellar ices. This analysis suggests that over 84% of COH-bearing molecules can be explained by the protostellar composition. The possible fraction inherited from the protostellar region is lower for N-molecules at only 26--74%. While this is still speculative, especially since few comets have large numbers of observed molecules, it provides a possible route for determining the relative degree to which comets contain disk-processed material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scope of this literature review is observations of the products of first-stage evolution for binaries having components with M &lt; 2 $M_\odot$. A taxonomy for these products comprises dwarfs ("blue stragglers"), giants ("yellow stragglers"), subdwarf B stars, and giant-like stars ("sub-subgiants" and "red stragglers"). This literature review is organized according to this taxonomy within three distinct environments: open star clusters, globular star clusters, and the Galactic field.
  This literature review is the Supplemental Material for Blue Stragglers and Friends: Initial Evolutionary Pathways in Close Low-Mass Binaries (Mathieu &amp; Pols, 2025, ARAA, 63:467-512, doi: www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-astro-071221-054402). It is intended to support and expand on Section 3 of the main text of this Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where an integrated perspective on the common and contrasting astrophysical properties of these binary evolution products is provided. Figures used in the main text to highlight key observational results are referenced in this literature review.
  The closing date of this review is January 17, 2025, with some citations subsequently updated.</description>

      <title>The SOMA Atomic Outflow Survey. I. An Atomic OI and Highly Ionized OIII Outflow from Massive Protostar G11.94-00.62</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars regulate galaxy evolution and star formation through their powerful physical and chemical feedback, but their formation remains poorly understood. Accretion powered outflows can provide important diagnostics of massive star formation. We present first results from the SOMA Atomic Outflow Survey, a far-infrared massive star formation survey using the FIFI-LS spectrometer on SOFIA. We report detection of [OIII] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ emission at 52 $\mu$m from the massive protostar G11.94-0.62, tracing highly ionized gas. We also detect [OI] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ and $^3P_1\rightarrow^3P_0$ at 63 and 145 $\mu$m tracing atomic gas, as well as CO $J=14\rightarrow13$ at 186 $\mu$m from highly excited molecular gas. The [OIII] and [OI] lines exhibit large line widths ($\sim400$ and $\sim40-80$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively) and their morphologies are consistent with a wide-angle bipolar outflow. Molecular tracers ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) observed with ALMA also suggest a self-consistent outflow morphology. Ionized nebula/PDR modeling imply an ionized outflow mass flux of $\sim8\times10^{-5}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and an atomic outflow mass flux of $\sim5\times10^{-6}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, while the molecular outflow traced by CO has an implied mass flux of $\sim3\times10^{-4}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass and momentum flux in the ionized outflow is consistent with the main component of the primary disk wind, while the molecular component is mainly swept-up, secondary outflow gas. We also observe G11.94-0.62 with the LBT in the near-infrared, potentially tracing the base of wide-angle outflow cavities. SED modeling implies $m_\star = 22.4^{+21}_{-11}\:M_\odot$, while the [OIII] emission implies $m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$ and that the protostar is in the final stages of its accretion.</description>

      <title>Merger-Induced Disturbance and Temporal Signatures in Galaxy Clusters: A Combined Phase Space and Photometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys.
  To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing.
  Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from the eROSITA morphology catalog.</description>

      <title>Exciting Stellar Eccentricity in Gaia BH3 via a Hidden Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.</description>

      <title>Outflow-cloud interaction as the possible origin of the peculiar radio emission in the tidal disruption event AT2018cqh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of &lt;~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~&gt; 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present the Local Volume Database (LVDB), a catalog of the observed properties of dwarf galaxies and star clusters in the Local Group and Local Volume. The LVDB includes positional, structural, kinematic, chemical, and dynamical parameters for dwarf galaxies and star clusters. I discuss the motivation, structure, construction, and future expansion plans of the LVDB. I highlight catalogs on faint and compact ambiguous Milky Way systems, new Milky Way globular clusters and candidates, and globular clusters in nearby dwarf galaxies. The LVDB is complete for known dwarf galaxies within $\sim 3 ~{\rm Mpc}$ and current efforts are underway to expand the database to resolved star systems in the Local Volume. I present publicly available examples and use cases of the LVDB focused on the census and population-level properties of the Local Group and discuss some theoretical avenues. The next decade will be an exciting era for near-field cosmology with many upcoming surveys and facilities, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Euclid mission, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that will both discover new dwarf galaxies and star clusters in the Local Volume and characterize known dwarf galaxies and star clusters in more detail than ever before. The LVDB will be continually updated and is built to support and enable future dwarf galaxy and star cluster research in this data-rich era. The LVDB catalogs and package are publicly available as a GitHub repository, $\texttt{local_volume_database}$, and community use and contributions via GitHub are encouraged.</description>

      <title>Resolved mass assembly and star formation in Milky Way Progenitors since $z = 5$ from JWST/CANUCS: From clumps and mergers to well-ordered disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a resolved study of 877 progenitors of Milky Way Analogs (MWAs) at $0.3&lt;z&lt;5$ selected with abundance matching in the ten fields of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Utilizing 18-21 bands of deep NIRCam, NIRISS, and HST photometry, we create resolved stellar mass maps and star formation rate maps via spectral energy distribution fitting with Dense Basis. We examine their resolved stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) profiles as a function of galactocentric radius, and find clear evidence for inside-out mass assembly. The total $\mstar$ of the inner 2 kpc regions of the progenitors remain roughly constant ($10^{9.3-9.4}\msun$) at $2&lt;z&lt;5$, while the total $\mstar$ of the regions beyond 2 kpc increases by 0.8 dex, from $10^{7.5}\msun$ to $10^{8.3}\msun$. Additionally, the sSFR of the outer regions increase with decreasing redshift, until $z\sim 2$. The median S\'ersic index of the MWA progenitors stays nearly constant at $n \sim 1$ at $2&lt;z&lt;5$, while the half-mass radii of their stellar mass profiles double. We perform additional morphological measurements on the stellar mass maps via the Gini-M20 plane and asymmetry parameters. They show that the rate of double-peak mergers and disturbances to galaxy structure also increase with redshift, with $\sim50\%$ of galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;5$ classified as disturbed, and $\sim20\%$ classified as ongoing mergers. Overall, the early evolution of MWAs is revealed as chaotic, with significant mergers and high SFRs. Mass growth is primarily inside-out and galaxies become more disk-like after $z=3$.</description>

      <title>First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XIX: Supermassive black hole mergers in the early Universe and their environmental dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{\rm seed} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{\rm merger} = 10^{-3.81} (1 + \delta)^{4.78}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{\rm tot}/{\rm M}_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of $0.030~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio ${\rm SNR} \geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Evolution in the Local Universe: Group Richness Effects on Mergers and Non-Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use the luminous volume-limited samples obtained from the twelfth release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and mergers from Galaxy Zoo Project to investigate the influence of group richness in shaping galaxy properties' distributions and their relationships in the local Universe by comparison of mergers and non-mergers. The galaxies were restricted into mass-limited subsamples of low-mass, intermediate-mass and high-mass, assigned into groups from poor to rich group systems, where the distributions of star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (SSFR), spectral index D$_n$ (4000) and $u-r$ colour properties between mergers and non-mergers for all subsamples and their relations with stellar mass of galaxies are compared. The study revealed a significant difference in the distributions between mergers' and non-mergers' properties for low-mass galaxies, while for high-mass galaxies the difference is very weak. For the low-mass sample, mergers possess higher SFR, SSFR than non-mergers when the group richness is kept constant, while for high-mass poor group galaxies have higher SFR, SSFR than rich group galaxies when merging status is kept constant. Mergers resemble young stellar populations and are bluer than non-mergers for low-mass, while for high-mass, mergers and non-mergers have comparable SFR, SSFR, D$_n$ (4000), and $u-r$ colour. The study concludes that group richness and stellar mass influence the mergers' and non-mergers' properties' distributions, and their relationships.</description>

Abstract: Tidal features from galaxy mergers, particularly stellar streams, offer valuable insights into galaxy assembly and dark matter halo properties. This paper aims to identify a large sample of nearby stellar streams suitable for detailed modelling and comparison with simulations to enable population-level constraints on halo properties. We visually inspect and compile a tidal feature catalogue for $19,387$ galaxies with redshift $z \leq 0.02$ from the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 using original, model, and residual images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Residual images, produced by subtracting models of all sources, enhance the detectability of faint asymmetries such as tidal features. We find that $11.9 \pm 0.2\%$ of galaxies host detectable tidal features, more frequently around early-type than late-type galaxies. The tidal feature fraction increases with stellar mass, from $2.4 \pm 0.4\%$ at $\sim10^8$M$_\odot$ to $36.5 \pm 1.2\%$ at $\sim 5\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$. From this, we present the first release of STRRINGS: STReams in Residual Images of Nearby GalaxieS, a subsample of 35 galaxies with long, narrow streams suitable for modelling. We segment these streams and derive their geometry, surface brightness, colours, and stellar masses. The median $g$-band surface brightness is 26.8 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$, reaching 27.5 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$ for the faintest stream. Mass ratios are consistent with minor mergers, and we identify five potential dwarf galaxy progenitors. Our streams are typically longer (median 124 kpc) than the literature, with comparable widths. Stream mass correlates with length and colour, and wider streams lie at larger galactocentric radii. STRRINGS will be expanded and used to constrain halo properties in future work.</description>

      <title>Lithium evolution in the Galactic thin disc from Main-Sequence and early Red-Giant-Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of novae as producers of galactic lithium has been suggested since the 1970s, and it has been reconsidered recently with the detection of $^7$Be in their outbursts. At the same time, stellar models are moving forward to comprehend the discrepancy between the primordial lithium abundance predicted by the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory and the measured value of old dwarf stars. In this work, we follow the evolution of $^7$Li in the galactic thin disc starting from a primordial value of A(Li)=2.69 dex and applying $^7$Li depletion corrections of the stellar model with overshooting to our chemical evolution models. We use the upper envelope of the observational data to constrain the models. In addition to the dwarf main sequence (MS) stars, our analysis includes, for the first time, the early red-giant-branch (RGB) stars. Besides the renowned Spite plateau of the MS stars at low metallicities, we also confirm the existence of a second A(Li) plateau of the early RGB stars, which can be explained by our model with the corrections from stellar models. Our best-fit model is obtained with an effective averaged $^7$Li yield $^{Li}Y_\mathrm{Nova}=2.34\times 10^{-5} M_\odot$ during the whole lifetime of a nova. This reinforces the possibility that novae are the main galactic $^7$Li source, together with the stellar models' ability to comprehend the "cosmological lithium problem" in this context.</description>

      <title>PARSEC V2.0: Rotating tracks and isochrones for seven addtional metallicities in the range Z=0.0001-0.03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PARSEC v2.0 rotating stellar tracks were previously presented for six values of metallicity from subsolar to solar values, with initial rotation rates ($\omega_\mathrm{i}$, defined as the ratio of angular velocity and its critical value) spanning from the non-rotating case to very near the critical velocity (i.e. $\omega_\mathrm{i}=0.99$), and for initial masses covering the $\sim 0.7 M_\odot$ to $14 M_\odot$ interval. Furthermore, we provided the corresponding isochrones converted into several photometric systems, for different inclination angles between the line-of-sight and the rotation axes, from $0^\circ$ (pole-on) to $90^\circ$ (equator-on). In this work, we expand this database with seven other sets of metallicity, including five sets of low metallicity ($Z=0.0001-0.002$) and two sets of super-solar values (up to $Z=0.03$). Here, we present the new stellar tracks, comprising $\sim$3\,040 tracks in total ($\sim$5\,500 including previous sets), along with the new corresponding rotating isochrones. We also introduce the possibility of creating isochrones, by interpolation, for values of rotating rates not available in the initial set of tracks. We compare a selection of our new models with rotating stellar tracks from the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code, and we assess the quality of our new tracks by fitting the colour-magnitude diagram of the open cluster NGC6067. We take advantage of the projected rotational velocity of member stars measured by Gaia to validate our results and examine the surface oxygen abundances in comparison with the observed data. All newly computed stellar tracks and isochrones are retrievable via our dedicated web databases and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shadow of a black hole is critically dependent on the surrounding accreting matter. We investigate the observational signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo under three distinct accretion scenarios: a geometrically thin disk, a static spherical flow, and an infalling spherical flow. For the thin disk model, we find that direct emission dominates the total observed intensity, while the size and brightness of the lensing and photon rings serve as sensitive probes of the Hernquist DM parameters. Under spherical accretion, the Hernquist DM halo significantly enlarges the photon sphere. This results in an observable shadow that is approximately $2\%$ to $30\%$ larger than in the vacuum case, though this increase in size is accompanied by a considerable decrease in overall image brightness. Furthermore, the Doppler de-boosting effect in the infalling scenario produces a markedly darker image than its static counterpart. Our results demonstrate that the size and brightness profile of a black hole shadow provide a powerful observational tool to probe and constrain the distribution of dark matter in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Exact Taub-NUT-like Black Holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity: their thermodynamics and thermodynamic topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-derive an exact analytic three-parameter expressions for the non-rotating metric, describing a Taub-NUT-like black hole (BH), and its associated bumblebee field that are solutions to the Einstein-bumblebee gravity. We construct a consistence thermodynamics for the Taub-NUT-like BH and determine its thermodynamic topological class. The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not affect its thermodynamic topological classification.</description>

      <title>Are X-Ray Detected Active Galactic Nuclei in Dwarf Galaxies Gamma-Ray Bright?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), including both beamed blazars and misaligned-AGN, dominates the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray point-source population count and flux. While multi-wavelength studies have detected an increasing number of AGN within dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, $\gamma$-ray emission has so far only been associated with systems hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Dwarf-galaxy AGN are of particular interest because their central black holes fall in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) regime, offering insight into the early evolution of SMBHs. Using 15~years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data, we present the first search for $\gamma$-ray emission from dwarf-galaxy AGN. In the sample of 74 X-ray-selected dwarf-galaxy AGN, we find no sources that exceed the \textit{Fermi}-LAT detection threshold. However, a joint-likelihood analysis reveals a modest, trials-corrected population-level excess ($\sim2\sigma$) above blank-field expectations at very soft photon indices $\Gamma \gtrsim 3.8$ above 500~MeV. This hint is most pronounced when source contributions are weighed by $M^\alpha_{{\rm IMBH},i}/d_i^2$, with $\alpha\simeq1$--$1.5$, suggesting -- but not confirming -- that $\gamma$-ray emission could scale with the central black hole mass or a property correlated with it (e.g., accretion rate), but with a markedly softer spectrum than in SMBH-hosted AGN.</description>
