      <title>Loop-Diffusion: an equivariant diffusion model for designing and scoring protein loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting protein functional characteristics from structure remains a central problem in protein science, with broad implications from understanding the mechanisms of disease to designing novel therapeutics. Unfortunately, current machine learning methods are limited by scarce and biased experimental data, and physics-based methods are either too slow to be useful, or too simplified to be accurate. In this work, we present Loop-Diffusion, an energy based diffusion model which leverages a dataset of general protein loops from the entire protein universe to learn an energy function that generalizes to functional prediction tasks. We evaluate Loop-Diffusion's performance on scoring TCR-pMHC interfaces and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in recognizing binding-enhancing mutations.</description>

      <title>Osmotically-induced rupture of viral capsids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple model is proposed aimed to investigate how the amount of dissociated ions influences the mechanical stability of viral capsids. After an osmotic and mechanical equilibrium is established with the outer solution, a non-adiabatic change in salt concentration at the external environment is considered, which results in a significant solvent inflow across the capsid surface, eventually leading to its rupture. The key assumption behind such an osmotic shock mechanism is that solvent flow takes place at timescales much shorter than the ones typical of ionic diffusion. In order to theoretically describe this effect, we herein propose a thermodynamic model based on the traditional Flory theory. The proposed approach is further combined with a continuum Hookian elastic model of surface stretching and pore-opening along the lines of a Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT), allowing us to establish the conditions under which capsid mechanical instability takes place. Despite its non-local character, the proposed model is able to capture most of the relevant physical mechanisms controlling capsid stability, namely the volume exclusion and entropy of mixing effects among the densely-packed components, the elastic cost for capsid stretching and further pore opening, the Donnan equilibrium across the interface, as well as the large entropy loss resulting from folding the viral genome into close-packed configurations inside the capsid. It is shown that, depending on the particular combination of initial condition and capsid surface strength, the capsid can either become unstable after removal of a prescribed amount of external salt, or be fully stable against osmotic shock, regardless of the amount of ionic dilution.</description>

      <title>Chirality Modulated Accumulation of Chiral Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed motion up a concentration gradient is crucial for the survival and maintenance of numerous biological systems, such as sperms moving towards an egg during fertilization or ciliates moving towards a food source. In these systems, chirality - manifested as a rotational torque - plays a vital role in facilitating directed motion. While systematic studies of active molecules in activity gradients exist, the effect of chirality remains little studied. In this study, we examine the simplest case of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle in a spatially varying activity field. We demonstrate that this minimal setup can exhibit rich emergent tactic behaviors, with the chiral torque serving as the tuning parameter. Notably, when the chiral torque is sufficiently large, even a small passive particle enables the system to display the desired accumulation behavior. This study provides valuable insights into the design principles of hybrid bio-molecular devices of the future.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to statistical equilibrium in stochastic Michaelis-Menten kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equilibration of enzyme and complex concentrations in deterministic Michaelis-Menten reaction networks underlies the hyperbolic dependence between the input (substrates) and output (products). This relationship was first obtained by Michaelis and Menten and then Briggs and Haldane in two asymptotic limits: `fast equilibrium' and `steady state'. In stochastic Michaelis-Menten networks, relevant to catalysis at single-molecule and mesoscopic concentrations, the classical analysis cannot be directly applied due to molecular discreteness and fluctuations. Instead, as we show here, such networks require a more subtle asymptotic analysis based on the decomposition of the network into reversible and irreversible sub-networks and the exact solution of the chemical master equation (CME). The reversible and irreversible sub-networks reach detailed balance and stationarity, respectively, through a relaxation phase that we characterise in detail through several new statistical measures. Since stochastic enzyme kinetics encompasses the single-molecule, mesoscopic and thermodynamic limits, our work provides a broader molecular viewpoint of the classical results, in much the same manner that statistical mechanics provides a broader understanding of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Furutsu-Novikov--like cross-correlation--response relations for systems driven by shot noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic system that is driven by an intensity-modulated Poisson process with intensity $\Lambda(t)=\lambda(t)+\varepsilon\nu(t)$. We derive an exact relation between the input-output cross-correlation in the spontaneous state ($\varepsilon=0$) and the linear response to the modulation ($\varepsilon&gt;0$). If $\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small, linear response theory captures the full response. The relation can be regarded as a variant of the Furutsu-Novikov theorem for the case of shot noise. As we show, the relation is still valid in the presence of additional independent noise. Furthermore, we derive an extension to Cox-process input, which provides an instance of colored shot noise. We discuss applications to particle detection and to neuroscience. Using the new relation, we obtain a fluctuation-response-relation for a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. We also show how the new relation can be used in a remote control problem in a recurrent neural network. The relations are numerically tested for both stationary and non-stationary dynamics. Lastly, extensions to marked Poisson processes and to higher-order statistics are presented.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
