      <title>Term rewriting on nestohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define term rewriting systems on the vertices and faces of nestohedra, and show that the former are confluent and terminating. While the associated poset on vertices generalizes Barnard--McConville's flip order for graph-associahedra, the preorder on faces likely generalizes the facial weak order for permutahedra. Moreover, we define and study contextual families of nestohedra, whose local confluence diagrams satisfy a certain uniformity condition. Among them are associahedra and operahedra, whose associated proofs of confluence for their rewriting systems reproduce proofs of categorical coherence theorems for monoidal categories and categorified operads.</description>

      <title>Applied Category Theory in the Wolfram Language using Categorica I: Diagrams, Functors and Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article serves as a preliminary introduction to the design of a new, open-source applied and computational category theory framework, named Categorica, built on top of the Wolfram Language. Categorica allows one to configure and manipulate abstract quivers, categories, groupoids, diagrams, functors and natural transformations, and to perform a vast array of automated abstract algebraic computations using (arbitrary combinations of) the above structures; to manipulate and abstractly reason about arbitrary universal properties, including products, coproducts, pullbacks, pushouts, limits and colimits; and to manipulate, visualize and compute with strict (symmetric) monoidal categories, including full support for automated string diagram rewriting and diagrammatic theorem-proving. In so doing, Categorica combines the capabilities of an abstract computer algebra framework (thus allowing one to compute directly with epimorphisms, monomorphisms, retractions, sections, spans, cospans, fibrations, etc.) with those of a powerful automated theorem-proving system (thus allowing one to convert universal properties and other abstract constructions into (higher-order) equational logic statements that can be reasoned about and proved using standard automated theorem-proving methods, as well as to prove category-theoretic statements directly using purely diagrammatic methods). In this first of two articles introducing the design of the framework, we shall focus principally upon its handling of quivers, categories, diagrams, groupoids, functors and natural transformations, including demonstrations of both its algebraic manipulation and theorem-proving capabilities in each case.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>Regular categories, oligomorphic monoids, and tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knop constructed a tensor category associated to a finitely-powered regular category equipped with a degree function. In recent work with Harman, we constructed a tensor category associated to an oligomorphic group equipped with a measure. In this paper, we explain how Knop's approach fits into our theory. The first, and most important, step describes finitely-powered regular categories in terms of oligomorphic monoids; this may be of independent interest. We go on to examine some aspects of this construction when the regular category one starts with is the category of $G$-sets for an oligomorphic group $G$, which yields some interesting examples.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Premonoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Premonoidal categories are monoidal categories without the interchange law; effectful categories are premonoidal categories with a chosen monoidal subcategory of interchanging morphisms. In the same sense that string diagrams, pioneered by Joyal and Street, are an internal language for monoidal categories, we show that string diagrams with an added 'runtime wire', pioneered by Alan Jeffrey, are an internal language for effectful categories and can be used as string diagrams for effectful, premonoidal and Freyd categories.</description>

      <title>Automata and coalgebras in categories of species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalized automata (in the sense of Ad\'amek-Trnkov\'a) in Joyal's category of (set-valued) combinatorial species, and as an important preliminary step, we study coalgebras for its derivative endofunctor $\partial$ and for the `Euler homogeneity operator' $L\circ\partial$ arising from the adjunction $L\dashv\partial\dashv R$.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>

      <title>Localization theorems for approximable triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximable triangulated categories, as introduced and developed by Neeman, provide a solid framework for studying localization sequences within triangulated categories. In our paper, we demonstrate that a recollement of approximable triangulated categories, given certain mild conditions, induces short exact sequences of both triangulated subcategories and Verdier quotient categories. Specifically, in the case of a recollement of locally Hom-finite noetherian approximable triangulated categories, we find that this induces a short exact sequence of the bounded closures of compact objects within these categories. Furthermore, if the recollement extends one step downwards, it yields a short exact sequence of the singularity categories of these triangulated categories, offering a generalization of the localization sequence established by Jin-Yang-Zhou for the singularity categories of finite-dimensional algebras. We also present applications of these results within the derived categories of finite-dimensional algebras, DG algebras, and schemes.</description>
