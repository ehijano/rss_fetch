      <title>Towards a Unified Theoretical Framework for Self-Supervised MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-resolution, non-invasive imaging continues to drive innovation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yet prolonged acquisition times hinder accessibility and real-time applications. While deep learning-based reconstruction methods have accelerated MRI, their predominant supervised paradigm depends on fully-sampled reference data that are challenging to acquire. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have emerged as promising alternatives, but most are empirically designed and fragmented. Therefore, we introduce UNITS (Unified Theory for Self-supervision), a general framework for self-supervised MRI reconstruction. UNITS unifies prior SSL strategies within a common formalism, enabling consistent interpretation and systematic benchmarking. We prove that SSL can achieve the same expected performance as supervised learning. Under this theoretical guarantee, we introduce sampling stochasticity and flexible data utilization, which improve network generalization under out-of-domain distributions and stabilize training. Together, these contributions establish UNITS as a theoretical foundation and a practical paradigm for interpretable, generalizable, and clinically applicable self-supervised MRI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Scalable neural pushbroom architectures for real-time denoising of hyperspectral images onboard satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of Earth observation satellites will seek to deploy intelligent models directly onboard the payload in order to minimize the latency incurred by the transmission and processing chain of the ground segment, for time-critical applications. Designing neural architectures for onboard execution, particularly for satellite-based hyperspectral imagers, poses novel challenges due to the unique constraints of this environment and imaging system that are largely unexplored by the traditional computer vision literature. In this paper, we show that this setting requires addressing three competing objectives, namely high-quality inference with low complexity, dynamic power scalability and fault tolerance. We focus on the problem of hyperspectral image denoising, which is a critical task to enable effective downstream inference, and highlights the constraints of the onboard processing scenario. We propose a neural network design that addresses the three aforementioned objectives with several novel contributions. In particular, we propose a mixture of denoisers that can be resilient to radiation-induced faults as well as allowing for time-varying power scaling. Moreover, each denoiser employs an innovative architecture where an image is processed line-by-line in a causal way, with a memory of past lines, in order to match the acquisition process of pushbroom hyperspectral sensors and greatly limit memory requirements. We show that the proposed architecture can run in real-time, i.e., process one line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware and provide competitive denoising quality with respect to significantly more complex state-of-the-art models. We also show that the power scalability and fault tolerance objectives provide a design space with multiple tradeoffs between those properties and denoising quality.</description>

      <title>Spacecube: A fast inverse hyperspectral georectification system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral cameras provide numerous advantages in terms of the utility of the data captured. They capture hundreds of data points per sample (pixel) instead of only the few of RGB or multispectral camera systems. Aerial systems sense such data remotely, but the data must be georectified to produce consistent images before analysis. We find the traditional direct georectification method to be slow, and it is prone to artifacts. To address its downsides, we propose Spacecube, a program that implements a complete hyperspectral georectification pipeline, including our own fast inverse georectification technique, using OpenGL graphics programming technologies. Spacecube operates substantially faster than real-time and eliminates pixel coverage artifacts. It facilitates high quality interactive viewing, data exploration, and export of final products. We release Spacecube's source code publicly for the community to use.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning: A new frontier in the exploration of multi-institutional medical imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed the perspective of medical imaging, leading to a genuine technological revolution in modern computer-assisted healthcare systems. However, ubiquitously featured deep learning (DL) systems require access to a considerable amount of data, facilitating proper knowledge extraction and generalization. Access to such extensive resources may be hindered due to the time and effort required to convey ethical agreements, set up and carry the acquisition procedures through, and manage the datasets adequately with a particular emphasis on proper anonymization. One of the pivotal challenges in the DL field is data integration from various sources acquired using different hardware vendors, diverse acquisition protocols, experimental setups, and even inter-operator variabilities. In this paper, we review the federated learning (FL) concept that fosters the integration of large-scale heterogeneous datasets from multiple institutions in training DL models. In contrast to a centralized approach, the decentralized FL procedure promotes training DL models while preserving data privacy at each institution involved. We formulate the FL principle and comprehensively review general and specialized medical imaging aggregation and learning algorithms, enabling the generation of a globally generalized model. We meticulously go through the challenges in constructing FL-based systems, such as data and model heterogeneities across the institutions, resilience to potential attacks on data privacy, and the variability in computational and communication resources among the entangled sites that might induce efficiency issues of the entire system. Finally, we explore the up-to-date open frameworks for rapid FL-based algorithm prototyping, comprehensively present real-world implementations of FL systems and shed light on future directions in this intensively growing field.</description>

      <title>DermaCon-IN: A Multi-concept Annotated Dermatological Image Dataset of Indian Skin Disorders for Clinical AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising 5,450 clinical images from 3,002 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with 245 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, aetiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures, including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Clinical Text and Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, nonmedical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM pipeline centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.070. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% and outperforms classifiers trained on images generated by prior state-of-the-art. Classifier training solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to real image training. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric pipeline enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Binarization Methods For Medical Image Hashing On Odir Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluated four binarization methods. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Iterative Quantization (ITQ), Kernel-based Supervised Hashing (KSH), and Supervised Discrete Hashing (SDH) on the ODIR dataset using deep feature embeddings. Experimental results show that SDH achieved the best performance, with an mAP@100 of 0.9184 using only 32-bit codes, outperforming LSH, ITQ, and KSH. Compared with prior studies, our method proved highly competitive: Fang et al. reported 0.7528 (Fundus-iSee, 48 bits) and 0.8856 (ASOCT-Cataract, 48 bits), while Wijesinghe et al. achieved 94.01 (KVASIR, 256 bits). Despite using significantly fewer bits, our SDH-based framework reached retrieval accuracy close to the state-of-the-art. These findings demonstrate that SDH is the most effective approach among those tested, offering a practical balance of accuracy, storage, and efficiency for medical image retrieval and device inventory management.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Hadamard Network: A Novel Defense Against Adversarial Attacks with a New Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adverse-weather image restoration (e.g., rain, snow, haze) models remain highly vulnerable to gradient-based white-box adversarial attacks, wherein minimal loss-aligned perturbations cause substantial degradation in the restored output. This paper presents QHNet, a computationally efficient purification-based defense that precedes the restoration network and targets perturbation suppression in the transform and quaternion domains. QHNet incorporates a Quaternion Hadamard Polynomial Denoising Block (QHPDB) and a Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB) within an encoder-decoder framework to remove high-frequency adversarial noise while preserving fine structural details. Robustness is evaluated using PSNR and SSIM across rain, snow, and haze removal tasks, and further validated under adaptive, defense-aware white-box attacks employing Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA), and Expectation Over Transformation (EOT). Experimental results demonstrate that QHNet delivers superior restoration fidelity and significantly improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art purification baselines, confirming its effectiveness for low-level vision pipelines.</description>

      <title>QUIET-SR: Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Single Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using deep learning have significantly improved image restoration quality. However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. Our efficient batching strategy directly enables massive parallelization on multiple QPU's paving the way for practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution through coordinated QPU-GPU quantum supercomputing.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Lens Active Alignment with Unlabeled Data via Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.</description>
