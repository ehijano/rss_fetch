      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions of a degenerate diffusion equation with a multistable reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalized degenerate diffusion equation with a reaction term $u_t=[A(u)]_{xx}+f(u)$, where $A$ is a smooth function satisfying $A(0)=A'(0)=0$ and $A(u),\ A'(u),\ A''(u)&gt;0$ for $u&gt;0$, $f$ is of monostable type in $[0,s_1]$ and of bistable type in $[s_1,1]$. We first give a trichotomy result on the asymptotic behavior of the solutions starting at compactly supported initial data, which says that, as $t\to \infty$, either small-spreading (which means $u$ tends to $s_1$), or transition, or big-spreading (which means $u$ tends to $1$) happens for a solution. Then we construct the classical and sharp traveling waves (a sharp wave means a wave having a free boundary which satisfies the Darcy's law) for the generalized degenerate diffusion equation, and then using them to characterize the spreading solution near its front.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ decay estimates of weak solutions to 3D fractional MHD equations in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional MHD equations in exterior domains have not been studied in earlier literature. In this paper, $L^2$ properties of weak solutions to the 3D exterior fractional MHD equations is provided and $L^2$ decay estimates of the weak solutions are obtained. The MHD equations becomes the Navier-Stokes equations when magnetic field is not involved in the fluid motion problem. Therefore the corresponding result for the 3D exterior fractional Navier-Stokes equations remains true.</description>

      <title>Improved quasi-invariance result for the periodic Benjamin-Ono-BBM equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend recent results of Genovese-Luca-Tzvetkov (2022) regarding the quasi-invariance of Gaussian measures under the flow of the periodic Benjamin-Ono-BBM (BO-BBM) equation to the full range where BO-BBM is globally well-posed. The main difficulty is due to the critical nature of the dispersion which we overcome by combining the approach of Coe-Tolomeo (2024) with an iteration argument due to Forlano-Tolomeo (2024) to obtain long-time higher integrability bounds on the transported density.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion systems from kinetic models for bacterial communities on a leaf surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many mathematical models for biological phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, are based on reaction-diffusion equations for densities of interacting cell populations. We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface. Turing instability properties of the relevant macroscopic systems are investigated by analytical methods and numerical tools, with particular emphasis on pattern formation for varying parameters in two-dimensional space domains.</description>

      <title>H\"older stability estimates for the determination of time-independent potentials in a relativistic wave equation in an infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to establish H\"older stability estimates for the Calder\'on problem related to a relativistic wave equation. The principal novelty of this article is that the partial differential equation (PDE) under consideration depends on three unknown potentials, namely a temporal dissipative potential $A_0$, a spatial vector potential $A$ and an external potential $\Phi$. Moreover, the PDE is posed in an infinite waveguide geometry $\Omega=\omega\times\mathbb{R}$ and not on a bounded domain. For our proof it is essential that the potentials are time-independent as a key tool in this work are pointwise estimates for the Radon transform of the vector potential $\mathcal{A}=(A_0,\mathrm{i} A)$ and external potential $\Phi$. Furthermore, the demonstrated stability estimates hold for a wide range of $H^s$ Sobolev scales and a main contribution is to explicitly determine the dependence of the involved constants and the H\"older exponent on the Sobolev exponents of the potentials $A_0,A$ and $\Phi$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Dirac-harmonic maps from a compact surface with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a commutative version of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model, Dirac-harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces were introduced fifteen years ago. They are critical points of an unbounded conformally invariant functional involving two fields, a map from a Riemann surface into a Riemannian manifold and a section of a Dirac bundle which is the usual spinor bundle twisted with the pull-back of the tangent bundle of the target by the map. As solutions to a coupled nonlinear elliptic system, the existence and regularity theory of Dirac-harmonic maps has already received much attention, while the general uniqueness theory has not been established yet. For uncoupled Dirac-harmonic maps, the map components are harmonic maps. Since the uniqueness theory of harmonic maps from a compact surface with boundary is known, it is sufficient to consider the uniqueness of the spinor components, which are solutions to the corresponding boundary value problems for a nonlinear Dirac equation. In particular, when the map components belong to $W^{1,p}$ with $p&gt;2$, the spinor components are uniquely determined by boundary values and map components. For coupled Dirac-harmonic maps, the map components are not harmonic maps. So the uniqueness problem is more difficult to solve. In this paper, we study the uniqueness problem on a compact surface with boundary. More precisely, we prove the energy convexity for weakly Dirac-harmonic maps from the unit disk with small energy. This yields the first uniqueness result about Dirac-harmonic maps from a surface conformal to the unit disk with small energy and arbitrary boundary values.</description>

      <title>The moving contact line problem for the $2D$ nonlinear shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problem for a nonlinear shallow water model in horizontal dimension d = 2 and in the presence of a fixed partially immersed solid body on the water surface. We assume that the bottom of the solid body is the graph of a smooth function and part of it is in contact with the water. As a result, we have a contact line where the solid body, the water, and the air meet. In our setting of the problem, the projection of the contact line on the horizontal plane moves freely due to the motion of the water surface even if the solid body is fixed. This wave-structure interaction problem reduces to an initial boundary value problem for the nonlinear shallow water equations in an exterior domain with a free boundary, which is the projection of the contact line. The objective of this paper is to derive a priori energy estimates locally in time for solutions at the quasilinear regularity threshold under assumptions that the initial flow is irrotational and subcritical and that the initial water surface is transversal to the bottom of the solid body at the contact line. The key ingredients of the proof are the weak dissipativity of the system, the introduction of second order Alinhac good unknowns associated with a regularizing diffeomorphism, and a new type of hidden boundary regularity for the nonlinear shallow water equations. This last point is crucial to control the regularity of the contact line; it is obtained by combining the use of the characteristic fields related to the eigenvalues of the boundary matrix together with Rellich type identities.</description>

Abstract: This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview on enhanced dissipation phenomena, transitioning seamlessly from the physical principles underlying the interplay between advection and diffusion to their rigorous mathematical formulation and analysis.

      <title>Interface conditions for Maxwell's equations by homogenization of thin inclusions: transmission, reflection or polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell equations in a complex geometry. We are interested in geometries that model polarization filters or Faraday cages. We study the situation that the underlying domain contains perfectly conducting inclusions, the inclusions are distributed in a periodic fashion along a surface. The periodicity is $\eta&gt;0$ and the typical scale of the inclusion is $\eta$, but we allow also the presence of even smaller scales, e.g. when thin wires are analyzed. We are interested in the limit $\eta\to 0$ and in effective equations. Depending on geometric properties of the inclusions, the effective system can imply perfect transmission, perfect reflection or polarization.</description>

      <title>On the stability of viscous three-dimensional rotating Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of Couette flow in the 3d Navier-Stokes equations with rotation, as given by the Coriolis force. Hereby, the nature of linearized dynamics near Couette flow depends crucially on the force balance between background shearing and rotation, and includes lift-up or exponential instabilities, as well as a stable regime. In the latter, shearing resp. rotational inertial waves give rise to mixing and dispersive effects, which are relevant for distinct dynamical realms. Our main result quantifies these effects through enhanced dissipation and dispersive amplitude decay in both linear and nonlinear settings: in particular, we establish a nonlinear transition threshold which quantitatively improves over the setting without rotation (and increases further with rotation speed), showcasing its stabilizing effect.</description>

      <title>The simplest solutions of cold plasma equations: change in properties from a hydrodynamic to a kinetic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the transition from the kinetic model of Landau cold plasma to the hydrodynamic one by constructing a "multi-speed" moment chain in the case of one spatial variable. Closing this chain at the first step leads to the standard hydrodynamic system of cold plasma. The change in the properties of the solution when closing the chain at the second step is discussed using the example of two classes of solutions - affine in space and traveling waves, and it is shown that their properties change significantly compared to the hydrodynamic model.</description>

Abstract: A maximal realisation of the two-dimensional Pauli operator, subject to Aharonov--Bohm magnetic field, is investigated. Contrary to the case of the Pauli operator with regular magnetic potentials, it is shown that both components of the Pauli operator are critical. Asymptotics of the weakly coupled eigenvalues, generated by electric (not necessarily self-adjoint) perturbations, are derived.</description>

      <title>Stiff Transfer Learning for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff differential equations are prevalent in various scientific domains, posing significant challenges due to the disparate time scales of their components. As computational power grows, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have led to significant improvements in modeling physical processes described by differential equations. Despite their promising outcomes, vanilla PINNs face limitations when dealing with stiff systems, known as failure modes. In response, we propose a novel approach, stiff transfer learning for physics-informed neural networks (STL-PINNs), to effectively tackle stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Our methodology involves training a Multi-Head-PINN in a low-stiff regime, and obtaining the final solution in a high stiff regime by transfer learning. This addresses the failure modes related to stiffness in PINNs while maintaining computational efficiency by computing "one-shot" solutions. The proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy and speed compared to PINNs-based methods, as well as comparable computational efficiency with implicit numerical methods in solving stiff-parameterized linear and polynomial nonlinear ODEs and PDEs under stiff conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of such an approach and the superior speed it offers for simulations involving initial conditions and forcing function reparametrization.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Schr\"odinger operators with supercritical killing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta-V$, where $V$ is a supercritical non-negative potential belonging to a large class of functions containing functions of the form $b|x|^{-(2+2\beta)}$, $b, \beta&gt;0$. We obtain two-sided estimates on the heat kernel $p(t, x, y)$ of $\Delta-V$, along with estimates for the corresponding Green function. Unlike the case of the fractional Schr\"odinger operator $-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}-V$, $\alpha\in (0, 2)$, with supercritical killing potential dealt with in [11], in the present case, the heat kernel $p(t, x, y)$ decays to 0 exponentially as $x$ or $y$ tends to the origin.</description>

      <title>Self-improving properties of weighted norm inequalities on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses self-improving properties of the Muckenhoupt condition and weighted norm inequalities for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function on metric measure spaces with a doubling measure. Our main result provides direct proofs of these properties by applying a Whitney covering argument and a technique inspired by the Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition. In particular, this approach does not rely on reverse H\"older inequalities.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability of Fractional Evolution Equations with Nonlocal Conditions via Operator Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions, as well as the approximate controllability, of a class of fractional evolution equations with nonlocal conditions in Hilbert spaces. Sufficient conditions for approximate controllability are established through a novel approach to the approximate solvability of semilinear operator equations. The methodology utilizes Green's function and constructs a control function based on the Gramian controllability operator. The analysis is based on Schauder's fixed point theorem and the theory of fractional order solution operators and resolvent operators. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed theoretical results, an illustrative example is provided.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for fractional $\Phi^3_d$ on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the fractional $\Phi^3_d$-measure on the $d$-dimensional torus, with Gaussian free field having inverse covariance $(1-\Delta)^\alpha$, and show a phase transition at $d=3\alpha$. More precisely, in a regular regime $d&lt;3\alpha$, one can construct and normalise this measure, and obtain a measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian free field $\mu$. At $d=3\alpha$, the behaviour depends on the size $|\sigma|$ of the nonlinearity: for $|\sigma|\ll1$, the measure exists, but is singular with respect to $\mu$, whereas for $|\sigma|\gg1$, the measure is not normalisable. This generalises a result of Oh, Okamoto, and Tolomeo (2025) on the $\Phi^3_3$-measure.</description>

      <title>Non relativistic limit of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: Uniform in time convergence of KAM solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non relativistic limit of the solutions of the cubic nonlinear Klein--Gordon (KG) equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct a family of quasi periodic solutions which, after a Gauge transformation, converge globally uniformly in time to quasi periodic solutions of the cubic NLS. The proof is based on KAM theory. We emphasize that, regardless of the spatial domain, all the previous results prove the convergence of KG solutions to NLS solutions only on compact time intervals.</description>

      <title>Corrector estimates and homogenization errors of unsteady flow ruled by Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on Darcy's law incorporating memory effects, this paper studies non-stationary Stokes equations on perforated domains. We establish a sharp homogenization error for both velocity and pressure in terms of the energy norm. The main challenge lies in gauging the boundary layers induced by the incompressibility condition. To address this, we construct boundary-layer correctors using Bogovskii's operator. Also, the present work provides detailed regularity estimates for these correctors, where a significant difficulty arises from the incompatibility between initial and boundary values. The methodologies developed herein hold great potential for tackling the same issue in other evolutionary models beyond a homogenization setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^3$ and a rigid body $\mathcal{S}(t)\subset\Omega$ moving inside a viscous compressible Newtonian fluid. We exploit the roughness of the body to show that the solid collides its container in finite time. We investigate the case when the boundary of the body is of $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity and show that collision can happen for some suitable range of $\alpha$. We also discuss some no-collision results for the smooth body case.</description>

      <title>Free energy minimizers with radial densities: classification and quantitative stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the isoperimetric problem with a potential energy $g$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ weighted by a radial density $f$ and analyze the geometric properties of minimizers. Notably, we construct two counterexamples demonstrating that, in contrast to the classical isoperimetric case $g = 0$, the condition $\ln(f)'' + g' \geq 0$ does not generally guarantee the global optimality of centered spheres. However, we demonstrate that centered spheres are globally optimal when both $f$ and $g$ are monotone. Additionally, we strengthen this result by deriving a sharp quantitative stability inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and infinite-speed propagation of solutions to models arising in porous media, when the mobility is highly degenerate (inverse power law). The approach is based on maximum principles for the fractional Laplacian, and allows to derive lower bounds on solutions in a straightforward manner. Finally, in the case of clogged porous media, where the mobility vanishes at points of unbounded density, solutions that become instantaneously bounded are constructed.</description>

      <title>Stroke classification using Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection from in silico electrical impedance tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method for recovering the internal conductivity of a physical body from electric boundary measurements. EIT combined with machine learning has shown promise for the classification of strokes. However, most previous works have used raw EIT voltage data as network inputs. We build upon a recent development which suggested the use of special noise-robust Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED) functions as network inputs, although that work used only highly simplified and mathematically ideal models. In this work we strengthen the case for the use of EIT, and VHED functions especially, for stroke classification. We design models with high detail and mathematical realism to test the use of VHED functions as inputs. Virtual patients are created using a physically detailed 2D head model which includes features known to create challenges in real-world imaging scenarios. Conductivity values are drawn from statistically realistic distributions, and phantoms are afflicted with either hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes of various shapes and sizes. Simulated noisy EIT electrode data, generated using the realistic Complete Electrode Model (CEM) as opposed to the mathematically ideal continuum model, is processed to obtain VHED functions. We compare the use of VHED functions as inputs against the alternative paradigm of using raw EIT voltages. Our results show that (i) stroke classification can be performed with high accuracy using 2D EIT data from physically detailed and mathematically realistic models, and (ii) in the presence of noise, VHED functions outperform raw data as network inputs.</description>

      <title>Small-time approximate controllability of bilinear Schr\"odinger equations and diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger PDEs, posed on a boundaryless Riemannian manifold $M$, with bilinear control. We propose a new method to prove the global $L^2$-approximate controllability. Contrarily to previous ones, it works in arbitrarily small time and does not require a discrete spectrum.
  This approach consists in controlling separately the radial part and the angular part of the wavefunction thanks to the control of the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ of diffeomorphisms of $M$ and the control of phases, which refer to the possibility, for any initial state $\psi_0\in L^2(M,\mathbb{C})$, diffeomorphism $P\in {\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ and phase $\varphi \in L^2(M,\mathbb{R})$ to reach approximately the states $(\det DP)^{1/2}(\psi_0\circ P)$ and $e^{i \varphi}\psi_0 $. The control of the radial part uses the transitivity of the group action of ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ on positive densities proved by Moser.
  We develop this approach on two examples of Schr\"odinger equations, posed on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$, for which the small-time control of phases was recently proved. We prove that it implies the small-time control of flows of vector fields thanks to Lie bracket techniques. Combining this property with the simplicity of the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$ proved by Thurston, we obtain the control of the group ${\rm Diff}_c^0(M)$.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of nondegenerate hypo-analytic structures of hypersurface type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a smooth, non-degenerate locally integrable structure of hypersurface type on a manifold $M$, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be equivalent, near a point, to a real-analytic locally integrable structure (the analytic regularizability), generalizing a recent result of Zaitsev and the first author.
  First, we discover, in our setting, a (previously unknown) invariant CR submanifold $\Sigma$ in $M$ of hypersurface type, which we call the central submanifold. We prove that the analytic regularizability of $M$ is equivalent to that of the associated CR manifold $\Sigma$. Furthermore, as a byproduct of our construction, we show that the central manifold construction reduces the whole (smooth or analytic) equivalence problem for nondegenerate structures with the Levi positivity condition to that of the associated central manifolds, i.e. to CR geometry.
  Second, we make use of a classical construction due to Marson and show that sufficient for the analytic regularizability of $M$ is the analytic regularizability of the CR manifold $\tilde M$ associated with $M$ in the sense of Marson.
  We show applications of both regularizability conditions to classes of locally integrable structures.</description>
