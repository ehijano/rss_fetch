      <title>Applications of dimension interpolation to orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimension interpolation is a novel programme of research which attempts to unify the study of fractal dimension by considering various spectra which live in between well-studied notions of dimension such as Hausdorff, box, Assouad and Fourier dimension. These spectra often reveal novel features not witnessed by the individual notions and this information has applications in many directions. In this survey article, we discuss dimension interpolation broadly and then focus on applications to the dimension theory of orthogonal projections. We focus on three distinct applications coming from three different dimension spectra, namely, the Fourier spectrum, the intermediate dimensions, and the Assouad spectrum. The celebrated Marstrand--Mattila projection theorem gives the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of a Borel set in Euclidean space for almost all orthogonal projections. This result has inspired much further research on the dimension theory of projections including the consideration of dimensions other than the Hausdorff dimension, and the study of the exceptional set in the Marstrand--Mattila theorem.</description>

      <title>Projections of self-affine fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Falconer's 1988 landmark result on the dimensions of self-affine fractals to encompass the dimensions of their projections, showing furthermore that their families of exceptional projections contain algebraic varieties which are preserved by the underlying linear algebraic group. The techniques which we develop allow us to construct examples of additional new phenomena: firstly, we give general examples of equilibrium measures on self-affine fractals which admit non-exact-dimensional projections. Secondly, we construct strongly irreducible self-affine sets which have small sumsets without any arithmetic resonance in their construction.</description>

      <title>Ideal quantum metrics from fractional Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for Monge--Kantorovi\v{c} metrics using Schatten ideals and commutators of fractional Laplacians on Ahlfors regular spaces. Notably, for those metrics we derive closed formulas in terms of spectra of higher-order fractional Laplacians. For our proofs we develop new techniques in noncommutative geometry, in particular a Weyl law and Schatten-class commutators, yielding refined quantum metrics on the space of Borel probability measures. Lastly, our fractional analysis extends to dynamical systems. We showcase this in the setting of expansive algebraic $\mathbb Z^m$-actions and homoclinic $C^*$-algebras of certain hyperbolic dynamical systems. These findings illustrate the versatility of fractional analysis in fractal geometry, dynamical systems and noncommutative geometry.</description>
