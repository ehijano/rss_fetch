      <title>Nonreciprocal Equilibrium 4$\pi$-Periodic Josephson Effect from Poor Man's Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Josephson diode effect becomes possible when two coupled antiferromagnetic dimers of point-like magnetic adatoms are deposited on top of a Rashba superconductor. The degree of nonreciprocity is substantial when the arising Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states approach zero energy. In this limit, these states behave as weakly coupled poor man's Majorana (PMM) excitations. The emergence of PMMs leads to highly dispersive and phase-bias asymmetric Andreev bound state dispersions. In turn, these result in a nonreciprocal Josephson current, whose diode efficiency can be controlled by varying the geometric details of the adatom's spatial configuration. In addition, thanks to spin-triplet pairing terms mixing different YSR states, the resulting Josephson effect is $4\pi$-periodic even under equilibrium conditions. Our work opens the door to observing and harnessing Majorana behavior in currently experimentally accessible topologically trivial systems.</description>

      <title>Probing enhanced superconductivity in van der Waals polytypes of V$_x$TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stabilize in multiple structural forms with profoundly distinct and exotic electronic phases. Interfacing different layer types is a promising route to manipulate TMDs' properties, not only as a means to engineer quantum devices, but also as a route to explore fundamental physics in complex matter. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) to investigate a strong layering-dependent enhancement of superconductivity in TaS$_2$, in which the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, of its $2H$ structural phase is nearly tripled when insulating $1T$ layers are inserted into the system. The study is facilitated by a novel vanadium-intercalation approach to synthesizing various TaS$_2$ polytypes, which improves the quality of ARPES data while leaving key aspects of the electronic structure and properties intact. The spectra show the clear opening of the charge density wave gap in the pure $2H$ phase and its suppression when $1T$ layers are introduced to the system. Moreover, in the mixed-layer $4Hb$ system, we observe a strongly momentum-anisotropic increase in electron-phonon coupling near the Fermi level relative to the $2H$ phase. Both phenomena help to account for the increased $T_c$ in mixed $2H$/$1T$ layer structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry in condensed matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most celebrated accomplishments of modern physics is the description of fundamental principles of nature in the language of geometry. As the motion of celestial bodies is governed by the geometry of spacetime, the motion of electrons in condensed matter can be characterized by the geometry of the Hilbert space of their wave functions. Such quantum geometry, comprising of Berry curvature and quantum metric, can thus exert profound influences on various properties of materials. The dipoles of both Berry curvature and quantum metric produce nonlinear transport. The quantum metric plays an important role in flat-band superconductors by enhancing the transition temperature. The uniformly distributed momentum-space quantum geometry stabilizes the fractional Chern insulators and results in the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect. We here review in detail quantum geometry in condensed matter, paying close attention to its effects on nonlinear transport, superconductivity, and topological properties. Possible future research directions in this field are also envisaged.</description>

      <title>Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on rf measurement schemes involving costly and complex instrumentation. Here we demonstrate a simple dc measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the dc signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple dc measurement, has a wide band up to 200 GHz, well exceeding that of the typical rf spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal, unlike the conventional rf measurement. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique thus offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits, which is in many ways superior with respect to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization Model for Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) model to describe the magnetization and instantaneous power loss of composite superconductors. Once the parameters of the ROHM model are fixed based on reference simulations, it allows to directly compute the macroscopic response of composite superconductors without having to solve for the detailed current density distribution. It can be used as a homogenized model in large-scale superconducting systems in order to significantly reduce the computational work compared to detailed simulations. In this contribution, we focus on the case of a strand with twisted superconducting filaments subject to an external transverse magnetic field. We propose two levels of ROHM models: a rate-independent model that reproduces pure hysteresis without dynamic effects, and a rate-dependent model that generalizes the former by also reproducing dynamic effects observed in superconducting strands due to coupling and eddy currents. We describe the implementation and inclusion of these models in a finite element framework, discuss their parameter identification and finally demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Current and shot noise in a normal metal-superconductor junction driven by spin-dependent periodic pulse sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andreev reflection is a fundamental transport process occurring at the junction between a normal metal and a superconductor (a N-S junction), when an incident electron from the normal side can only be transmitted in the superconductor as a Cooper pair, with the reflection of a hole in the normal metal. As a consequence of the spin singlet nature of the BCS Cooper pairs, the current due to Andreev reflection at a N-S junction is always symmetric in spin. Using a Keldysh Nambu Floquet approach, combining analytical and numerical calculations, we study in details the AC transport at a N-S junction, when the two spin components in the normal metal are driven by different periodic drives. We show that, in the Andreev regime, i.e. when the superconducting gap is much larger than the frequency of the drives, the spin-resolved photo-assisted currents are always equal even if the two drives are different. In addition, we show that in this regime the excess noise depends only on the sum of the periodic drives, and we consider in particular the case of Lorentzian pulses (Levitons). We also show how these properties get modified when going beyond the Andreev regime. Finally we give a simple analytical proof of the special properties of the Andreev regime using an exact mapping to a particular N-N junction.</description>

      <title>Time reversal symmetry breaking and zero magnetic field Josephson diode effect in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2-mediated asymmetric SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A zero-magnetic-field Josephson diode effect (JDE) is observed in an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mediated by Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. We argue that a phase coupling between the surface and bulk superconducting channels, a unique phenomenon recently identified in the observations of fractional Josephson effect and Leggett modes in Cd3As2, can break time reversal symmetry and therefore give rise to the zero-field JDE. Our results are anticipated to have important implications in superconducting electronic circuit applications.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity from electronic dipole fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electron-electron Coulomb interactions in electronic systems whose Fermi surfaces possess a finite electric dipole density. Although there is no net dipole moment, we show that electric monopole-dipole interactions can become sufficiently strong in quasi-2D Dirac metals with spin-orbit coupling to induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity, similar to the Balian-Werthamer state of ${}^{3}$He-B. Hence materials with spin-orbit-induced band inversion, such as the doped topological insulators Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Bi$_2$Te$_3$, and SnTe, are natural candidate materials where our theory could be relevant. We discuss the conditions for an electric dipole density to appear on the Fermi surface and develop the formalism to describe its coupling to the plasmon field which mediates the Coulomb interaction. A mechanism for the enhancement of dipolar coupling is then provided for quasi-2D Dirac systems. Within a large-$N$ renormalization group treatment, we show that the out-of-plane ($z$-axis) dipole coupling is marginally relevant, in contrast to the monopole coupling which is marginally irrelevant. For physically realistic parameters, we find that dipole fluctuations can get sufficiently enhanced to result in Cooper pairing. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is directly measurable in the $z$-axis optical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Large-scale simulations of vortex Majorana zero modes in topological crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological crystalline insulators are known to support multiple Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at a single vortex, their hybridization is forbidden by a magnetic mirror symmetry $M_T$. Due to the limited energy resolution of scanning tunneling microscopes and the very small energy spacing of trivial bound states, it remains challenging to directly probe and demonstrate the existence of multiple MZMs. In this work, we propose to demonstrate the existence of MZMs by studying the hybridization of multiple MZMs in a symmetry breaking field. The different responses of trivial bound states and MZMs can be inferred from their spatial distribution in the vortex. However, the theoretical simulations are very demanding since it requires an extremely large system in real space. By utilizing the kernel polynomial method, we can efficiently simulate large lattices with over $10^8$ orbitals to compute the local density of states which bridges the gap between theoretical studies based on minimal models and experimental measurements. We show that the spatial distribution of MZMs and trivial vortex bound states indeed differs drastically in tilted magnetic fields. The zero-bias peak elongates when the magnetic field preserves $M_T$, while it splits when $M_T$ is broken, giving rise to an anisotropic magnetic response. Since the bulk of SnTe are metallic, we also study the robustness of MZMs against the bulk states, and clarify when can the MZMs produce a pronounced anisotropic magnetic response.</description>
