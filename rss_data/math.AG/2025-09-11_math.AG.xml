      <title>Homotopy Iterators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of homotopy iterators for performing polynomial homotopy continuation tasks in a memory efficient manner. The main idea is to push forward an iterator for the start solutions of a homotopy via the function which tracks them along the homotopy. Doing so produces a representation of the target solutions, bypassing the need to hold all solutions in memory. We discuss several applications of this datatype ranging from solution counting to data compression.</description>

      <title>Computation of Singular Godeaux Surfaces and a New Explicit Fake Quadric (With an Appendix by Christian Gleissner and Noah Ruhland)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational method for detecting highly singular members in families of algebraic varieties. Applying this approach to a family of numerical Godeaux surfaces, we obtain explicit examples with many singularities. In particular, we construct a Godeaux surface whose singular locus consists of two $\mathsf A_1$ and two $\mathsf A_3$ singularities. We show that this surface admits a $\mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/4$ abelian cover which is a smooth minimal surface of general type with invariants $K^2=8$ and $p_g=0$, i.e. a fake quadric. Together with the result in the Appendix, this provides the first explicit construction of a fake quadric that does not arise as a quotient of a product of curves.</description>

      <title>Virtual Poincare polynomial of moduli space of semistable sheaves of rank two on reducible curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to give an explicit description of the moduli space of semistable sheaves of rank two on a stable curve C obtained by gluing two smooth curves at a point. We prove that the moduli space is irreducible and birational to a projective bundle over the moduli space of stable vector bundles on each component curve, independently of the choice of polarization. As an application, we compute the virtual Poincare polynomial of the moduli space.</description>

Abstract: A pair of plane curves with the same combinatorics is said to be (a) a Zariski pair if the plane curves have different embedded topology, and (b) a strong Ziegler pair if their Milnor algebra are not isomorphic. We show that some examples of Zariski pairs are also strong Ziegler pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\overline{B}$ be a smooth projective varieity, and $Z \subset \overline{B}$ a simple normal crossing divisor. Assume that $B = \overline{B} - Z$ admits a variation of pure, polarized Hodge structure. The divisor $Z$ is naturally stratified, and Schmid's nilpotent orbit theorem defines a family/variation of nilpotent orbits along each strata. We study the rich geometric structure encoded by this family, its relationship to the induced (quotient) variation of pure Hodge structure on the strata, and establish a relationship between the extension data in the nilpotent orbits and the normal bundles of the smooth irreducible components of $Z$.</description>

      <title>Relative spectral correspondence for parabolic Higgs bundles and Deligne--Simpson problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the spectral correspondence for parabolic Higgs bundles established by Diaconescu--Donagi--Pantev to the relative setting. We show that the relative moduli space of $\vec{\xi}$-parabolic Higgs bundles on a curve can be realized as the relative moduli space of pure dimension one sheaves on a family of holomorphic symplectic surfaces. This leads us to formulate the image of the relative moduli space under the Hitchin map in terms of linear systems on the family of surfaces. Then we explore the relationship between the geometry of these linear systems and the so-called $OK$ condition introduced by Balasubramanian--Distler--Donagi in the context of six-dimensional superconformal field theories. As applications, we obtain (a) the non-emptiness of the moduli spaces and (b) the Deligne--Simpson problem and its higher genus analogue. In particular, we prove a conjecture proposed by Balasubramanian--Distler--Donagi that the $OK$ condition is sufficient for solving the Deligne--Simpson problem.</description>

Abstract: We formulate an effective variant of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, then review effective results on K-stability of spherical varieties, that is, K-stability criterions which can be effectively computed given the combinatorial data associated with the variety. We focus on the standard notion of K-stability as defined by Donaldson for constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fixed genus g and varying finite marking set A, the gluing and forgetful maps give the spaces of holomorphic forms on the moduli space of stable A-marked curves of genus g has the structure of an FA-module, i.e., a functor from the category of finite sets to vector spaces. We prove that the resulting FA-modules of holomorphic k-forms are simple, for k less than or equal to 18, whenever they are nonzero. Conditional upon the conjectured vanishing of holomorphic 19-forms and 20-forms in genus 3, for 15 and 16 marked points, respectively, this extends to k less than or equal to 20.</description>

      <title>Proto-Exact Categories of Matroids over Idylls and Tropical Toric Reflexive Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the category $F$-$\textbf{Mat}_\bullet$ of matroids over an idyll $F$. We show that $F$-$\textbf{Mat}_\bullet$ is a proto-exact category, a non-additive generalization of an exact category by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov. We further show that $F$-$\textbf{Mat}_\bullet$ is proto-abelian in the sense of Andr\'e. As an application, we establish that the category $\textbf{TRS}_\bullet^\Sigma$ of tropical toric reflexive sheaves associated to a fan $\Sigma$, introduced by Khan and Maclagan, is also proto-exact and proto-abelian. We then investigate the stability of modular tropical toric reflexive sheaves within the framework of proto-abelian categories and reformulate Harder-Narasimhan filtrations in this setting.</description>

      <title>Tensor Forms of Derivatives of Matrices and their applications in the Solutions to Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors and matrices, and present some identities in terms of these products. We offer tensor expressions of derivatives of tensors, focus on the tensor forms of derivatives of a matrix w.r.t. another matrix. This tensor form makes possible for us to unify ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with partial differential equations (PDEs), and facilitates solution to them in some cases. For our purpose, we also extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors (matrices) to a more general case through any partition of the modes, present some identities in terms of these products, initialize the definition of partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) of a tensor, and use the partial TuckD to simplify the PDEs. We also present a tensor form for the Lyapunov function. Our results in the products of tensors and matrices help us to establish some important equalities on the derivatives of matrices and tensors. An algorithm based on the partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) to solve the PDEs is given, and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Schanuel conjecture for 1-motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part.
  In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $\zeta$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture.
  As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ functions and of Serre functions.
  We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve.
  We prove the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points.
  We introduce the $\sigma$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a variant of Horrocks-type criteria for vector bundles mainly through a syzygy theoretic approach. Starting with explaining various proofs of the splitting criteria for ACM and Buchsbaum bundles, we are going to give new sights of an investigation of quasi-Buchsbaum bundles. Not only our result characterizes the null-correlation bundle on ${\mathbb P}^n$, but also our approach classifies quasi-Buchsbaum bundles on ${\mathbb P}^3$ with simple cohomologies in terms of standard system of parameters and the corresponding skew-symmetric matrices towards a study of the structure of quasi-Buchsbaum modules.</description>

      <title>On \alpha-stability and linear stability of generated coherent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a well studied notion of GIT-stability for coherent systems over curves, which depends on a real parameter $\alpha$. For generated coherent systems, there is a further notion of stability derived from Mumford's definition of linear stability for varieties in projective space. Let $\alpha_S$ be close to zero and $\alpha_L \gg 0$. We show that a generated coherent system which is $\alpha_S$-stable and linearly stable is $\alpha_L$-stable, and give examples showing that without further assumptions, there are no other implications between these three types of stability. We observe that several of the systems constructed have stable dual span bundle, including systems which are not $\alpha$-semistable for any value of $\alpha$. We use this to prove a case of Butler's conjecture for systems of type $(2, d, 5)$.</description>

      <title>Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>Relative Mather discrepancy on arc spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any generically \'etale morphism of varieties $f \colon X \to Y$, we define the relative Mather discrepancy function on the arc space $X_\infty$ of the domain and show that this function computes the dimension of the kernel of the differential map of the induced morphism on arc spaces $f_\infty \colon X_\infty \to Y_\infty$. We relate this result to the change-of-variable formula in motivic integration. We introduce the notion of $\widehat K$-equivalence, which agrees with $K$-equivalence for smooth varieties, and prove that $\widehat K$-equivalent varieties of arbitrary characteristic define the same class in the motivic ring.</description>

      <title>Linear stability and rank two Clifford indices of algebraic curves with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any vector bundle computing the rank-two Clifford index of a smooth projective algebraic curve is linearly semistable. We also identify conditions under which such bundles become linearly stable, thereby addressing a question posed by A. Castorena, G. H. Hitching and E. Luna in the rank-two case. Furthermore, we demostrate that in certain special cases, this property is equivalent to the (semi)stability of the associated Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles. This yields a positive answer, in specific cases, to a generalized version of a conjecture proposed by Mistretta and Stoppino. We also study the moduli space $S_0(n,d,5)$ of generated $\alpha$-stable coherent systems of type $(n,d,5)$ for small values of $\alpha$ and $n=2,3$. We show that a general element of an irreducible component of $X \subseteq S_0(2,d,5)$ or $X \subseteq S_0(3,d,5)$ is linearly stable whenever $2\delta_2 \leq d \leq \frac{3g}{2}$. As an application of this, we prove that Butler's conjecture holds non-trivially for coherent systems of type $(2,d,5)$ within the given range for $d$.</description>

      <title>The nonexistence of sections of Stiefel varieties and stably free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n)$ denote the Stiefel variety ${\rm GL}_n/{\rm GL}_{n-r}$ over a field. There is a natural projection $p: V_{r+\ell}(\mathbb{A}^n) \to V_r(\mathbb{A}^n)$. The question of whether this projection admits a section was asked by M. Raynaud in 1968. We focus on the case of $r \ge 2$ and provide examples of triples $(r,n,\ell)$ for which a section does not exist. Our results produce examples of stably free modules that do not have free summands of a given rank. To this end, we also construct a splitting of $V_2(\mathbb{A}^n)$ in the motivic stable homotopy category over a field, analogous to the classical stable splitting of the Stiefel manifolds due to I. M. James.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a monoidal model structure on the category of all curved coalgebras and show that it is Quillen equivalent, via the extended bar-cobar adjunction, to another model structure we construct on the category of curved algebras. When the coalgebras under consideration are conilpotent and the algebras are dg, i.e. uncurved, this corresponds to the ordinary dg Koszul duality of Positselski and Keller-Lef\`evre. As an application we construct global noncommutative moduli spaces for flat connections on vector bundles, holomorphic structures on almost complex vector bundles, dg modules over a dg algebra, objects in a dg category, and others.</description>

      <title>On the rationalization of the $K(n)$-local sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rational homotopy groups of the $K(n)$-local sphere for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$, verifying a prediction that goes back to the pioneering work of Morava in the early 1970s. More precisely, we show that the inclusion of the Witt vectors into the Lubin-Tate ring induces a split injection on continuous stabilizer cohomology with torsion cokernel of bounded exponent, thereby proving Hopkins' chromatic splitting conjecture and the vanishing conjecture of Beaudry-Goerss-Henn rationally. The key ingredients are the equivalence between the Lubin-Tate tower and the Drinfeld tower due to Faltings and Scholze-Weinstein, integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, and an integral refinement of a theorem of Tate on the Galois cohomology of non-archimedean fields.</description>

Abstract: We study the Milnor fiber boundary for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^3$. This is one of the examples of non-isolated surface singularities, which are studied by N\'emethi--Szil\'ard. In this paper, we compute the first homology group of the Milnor fiber boundary for a generic arrangement, which gives an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Suciu. Also, we give an example of an arrangement with $n$ hyperplanes, whose torsion part in the Milnor fiber boundary homology contains a direct summand other than $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, for certain value of $n$.</description>

      <title>Geometrically simple counterexamples to a local-global principle for quadratic twists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two abelian varieties $A$ and $B$ over a number field $K$ are said to be strongly locally quadratic twists if they are quadratic twists at every completion of $K$. While it was known that this does not imply that $A$ and $B$ are quadratic twists over $K$, the only known counterexamples (necessarily of dimension $\geq 4$) are not geometrically simple. We show that, for every prime $p\equiv 13 \pmod{24}$, there exists a pair of geometrically simple abelian varieties of dimension $p-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that are strongly locally quadratic twists but not quadratic twists. The proof is based on Galois cohomology computations and class field theory.</description>

      <title>On functoriality and the tensor product property in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. The complete prime spectrum is functorial and parametrizes radical thick tensor-ideals, a noncommutative analogue of Balmer's reconstruction theorem. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Singular intersections in families of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian scheme over $S$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a curve inside $\mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In this paper we prove that the set of points in which $\mathcal{C}$ intersects proper flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ tangentially is finite. The crucial case of elliptic curves already follows from a result by Corvaja, Demeio, Masser and Zannier: in this case we provide an alternative proof using the Pila-Zannier method. Such a proof may lead to an effective result using an effective point-counting theorem. This fits in the framework of the so-called problems of unlikely intersections, and can be seen as a variation of the relative Pink conjecture for abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Nets of conics containing a double line in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, $q$ even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper completes the classification of nets of conics containing at least one double line in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ for $q$ even. This classification contributes to the classification of partially symmetric tensors in $\mathbb{F}_q^3 \otimes S^2 \mathbb{F}_q^3$, $q$ even. The proof is obtained using geometric and combinatorial properties of the Veronese surface in 5-dimensional projective space over the finite field of even order. In particular, the orbits of planes in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$ that intersect the nucleus plane of the Veronese surface in at least one point are classified. As a result, it is shown that there are exactly $18$ equivalence classes of nets in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, $q$ even, containing at least one double line, $9$ of which have an empty base.</description>
