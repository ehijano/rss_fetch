      <title>Acquiring the Lefschetz thimbles: efficient evaluation of the diffraction integral for lensing in wave optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integral is essential in studying wave effects in astrophysical lensing, but is often intractable because of the highly oscillatory integrated. A recent breakthrough was made by exploiting the Picard-Lefschetz theory: the integral can be performed along the `Lefschetz thimbles' in the complex domain where the integrand is not oscillatory but rapidly converging. The application of this method, however, has been limited by both the unfamiliar concepts involved and the low numerical efficiency of the method used to find the Lefschetz thimbles. In this paper, we give simple examples of the Lefschetz thimbles and define the `flow lines' that facilitate the understanding of the concepts. Based on this, we propose new ways to obtain the Lefschetz thimbles with high numerical efficiency, which provide an effective tool for studying wave effects in astrophysical lensing.</description>

      <title>High-contrast imager for complex aperture telescopes (HiCAT): 8. Dark zone demonstration with simultaneous closed-loop low-order wavefront sensing and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent laboratory results demonstrating high-contrast coronagraphy for the future space-based large IR/Optical/Ultraviolet telescope recommended by the Decadal Survey. The High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed aims to implement a system-level hardware demonstration for segmented aperture coronagraphs with wavefront control. The telescope hardware simulator employs a segmented deformable mirror with 37 hexagonal segments that can be controlled in piston, tip, and tilt. In addition, two continuous deformable mirrors are used for high-order wavefront sensing and control. The low-order sensing subsystem includes a dedicated tip-tilt stage, a coronagraphic target acquisition camera, and a Zernike wavefront sensor that is used to measure and correct low-order aberration drifts. We explore the performance of a segmented aperture coronagraph both in static operations (limited by natural drifts and instabilities) and in dynamic operations (in the presence of artificial wavefront drifts added to the deformable mirrors), and discuss the estimation and control strategies used to reach and maintain the dark-zone contrast using our low-order wavefront sensing and control. We summarize experimental results that quantify the performance of the testbed in terms of contrast, inner/outer working angle and bandpass, and analyze limiting factors.</description>

      <title>Combining statistical learning with deep learning for improved exoplanet detection and characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In direct imaging at high contrast, the bright glare produced by the host star makes the detection and the characterization of sub-stellar companions particularly challenging. In spite of the use of an extreme adaptive optics system combined with a coronagraphic mask to strongly attenuate the starlight contamination, dedicated post-processing methods combining several images recorded with the pupil tracking mode of the telescope are needed to reach the required contrast. In that context, we recently proposed to combine the statistics-based model of PACO with a deep learning approach in a three-step algorithm. First, the data are centered and whitened locally using the PACO framework to improve the stationarity and the contrast in a preprocessing step. Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained in a supervised fashion to detect the signature of synthetic sources in the preprocessed science data. Finally, the trained network is applied to the preprocessed observations and delivers a detection map. A second network is trained to infer locally the photometry of detected sources. Both deep models are trained from scratch with a custom data augmentation strategy allowing to generate a large training set from a single spatio-temporo-spectral dataset. This strategy can be applied to process jointly the images of observations conducted with angular, and eventually spectral, differential imaging (A(S)DI). In this proceeding, we present in a unified framework the key ingredients of the deep PACO algorithm both for ADI and ASDI. We apply our method on several datasets from the the IRDIS imager of the VLT/SPHERE instrument. Our method reaches, in average, a better trade-off between precision and recall than the comparative algorithms.</description>

      <title>Diverging evolution of light pollution indicators: can the Globe at Night and VIIRS-DNB measurements be reconciled?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiance of nighttime artificial lights measured by the VIIRS-DNB instrument on board the satellite Suomi-NPP increases at an average rate ~2.2 %/yr worldwide, whereas the artificial radiance of the night sky deduced from the Globe at Night (GAN) unaided-eye observations of the number of visible stars is reported to increase at an average rate ~9.6 %/yr. The difference between these two estimates is remarkable. This raises the question of whether the diverging temporal evolution of these indicators could be due to changes in the spectral composition of outdoor artificial light, consequence of the current process of replacement of lighting technologies. This paper presents a model for evaluating the temporal rate of change of different light pollution indicators and applies it to the VIIRS-DNB vs GAN issue, based on available data. The results show that the reported difference could be explained by spectral changes alone, if the visual observations are made under scotopic adaptation in some specific transition conditions. In case of photopic adapted observers, however, reconciling these two measurement sets requires the existence of additional light sources that affect the Globe at Night observations but do not show up in the VIIRS-DNB data. The lumen emissions of these specific sources should increase at a rate 6 %/yr worlwide, adding to the estimated 3 %/yr of the remaining lights deduced from the VIIRS-DNB measurements corrected for spectral shift.</description>

      <title>Real-time control and data standardization on various telescopes and benches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time control (RTC) is pivotal for any Adaptive Optics (AO) system, including high-contrast imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar environments. It is the brain of the AO system, and what wavefront sensing and control (WFS\&amp;C) techniques need to work with to achieve unprecedented image quality and contrast, ultimately advancing our understanding of exoplanetary systems in the context of high contrast imaging (HCI). Developing WFS\&amp;C algorithms first happens in simulation or a lab before deployment on-sky. The transition to on-sky testing is often challenging due to the different RTCs used. Sharing common RTC standards across labs and telescope instruments would considerably simplify this process. A data architecture based on the interprocess communication method known as shared memory is ideally suited for this purpose. The CACAO package, an example of RTC based on shared memory, was initially developed for the Subaru-SCExAO instrument and now deployed on several benches and instruments. This proceeding discusses the challenges, requirements, implementation strategies, and performance evaluations associated with integrating a shared memory-based RTC. The Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory (SEAL) bench is a platform for WFS\&amp;C development for large ground-based segmented telescopes. Currently, SEAL offers the user a non-real-time version of CACAO, a shared-memory based RTC package initially developed for the Subaru-SCExAO instrument, and now deployed on several benches and instruments. We show here the example of the SEAL RTC upgrade as a precursor to both RTC upgrade at the 3-m Shane telescopes at Lick Observatory (Shane-AO) and a future development platform for the Keck II AO. This paper is aimed at specialists in AO, astronomers, and WFS\&amp;C scientists seeking a deeper introduction to the world of RTCs.</description>

      <title>Radio Emission from Atmosphere-Skimming Cosmic Ray Showers in High-Altitude Balloon-Borne Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmosphere-skimming air showers are initiated by cosmic rays with incoming directions that allow the cascade to develop entirely within the atmosphere, without reaching the ground. Radio pulses induced by this type of showers have already been observed in balloon-borne experiments such as ANITA, but a detailed characterisation of their properties is lacking. The extreme range of densities in which these cascades can develop gives rise to a wide range of shower profiles, with radio emission characteristics that can differ significantly from those of regular downward-going showers. In this work, we have used the ZHAireS-RASPASS program to characterise the expected radio emission from atmosphere-skimming air showers and its properties. We have studied the interplay between the magnetic field and atmospheric density profile in the expected radio signal, focusing on its detection aboard balloon-borne experiments. The almost horizontal geometry of the events gives rise to a significant \textit{refractive} asymmetry in the spatial distribution of the electric field, due to the propagation of the radio signals across a gradient of index of refraction. In addition, a unique \textit{coherence} asymmetry appears in the intensity of the signals, as a consequence of the cumulative effect of the Earth's magnetic field over the very long distances that these particle cascades traverse. The implications of the peculiar characteristics of the emission are discussed regarding their impact both on the interpretation of collected data and in the exposure of balloon-borne experiments</description>

      <title>First operation of LArTPC in the stratosphere as an engineering GRAMS balloon flight (eGRAMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRAMS (Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey) is a next-generation balloon/satellite experiment utilizing a LArTPC (Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber), to simultaneously target astrophysical observations of cosmic MeV gamma-rays and conduct an indirect dark matter search using antimatter. While LArTPCs are widely used in particle physics experiments, they have never been operated at balloon altitudes. An engineering balloon flight with a small-scale LArTPC (eGRAMS) was conducted on July 27th, 2023, to establish a system for safely operating a LArTPC at balloon altitudes and to obtain cosmic-ray data from the LArTPC. The flight was launched from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Taiki Aerospace Research Field in Hokkaido, Japan. The total flight duration was 3 hours and 12 minutes, including a level flight of 44 minutes at a maximum altitude of 28.9~km. The flight system was landed on the sea and successfully recovered. The LArTPC was successfully operated throughout the flight, and about 0.5 million events of the cosmic-ray data including muons, protons, and Compton scattering gamma-ray candidates, were collected. This pioneering flight demonstrates the feasibility of operating a LArTPC in high-altitude environments, paving the way for future GRAMS missions and advancing our capabilities in MeV gamma-ray astronomy and dark matter research.</description>

      <title>The Near-Ultraviolet eXplorer (NUX): a ground-based wide-field near-UV telescope to search for near-UV transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Near-Ultraviolet eXplorer (NUX), which will consist out of 4 small (36 cm diameter) ground-based telescopes that are optimized for the shortest wavelengths that are detectable from Earth (i.e., the near-UV [NUV] wavelength range of 300-350 nm). Each telescope will have a field-of-view of ~17 square degrees sampled at ~2.6"/pixel, and will reach a NUV magnitude (AB) of 20 in 2.5 minutes exposures (in dark time). The goal of NUX is to improve our understanding of the physical processes that power fast (days) to very fast (hours) hot transients, such as shock-breakout and shock-cooling emission of supernovae and the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events. Each telescope will be an off-the-shelf 14" Celestron RASA telescope, retrofitted with NUV optics. We have already demonstrated that the normal Schmidt corrector of this telescope can be replaced by a custom made one consisting of NUV transparent glass. Currently, a prototype NUX telescope is being fully assembled to demonstrate the technical and scientific feasibility of the NUX concept. Site tests will be held (in 2025/2026) at La Silla, Chile, to determine the NUV characteristics of the atmosphere at this site.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.726 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.261 +/- 0.009 M_sun and M_2 = 0.252 +/- 0.017 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 7.42 +/- 0.33 AU and a distance of D_L = 2.31 +/- 0.09 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few AUs) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Variational inference for correlated gravitational wave detector network noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and LISA generate long multivariate time series, which pose significant challenges in spectral density estimation due to a number of overlapping signals as well as the presence of correlated noise. Addressing both issues is crucial for accurately interpreting the signals detected by these instruments. This paper presents an application of a variational inference spectral density estimation method specifically tailored for dealing with correlated noise in the data. It is flexible in that it does not rely on any specific parametric form for the multivariate spectral density. The method employs a blocked Whittle likelihood approximation for stationary time series and utilizes the Cholesky decomposition of the inverse spectral density matrix to ensure a positive definite estimator. A discounted regularized horseshoe prior is applied to the spline coefficients of each Cholesky factor, and the posterior distribution is computed using a stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach. This method is particularly effective in addressing correlated noise, a significant challenge in the analysis of multivariate data from co-located detectors. The method is demonstrated by analyzing 2000 seconds of simulated Einstein Telescope noise, which shows its ability to produce accurate spectral density estimates and quantify coherence between time series components. This makes it a powerful tool for analyzing correlated noise in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Cleaning WASP-33 b transits from the host star photometric variability: analysis of TESS data from two sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$ Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33 b transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$ s to $18$ s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed by von Essen et al. (2020) based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

Abstract: Experimental 21 cm cosmology aims to detect the formation of the first stars during the cosmic dawn and the subsequent epoch of reionization by utilizing the 21 cm hydrogen line transition. While several experiments have published results that begin to constrain the shape of this signal, a definitive detection has yet to be achieved. In this paper, we investigate the influence of uncertain antenna-sky interactions on the possibility of detecting the signal. This paper aims to define the level of accuracy to which a simulated antenna beam pattern is required to agree with the actual observing beam pattern of the antenna to allow for a confident detection of the global 21 cm signal. By utilising singular value decomposition, we construct a set of antenna power patterns that incorporate minor, physically motivated variations. We take the absolute mean averaged difference between the original beam and the perturbed beam averaged over frequency ($\Delta D$) to quantifying this difference, identifying the correlation between $\Delta D$ and antenna temperature. To analyse the impact of $\Delta D$ on making a confident detection, we utilize the REACH Bayesian analysis pipeline and compare the Bayesian evidence $\log \mathcal{Z}$ and root-mean-square error for antenna beams of different $\Delta D$ values. Our calculations suggest that achieving an agreement between the original and perturbed antenna power pattern with $\Delta D$ better than -35 dB is necessary for confident detection of the global 21 cm signal. Furthermore, we discuss potential methods to achieve the required high level of accuracy within a global 21~cm experiment.</description>

      <title>Identifying Light-curve Signals with a Deep Learning Based Object Detection Algorithm. II. A General Light Curve Classification Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08080</link>

Abstract: Vast amounts of astronomical photometric data are generated from various projects, requiring significant effort to identify variable stars and other object classes. In light of this, a general, widely applicable classification framework would simplify the process of designing specific classifiers for various astronomical objects. We present a novel deep learning framework for classifying light curves using a weakly supervised object detection model. Our framework identifies the optimal windows for both light curves and power spectra automatically, and zooms in on their corresponding data. This allows for automatic feature extraction from both time and frequency domains, enabling our model to handle data across different scales and sampling intervals. We train our model on data sets obtained from Kepler, TESS, and Zwicky Transient Facility multiband observations of variable stars and transients. We achieve an accuracy of 87% for combined variables and transient events, which is comparable to the performance of previous feature-based models. Our trained model can be utilized directly for other missions, such as the All-sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning. To address known issues with miscalibrated predictive probabilities, we apply conformal prediction to generate robust predictive sets that guarantee true-label coverage with a given probability. Additionally, we incorporate various anomaly detection algorithms to empower our model with the ability to identify out-of-distribution objects. Our framework is implemented in the Deep-LC toolkit, which is an open-source Python package hosted on Github (https://github.com/ckm3/Deep-LC) and PyPI.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Practical Application of Nested Sampling: MultiNest, (Non)convergence, and Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nested sampling is a promising tool for Bayesian statistical analysis because it simultaneously performs parameter estimation and facilitates model comparison. MultiNest is one of the most popular nested sampling implementations, and has been applied to a wide variety of problems in the physical sciences. However, MultiNest results, like those of any sampling tool, can be unreliable, and accompanying convergence tests are a necessary component of any analysis. Using analytically tractable test problems, I illustrate how MultiNest, when applied without rigorously chosen hyperparameters, (1) can produce systematically erroneous estimates of the Bayesian evidence, which are more significantly biased for problems of higher dimensionality; (2) can derive posterior estimates with errors on the order of $\sim100\%$; (3) can, particularly when sampling noisy likelihood functions, systematically underestimate posterior widths. Furthermore, I show how MultiNest, thanks to the advantageous speed at which it explores parameter space, can also be used to jump-start Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or more rigorous nested sampling techniques, potentially accelerating more robust measurements of posterior distributions and Bayesian evidences, and overcoming the challenge of Markov chain Monte Carlo initialization.</description>

      <title>The EUSO-SPB2 Fluorescence Telescope for the Detection of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>

Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) flew on May 13$^{\text{th}}$ and 14$^{\text{th}}$ of 2023. Consisting of two novel optical telescopes, the payload utilized next-generation instrumentation for the observations of extensive air showers from near space. One instrument, the fluorescence telescope (FT) searched for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) by recording the atmosphere below the balloon in the near-UV with a 1~$\mu$s time resolution using 108 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes with a total of 6,912 channels. Validated by pre-flight measurements during a field campaign, the energy threshold was estimated around 2~EeV with an expected event rate of approximately 1 event per 10 hours of observation. Based on the limited time afloat, the expected number of UHECR observations throughout the flight is between 0 and 2. Consistent with this expectation, no UHECR candidate events have been found. The majority of events appear to be detector artifacts that were not rejected properly due to a shortened commissioning phase. Despite the earlier-than-expected termination of the flight, data were recorded which provide insights into the detectors stability in the near-space environment as well as the diffuse ultraviolet emissivity of the atmosphere, both of which are impactful to future experiments.</description>

      <title>Prospects for joint reconstruction of imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array and extensive air shower array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we proposed a joint reconstruction of \gray events using both extensive air array (EAS) and Imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array (IACT). We considered eight Cherenkov telescopes to be built on the LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) site and investigate the improvement in differential sensitivity when combining the information from both IACT and Moun detectors of LHAASO-KM2A. We found that due to the higher cosmic ray background rejection power and higher gamma ray retention ratio provided by muon detectors of LHAASO, such a joint reconstruction can significantly improve the sensitivity of IACTs, especially for extended sources and long exposure time. In this article, we have shown the performance of an eight-telescopes mini array, and our results indicate that above $10~\rm TeV$, the sensitivity can be improved by muon detector from $25\% - 60\%$ in different energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wavedetector below the standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

Abstract: In this work we aim at developing a new class of high order accurate well-balanced finite difference (FD) Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) methods for numerical general relativity, which can be applied to any first-order reduction of the Einstein field equations, even if non-conservative terms are present. We choose the first-order non-conservative Z4 formulation of the Einstein equations, which has a built-in cleaning procedure that accounts for the Einstein constraints and that has already shown its ability in keeping stationary solutions stable over long timescales. Upon the introduction of auxiliary variables, the vacuum Einstein equations in first order form constitute a ...</description>
