      <title>Quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in halos of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>

      <title>Good tachyons, bad bradyons: role reversal in Einstein-nonlinear-electrodynamics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic mechanics, the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum need not be parallel. This allows their norm to have a different sign. This possibility occurs in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) models minimally coupled to Einstein's theory. Surprisingly, for a large class of NED models with a Maxwell limit, for weak fields, the causal (acausal) photons, as determined by their 4-velocity, have a spacelike (timelike) 4-momentum, leading to good tachyons and bad bradyons. Departing from weak fields, this possibility is determined solely by the concavity of the NED Lagrangian, which is consistent with the Dominant Energy Condition analysis. As a corollary, some popular regular black hole solutions sourced by NED, such as the Bardeen and Hayward solutions, are acausal.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Model with specific q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We place observational constraints on an FLRW cosmological model in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity with a specific deceleration parameter that depends on the scale factor. This form of the deceleration parameter has been discussed by authors in several papers, but none of them have applied observations to constrain the variables of the model. We carry this out with the cosmic chronometer, supernovae and the baryon acoustic oscillation datasets. The optimum values for the relevant parameters are found and used to plot the kinematical and physical parameters of the model. Although the model tends to the standard Lambda cold dark matter model at late times, there are several issues with the model concerning the values of some of the parameters and the energy conditions. The transition redshift of the model does not match with Planck data. The equation of state parameter indicates that the model falls into the category of phantom dark energy, which is not well supported by observations. Thus, the model does not seem viable.</description>

      <title>Universal cosmological solutions in Lovelock gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Friedmann field equations within the framework of Lovelock gravity, a natural extension of Einstein's gravity, focusing on both flat and open universes. Utilizing an approach based on independent Riemann tensor components, we derive generalized Friedmann equations for Lovelock gravity and categorize the solutions into Type I and Type II types. We identify additional vacuum solutions in a flat universe and present a comprehensive solution for a pressure-free scenario in an open universe, both unique to Lovelock gravity. These findings provide new insights into the cosmological implications of Lovelock gravity and offer a foundation for further exploration into the universe's evolutionary trajectory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from equatorially eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals around swirling Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the gravitational wave generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) along eccentric orbits on equatorial plane within the frame of the swirling-Kerr black hole spacetime. The swirling-Kerr black hole has an extra swirling parameter, which characterizes the rotation of universe background. Our findings indicate that this swirling parameter leads to a delay phase shift in the gravitational waveforms. The impact of the swirling parameter on EMRI gravitational waves is suppressed by the black hole's spin parameter. As a result, extracting information about the swirling parameter from gravitational waves in a static black hole spacetime is much easier than in the case of a rapidly rotating black hole. Our analysis also shows that a high black hole spin leads to a greater overlap of gravitational waveforms for different swirling parameters. We further investigate the potential issue of waveform confusion caused by the orbital eccentricity and semi-latus rectum parameters. As the swirling parameter increases, the relative variation in eccentricity also increases, while the variation in the semi-latus rectum decreases rapidly. The trends in these changes with the swirling parameter resemble those observed with the MOG (Modified Gravity) parameter, though with different rates of change. These results provide deeper insights into the properties of EMRI gravitational waves and the swirling of the universe background.</description>

      <title>Rotating Traversable wormholes with two cosmic strings at the throat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how rotating traversable wormholes incorporate two cosmic strings at the throat of the wormhole. Building on arXiv:gr-qc/9803098v2 for rotating traversable wormholes and arXiv:gr-qc/0401036 analysis of scalar perturbations, a modified metric that accounts for these cosmic string perturbations is presented. This paper evaluates the Null Energy Condition in the presence of these string perturbations and focuses mainly on the scalar field dynamics in this modified spacetime. Using localized Gaussian perturbations to model cosmic string effects, this paper discusses the impact of angular and radial distributions from the cosmic strings on the spacetime geometry. Regularization has been applied to the shape function and energy condition violations at the wormhole throat, helping to eliminate divergences. The paper concludes with the result that the presence of cosmic strings induces unique anisotropic contributions. Future work could explore gravitational wave signatures associated with similar systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present phenomenological signatures for a modified gravity model f(R), constructed with linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic terms. The obtained signatures satisfy current phenomenological bounds reported by PLANCK and BICEP3. Furthermore, two of the model solutions $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ seem to favor a much lower value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $0.0005&lt;r_{\sigma_1}&lt;0.0015$ and $r_{\sigma_2}&lt;0.00015$ than the current reported experimental bounds. The results we obtained are quantitatively similar to those presented in previous studies for $R^3$ models.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>3+1 formalism of the minimally extended varying speed of light model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3+1$ formalism provides a structured approach to analyzing spacetime by separating it into spatial and temporal components. When applied to the Robertson-Walker metric, it simplifies the analysis of cosmological evolution by dividing the Einstein field equations into constraint and evolution equations. It introduces the lapse function $N$ and the shift vector $N^i$, which control how time and spatial coordinates evolve between hypersurfaces. In standard model cosmology, $N = 1$ and $N^i = 0$ for the Robertson-Walker metric. However, the $N$ becomes a function of time when we apply the metric to the minimally extended varying speed of light model. This approach allows for a more direct examination of the evolution of spatial geometry and offers flexibility in handling scenarios where the lapse function and shift vector vary. In this manuscript, we derive the model's $N$ and $N^i$, along with the constraint and evolution equations, and demonstrate their consistency with the existing Einstein equations. We have shown in a previous paper that the possibility of changes in the speed of light in the Robertson-Walker metric is due to cosmological time dilation. Through the $3+1$ formalism, we can make the physical significance more explicit and demonstrate that it can be interpreted as the lapse function. From this, we show that the minimally extended varying speed of light model is consistent.</description>

      <title>Matching McVittie spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational collapse and bubble evolution in the asymptotical Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe is an intriguing and intricate problem. We systematically analyze dynamics for contact \sch-FLRW (McVittie) spacetimes, focusing on their general junction conditions and introducing a novel function to simplify the extrinsic curvature and surface stress-energy tensor. We explore both static and dynamic scenarios, including special cases such as Schwarzschild, FLRW, and Einstein-Straus configurations by using our general framework. Numerical calculations further reveal the evolution of the concentric McVittie spacetimes with various initial conditions, offering deep insights into the interplay between the McVittie mass parameter and initial peculiar velocity. These results provide a unified perspective for understanding gravitational collapse and bubble evolution in cosmology and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Vector wormholes as conduits for matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the dynamics of a massive one-form field, \textbf{B}, often referred to simply as a vector field, that is minimally coupled to standard Einstein gravity. In the framework of four-dimensional spacetimes, the theory of a massive one-form propagates three massive vector degrees of freedom. The inclusion of a self-interacting potential in this theory results in the breaking of gauge invariance. The breaking of such a fundamental symmetry in Classical Electromagnetism may introduce a ghost mode in massive vector theories, which generally leads to their instability. However, in the context of wormhole physics, the existence of at least one ghost degree of freedom turns out to be a necessary condition to support these exotic geometries within effective field theories. This requirement serves as a strong motivation for our work, wherein we explore the role and phenomenology of massive one-forms, minimally coupled to Einstein gravity, in providing the necessary conditions to sustain wormhole spacetimes. We further analyze the coupling of matter fields to such a vector field through conformal couplings and explore their impact on energy conditions and the physical viability of wormhole solutions.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors for massive fields in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of black holes has been established. This correspondence is known to be exact in the eikonal regime for a large class of asymptotically flat black holes and approximate when the multipole number \( \ell \) is small. In this work, we demonstrate that there exists a regime where the correspondence holds with unprecedented accuracy even for the lowest multipole numbers: specifically, for perturbations of massive fields in the background of asymptotically de Sitter black holes, provided the field mass is not very small. We also fill the gap in the existing literature via finding the grey-body factors of a massive scalar field in the Schwarzschild- de Sitter background, when $\mu M/m_{P}$ is not small.</description>

      <title>Significant circular Unruh effect at small acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transition rates of an atom rotating in a circular orbit, which is coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that when the rotational angular velocity exceeds the transition frequency of the atom, the excitation rate can reach the same order of magnitude as the emission rate, even with an extremely low centripetal acceleration resulting from a very small orbital radius. For experimentally accessible centripetal accelerations, the excitation rate of centripetally accelerated atoms can be up to ten to the power of two hundred thousand times that of linearly accelerated atoms with the same acceleration. Our result suggests that the circular version of the Unruh effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations, contrary to the common belief that a large Unruh effect requires large acceleration. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the circular Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>HBT interferometry and Quantum Detection of Primordial Gravitational Waves in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity (to be precise, its projectable version) is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. Notably, one of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It has been suggested that, for some inflationary models, the non-classicality of primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed coherent quantum state can be detected using the Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) interferometry. We show that in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves can be generated during both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras of the Universe. Moreover, the frequency range of their quantum signatures is shown to extend beyond that of inflationary models.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly establish that the Kerr metric represents a pair of self-dual and anti-self-dual gravitational dyons (Taub-NUT instantons). We show that the Newman-Janis algorithm precisely originates from this fact. More generally, this program of understanding four-dimensional black holes as systems of chiral dyons extends to Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Taub-NUT solutions as well.</description>

      <title>An impediment to torsion from spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modifications of standard general relativity that bring torsion into a game have a long-standing history. However, no convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the torsion shall be excluded from the consideration. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <title>Multipole moments in stationary spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. In this paper, we review the construction of the Geroch--Hansen multipole moments for stationary asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. Based on Geroch's approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments behave under such transformations.</description>

      <title>Combining Machine Learning with Recurrence Analysis for resonance detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The width of a resonance in a nearly integrable system, i.e. in a non-integrable system where chaotic motion is still not prominent, can tell us how a perturbation parameter is driving the system away from integrability. Although the tool that we are presenting here can be used is quite generic and can be used in a variety of systems, our particular interest lies in binary compact object systems known as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In an EMRI a lighter compact object, like a black hole or a neutron star, inspirals into a supermassive black hole due to gravitational radiation reaction. During this inspiral the lighter object crosses resonances, which are still not very well modeled. Measuring the width of resonances in EMRI models allows us to estimate the importance of each perturbation parameter able to drive the system away from resonances and decide whether its impact should be included in EMRI waveform modeling or not. To tackle this issue in our study we show first that recurrence quantifiers of orbits carry imprints of resonant behavior, regardless of the system's dimensionality. As a next step, we apply a long short-term memory machine learning architecture to automate the resonance detection procedure. Our analysis is developed on a simple standard map and gradually we extend it to more complicated systems until finally we employ it in a generic deformed Kerr spacetime known in the literature as the Johannsen-Psaltis spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations in a gravitational collapse simulation with SpheriCo.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on work using a newly developed code, SpheriCo.jl, that computes the gravitational collapse of a spherical scalar field, where the scalar can be either a classical field, or a quantum field operator. By utilising summation-by-parts methods for the numerical derivatives we are able to simulate the collapse longer than was possible previously due to enhanced numerical stability. We present a suite of tests for the code that tests its accuracy and stability, both for the classical and quantum fields. We are able to observe critical behavior of gravitational collapse for the classical setup, in agreement with expected results. The code is also used to compute two-point correlation functions, with results that hint at a non-trivial correlation across the horizon of Hawking quanta.</description>

      <title>Fully-relativistic evolution of vacuum tensor inhomogeneities during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete method for the initialisation and extraction of first-order inflationary tensor perturbations for fully relativistic simulations which incorporate gravitational back-reaction. We outline a correspondence between the Cosmological Perturbation Theory (CPT) framework and the numerical relativity BSSN variables in the appropriate limit. We describe a generation method for stochastic tensoral initial conditions, inspired by the standard scalar initial condition used from inflation and implemented in lattice cosmology. We discuss the implementation of this procedure in the GRChombo/GRTeclyn code, and demonstrate the detailed quantitative correspondence between the linearised and fully-nonlinear solutions in the perturbative limit, through the evolution of the background and the tensor power spectrum. We also validate the methodology by showing that energy and momentum constraints are introduced and preserved to second-order or better. We provide some preliminary indicative results probing tensoral non-Gaussianity using the skewness and kurtosis. The computational pipeline presented here will be used to study the emergence of a primordial tensor bispectra and cross-spectra that incorporate the effect of nonlinear gravitational couplings with the metric, which has potential applications for the analysis of next-generation CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>On the uplift of 4D wormholes in Braneworld models and their 5D structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the consistent embedding of general 4D static and spherically-symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary single-brane braneworld models [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 4, L041501] initiated the program of studying the bulk structure of braneworld wormholes. In this article, adopting a completely generic approach, we derive the general conditions that the metric functions of any braneworld spacetime must satisfy to describe a wormhole structure in the bulk. Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying the proper uplift of 4D wormholes, expressed in terms of various radial coordinates on the brane, and we demonstrate the important role of the circumferential radius metric function for the embedding. Additionally, the flare-out conditions for braneworld wormholes are presented for the first time and are found to differ from the case of flat extra dimensions. To illustrate the method, we first perform the uplift into the Randall-Sundrum II braneworld model for three well-known 4D wormhole spacetimes; the effective braneworld wormhole solutions of Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati and Bronnikov-Kim, and the Simpson-Visser spacetime. Subsequently, we study their bulk features by means of curvature invariants, flare-out conditions, energy conditions and embedding diagrams. Our analysis reveals that the assumption of a warped extra dimension has non-trivial implications for the structure of 5D wormholes.</description>

      <title>The higher dimensional instabilities of AdS in holographic semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of AdS/CFT duality, we consider the semiclassical problem in general quadratic theory of gravity. We construct asymptotically global AdS and hyperbolic~(topological) AdS black hole solutions with non-trivial quantum hair in $4$ and $5$-dimensions by perturbing the maximally symmetric AdS solutions to the holographic semiclassical equations. We find that under certain conditions, our semiclassical solution of hyperbolic AdS black holes can be dynamically unstable against linear perturbations. In this holographic semiclassical context, we also study the thermodynamic instability of the hairy solutions in the $5$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory by computing the free energy and show that depending on the parameter of the Gauss-Bonnet theory, the free energy can be smaller than that of the background maximally symmetric AdS solution in both the global AdS and hyperbolic AdS black hole cases.</description>

      <title>Schrodinger-Newton solitons with axial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the Schr\"odinger-Newton problem of Newtonian gravity coupled to a nonrelativistic scalar particle for solutions with axial symmetry. The gravitational potential is driven by a mass density assumed to be proportional to the probability density of the scalar. Unlike related calculations for condensates of ultralight dark matter or boson stars, no assumption of spherical symmetry is made for the effective gravitational potential. Instead, the potential has only axial symmetry, consistent with the axial symmetry of the particle's probability density for eigenstates of $L_z$. With total angular momentum no longer a good quantum number, there are in general contributions from a range of partial waves. This permits us to study the partial-wave content of self-consistent solutions of the Schr\"odinger-Newton system.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds Parameter Estimation in Pulsar Timing Arrays with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are essential tools for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), but their analysis faces significant computational challenges. Traditional methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces where noise parameters often dominate, while existing deep learning approaches fail to model the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation or are validated only on synthetic datasets. We propose a flow-matching-based continuous normalizing flow (CNF) for efficient and accurate PTA parameter estimation. By focusing on the 10 most contributive pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, our method achieves posteriors consistent with MCMC, with a Jensen-Shannon divergence below \(10^{-2}\) nat, while reducing sampling time from 50 hours to 4 minutes. Powered by a versatile embedding network and a reweighting loss function, our approach prioritizes the SGWB parameters and scales effectively for future datasets. It enables precise reconstruction of SGWB and opens new avenues for exploring vast observational data and uncovering potential new physics, offering a transformative tool for advancing gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Implications for the non-Gaussianity of primordial gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic signal by recent pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, including NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, CPTA and MPTA, has opened a new window to explore gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies. Motivated by the possibility that such a signal could arise from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), we investigate the implications of tensor non-Gaussianity for the PGW power spectrum. Utilizing PTA data sets, we provide constraints on local-type tensor non-Gaussianity parameter ${F}_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We find $|{F}_{\mathrm{NL}}|\lesssim 7.97$ for a log-normal PGW power spectrum. Our analysis reveals that even moderate tensor non-Gaussianity can lead to significant deviations from standard predictions, thereby offering a novel means to test inflationary scenarios and probe the underlying dynamics of the early Universe. Future multi-band GW observatories, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, will be instrumental in complementing these efforts and further refining our understanding of tensor non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is believed to account for a significant portion of the mass in the universe, exerting a critical influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. This research delves into the processes of annihilation and decay of dark matter particles, which generate observable signals that deepen our comprehension of their characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, the study explores the potential role of primordial black holes, with a focus on the emissions of Hawking radiation that could offer valuable insights into their distribution and size range. A key aspect of this investigation revolves around the 21 cm signal, a vital tool for scrutinizing the effects of dark matter particles and primordial black hole phenomena on the intergalactic medium. The upcoming Hongmeng mission, featuring a lunar orbital interferometer array, is poised to revolutionize our ability to observe the 21 cm signal. By conducting measurements devoid of atmospheric disturbances, the mission will significantly boost sensitivity to subtle signals associated with dark matter particle annihilation, decay, and primordial black hole emissions. This study assesses the expected performance of the Hongmeng mission in detecting these telltale signs and aims to unveil fresh insights into the nature and interactions of dark matter particles and primordial black hole emissions through a meticulous analysis of the global 21 cm spectrum. The mission holds immense promise for reshaping our understanding of the universe's concealed components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and argue that such transfer may remain inefficient at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations . The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is the particle in central field with varying trajectories restricted by equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space gets one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for precession of trajectories. $K=0$ corresponds to the trajectories of usual Lagrangian dynamics. The second example is the linearized gravity with Einstein-Hilbert action and the class of varying fields is restricted by linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field along its standard circular path (cyclotron motion) reacts to a short-duration, homogeneous, uniform electric field pulse injected in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle and a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched off. The magnitude of the velocity undergoes a change too, akin to a `velocity kick'. In summary, our results suggest a pulse-induced `electromagnetic memory-like effect', which is not quite a `wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can affect the behavior of dark matter in galaxy clusters. We have considered the case of a disformal coupling, which leads to a modification of the Poisson equation. Building on an earlier work, we expand the analysis considering all possible disformal coupling scenarios and employing various dark matter density profiles. In doing so, we aim to constrain the key parameter in our model, the characteristic coupling length. To achieve this, we analyze data from a combination of strong and weak lensing using three statistical approaches: a single cluster fitting procedure, a joint analysis, and one with stacked profiles. Our findings show that the coupling length is typically very small, thus being fully consistent with general relativity, although with an upper limit at $1\sigma$ which is of the order of $100$ kpc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity famously predicts precession of orbital motions in the Schwarzschild metric. In this paper we show that by adding a NUT charge $N = iM$ the precession vanishes to all orders in $G$ even for rotating black holes. Moreover, we conjecture a generalization of the eikonal formula and show that the classical integrable trajectories determine the full quantum amplitude for this black hole, by means of exponentiation of the Post-Minkowskian radial action. Several consequences of integrability in self-dual gravity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation from the Upward Step Model: Avoiding Overproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an upward step inflationary model, where nonlinearities between curvature perturbations and field fluctuations introduce a cutoff, deviating from the Gaussian case. This necessitates a reevaluation of PBH formation, as $\mathcal{R}$ is not the optimal variable for estimating abundance. Using the extended Press-Schechter formalism, we show that non-Gaussianity modifies both the curvature perturbation profile $\mathcal{R}(r)$ and the integration path in probability space, significantly impacting PBH abundance. Our results reveal that the abundance initially increases with the parameter $h$, which characterizes the relaxation stage after the step. However, beyond a critical value ($h \simeq 5.9$), it sharply declines before rising again. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianity introduces uncertainties in indirect PBH observations via gravitational waves. Notably, we present an example where a positive $f_{\rm NL}$ does not necessarily enhance PBH production, contrary to conventional expectations. Finally, by accounting for non-perturbative effects, we resolve the overproduction of PBHs suggested by pulsar timing array (PTA) data, underscoring the critical importance of incorporating non-Gaussianity in future studies.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Love Numbers for Extremal Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the gravitational tidal Love numbers of extremal zero-temperature Kerr black holes. These coefficients are finite and exhibit the dissipative nature of these maximally spinning black holes. Upon considering the dynamical behavior of the tidal deformations of the extremal Kerr black holes, we provide explicit expressions of the Love numbers at low frequencies. Their calculation is simplified to specific formulas, which are directly derived using the Leaver-MST methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the results of Bamonti and Gomes (2024) concerning the dynamical (un)coupling of reference frames to gravity to analyse the role of reference frames in the Hole Argument. We introduce a new possible threat to determinism, which we call Arbitrariness Problem (ARB), resulting from the inherent freedom in selecting a reference frame.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation in order to recover standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling $\alpha$ that is typically very small and functions like $\hbar$ in a WKB expansion. We seek solutions of the form $\Psi = e^{iS/\alpha} \psi$ that are the closest quantum analog of a given classical background spacetime. The function $S$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, while $\psi$ obeys a Schr\"odinger-like equation and has a clear probabilistic interpretation. By using the semiclassical limit we express the relation between $\psi$ and the wavefunction of the universe in perturbation theory, $\psi_P$. We apply our formalism to two main examples. The first is a scalar field with a purely exponential potential, of which particularly simple, scaling solutions are known. The other is a slow-roll scenario expanded in the vicinity of the origin in field space. We discuss possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the higher ``time" derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation but not in the perturbative approach. We clarify the conditional probability content of the wavefunctions and how this is related with the standard gauge fixing procedure in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>A non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics and gravity with local modulus symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics and gravity based on local modulus symmetry. Our theory has three main new features compared to conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. They include a new quantum metric function needed to modify the complex conjugate of the wave function, a gravitational Poisson equation that accounts for part of the gravitational potential energy but not all, and a new background energy term in the quantum particle equation of motion. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The extra term in the gravitational potential energy is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become dominant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed. The new background energy term turns out to be half of the Planck constant multiplied by the Hubble constant. It has a peculiar numerical value related to the Planck energy density and the current estimate of the dark energy.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Scalar Torsion Theories with Nonminimal Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and structure of static and slowly rotating neutron stars (NSs) in a particular truncation of scalar torsion theory with a scalar field $ \phi $ non-minimally coupled to the torsion scalar, and a potential of the form $ V(\phi)=-\mu^2\phi^2/2 +\lambda \phi^4 /4 $. We derive the hydrostatic equilibrium equations in the static case and solve them numerically for both interior and exterior regions using the appropriate boundary conditions near the center and far from the star. We plot the radial profiles of the metric functions and the scalar field as well as the mass-radius diagram of the star employing a set of four different realistic equations of state (EoS). Our findings show a high degree of compatibility with the observational constraints of the GW170817 event and indicate a maximum mass $2.37M_{\odot}$ obtained with the BSk21 EoS for a coupling parameter $ \xi=0.25 $. We extend our analysis to include slow rotation, and determine the relation between the star's moment of inertia and its mass. We also show that the universality relation of the two forms of the normalized moment of inertia continue to hold in scalar torsion theory with non minimal coupling.</description>

      <title>Local Short-Time Acceleration induced Spectral Line Broadening and Possible Implications in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes an acceleration effect that a local short-time acceleration produces an additional broadening to spectral line, while the central value of the line remains unaffected. The effect can be considered as a local and non-uniform generalization of Unruh effect. Although the acceleration-induced line broadening effect is too small to be measured in ordinary lab setup, it may offer us a key concept to gain a simple and unified perspective on the cosmic acceleration and the radial acceleration discrepancy of rotating galaxies. We find that the measurement of the acceleration of the cosmic expansion by fitting the distance-redshift relation is essentially the measurement of the line or redshift broadening, and the cosmic acceleration induced line broadening also plays a crucial role in the acceleration discrepancy at the outskirt of rotating galaxies. Possible predictions of the effect are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems analysis of a cosmological model with interacting Umami Chaplygin fluid in adiabatic particle creation mechanism: Some bouncing features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work aims to investigate an interacting Umami Chaplygin gas in the background dynamics of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe when adiabatic particle creation is allowed. Here, the universe is taken to be an open thermodynamical model where the particle is created irreversibly and consequently, the creation pressure comes into the energy-momentum tensor of the material content. The particle creation rate is assumed to have a linear relationship with the Hubble parameter ($\Gamma \propto H$) and the created particle is dark matter (pressureless). With this creation rate a single fluid model studied and found no phase transition. Then, we studied an interacting two-fluid model where second fluid is taken as perfect fluid equation of state and late-time acceleration is obtained. Next, interacting Umami chaplygin gas is studied in context of particle creation. Dynamical stability of the model is performed. Classical stability of the model is also studied at each critical point. Some critical points exhibit the accelerated de Sitter expansion of the universe at both the early phase as well as the late phase of evolution which is characterized by completely Umami Chaplygin fluid equation of state. Scaling solutions are also described by some other critical points showing late-time accelerated attractors in phase space satisfying present observational data, and solving the coincidence problem. In a specific region of parameters, a sequence of critical points is achieved exhibiting a unified cosmic evolution of the universe starting from early inflation (source point), which is followed by a decelerated intermediate phase (saddle solution), and finally goes through the late-time dark energy dominated universe (stable point). Finally, non-singular bouncing behavior of the universe is also investigated for this model numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thin disk and shadow of Kerr-Sen black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity. The results reveal that as the dilaton parameter $r_2$ increase, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectra luminosity, and the radiative efficiency of the disk all increase. By narrowing down the dilaton parameter range to $0\leqslant \frac{r_2}{M}\leqslant0.4$, we discover that in the high-frequency region, the Kerr-Sen black hole demonstrates higher energy output compared to the Kerr black hole. We also investigated the shadow of Kerr-Sen black hole in a uniform plasma environment. For fixed inclination angle, dilaton, and spin parameters, the shadow increases as the homogeneous plasma parameter $k$ increases. Conversely, when $k $ and $a$ are fixed, an increase in $r_2$ leads to a decrease in the shadow. Finally, we constrain the model parameters with observational data from M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe does not obey Landauer's principle for efficient information erasure. This is in contrast to what happens for black holes, where the principle is upheld exactly. We discuss about the implications this result provides for the differences between information loss at black holes and that at the cosmological apparent horizon, which we term the "Cosmological Information Paradox". We also discuss how this result may point towards incompleteness of quasi-local descriptions of energy and could also point towards different thermodynamic settings in gravitational systems and how information thermodynamics as we know it may have limits to its applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study Einstein-bumblebee gravity theory minimally coupled with external matter -- a phantom/non-phantom(conventional) scalar field, and derive a series of hairy solutions -- bumblebee-phantom(BP) and BP-dS/AdS black hole solutions, regular Ellis-bumblebee-phantom (EBP) and BP-AdS wormholes, etc. We first find that the Lorentz violation (LV) effect can change the so called black hole no-hair theorem and these scalar fields can give a hair to a black hole. If LV coupling constant $\ell&gt;-1$, the phantom field is admissible and the conventional scalar field is forbidden; if $\ell&lt;-1$, the phantom field is forbidden and the conventional scalar field is admissible. By defining the Killing potential $\omega^{ab}$, we study the Smarr formula and the first law for the BP black hole, find that the appearance of LV can improve the structure of these phantom hairy black holes -- the conventional Smarr formula and the first law of black hole thermodynamics still hold; but for no LV case, i.e., the regular phantom black hole reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf96}, 251101], the first law cannot be constructed at all. When the bumblebee potential is linear, we find that the phantom potential and the Lagrange-multiplier $\lambda$ behave as a cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin for the compaction function for primordial black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole (PBH) formation at least during radiation domination. In the long-wavelength limit, we identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric and this explains why it cannot be greater than $1/2$. The maximum value of $1/2$ corresponds to an extremal surface, which is simultaneously a bifurcating trapping horizon and admits a circular photon orbit in the static spacetime. In the long-wavelength regime of the physical expanding universe, we discover that the Shibata-Sasaki compaction reaches its maximum value of $1/2$ at maximal and minimal surfaces on the constant-time spacelike hypersurface, which feature a type II perturbation and both correspond to photon spheres expanding along with the cosmological expansion. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction measures how close to the type II configuration the positively curved region is.</description>

Abstract: We solve the gravitational field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime within the framework of the symmetric teleparallel theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive new solutions within the context of power-law $f(Q)$ gravity and the nonmetricity scalar-tensor theory. For the connection in the non-coincidence gauge, we present the point-like Lagrangian that describes the employed field equations. Furthermore, we construct two conservation laws, and for different values of these conserved quantities, we analytically solve the gravitational field equations. New solutions are obtained, we investigate their physical properties and their general relativistic limit. Finally, we discuss the algebraic properties for the derived spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Thermogeometric Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a finite-time geometric optimization framework to analyze thermal fluctuations and optimal processes in black holes. Our approach implement geodesics in thermodynamic space to define optimal pathways between equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Since thermodynamic metrics need not be positive definite, the method ensures a positive thermodynamic length by incorporating simple scale factor into the metric. We show that the thermodynamic length and the scale factor are sensitive to phase transitions in entropy representation, addressing a key gap in Hessian thermodynamic geometry. Additionally, we link the scale factor to the sign of thermodynamic curvature, connecting it to the information geometry governing optimal processes. Our results indicate that optimal fluctuations can drive the evaporation of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, which may significantly differ from Hawking radiation. We also explore optimal accretion-driven processes supported by an external inflow of energy.</description>

Abstract: The path-integral of 4D Einstein-Hilbert gravity for deSitter like Universe with fluctuations is investigated, and the transition amplitude from one boundary configuration to another is computed. The gravitational system is described by lapse, scale-factor and metric-fluctuation field. Variational consistency demands augmenting the bulk theory with suitable boundary action. A given boundary choice on scale-factor is seen to be achievable via an infinite family of covariant boundary actions, each restricting the boundary choices for the fluctuation field. General covariance intimately ties the two boundary choices, which no longer can be chosen independently. In the absence of back-reaction, the gauge-fixed gravitational path-integral disintegrates into path-integral over scale-factor and metric-fluctuation field, connected only via lapse. While the former is exactly doable, the latter is computed up to one loop via mode decomposition, leading to one loop quantum-corrected lapse action. ``No-boundary'' saddles of the theory without metric perturbations are no longer the saddles of the one-loop corrected action. The quantum-corrected saddles have the Universe starting from a non-zero size. Ultraviolet (UV)-divergences are systematically extracted from the one-loop lapse action and then regularized by adding suitable counter-terms. UV-finite lapse action is then utilized for computing finite transition amplitude. Contributions from virtual gravitons to the transition amplitude are isolated by considering vanishing metric fluctuations at boundaries. These contributions are seen to be secularly growing with Universe size, leading to infrared divergent transition amplitude.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violation alleviates gravitationally induced entanglement degradation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz violation is a significant phenomenon in the framework of quantum physics, with implications for fundamental symmetries. In this paper, we explore the effects of Lorentz violation on quantum entanglement through a black hole spacetime that is coupled with a Lorentz-violating field. We establish the relationship between the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state and the Boulware number states for this case, and employ the near horizon approximation in an appropriate form to rewrite the black hole metric into a Rindler-like form. Subsequently, using this revised metric, the analytical forms of logarithmic negativity and mutual information are derived and plotted as functions of Rob's distance from the $ r=0 $ point. Based on the results, we find that the coupling between spacetime and the Lorentz-violating vector field alleviates gravity-induced entanglement degradation. At high mode frequencies, the effects of Lorentz violation are negligible, but they become significant at low frequencies. This suggests that investigating Lorentz violation at astrophysical scales requires low-frequency detectors, as the low energy of these fields enhances the significance of the Lorentz-violating field's non-zero vacuum expectation value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around a spherically symmetric regular black hole, whose metric is derived from a non-singular collapsing dust ball model in asymptotically safe gravity. In this regular black hole spacetime, we obtain the analytical expression of the light deflection angle via calculating the strong field limit coefficients, and then evaluate the lensing observables in strong field regime by supposing the regular black holes as the candidate of $M87^*$ and $SgrA*$ supermassive black holes, respectively. In addition, we also in detail analyze the effects of the scale parameter $\xi$ on the strong deflection angle and the lensing observables. We expect our results will be useful in the future to distinguish these non-singular black holes from their classical singular counterparts.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes from thin-shell collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that regular black holes can form from gravitational collapse. Our model builds on a recent construction that realized regular black holes as exact solutions to purely gravitational theories that incorporate an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections in any dimension $D \ge 5$ [arXiv:2403.04827]. We identify a two-dimensional Horndeski theory that captures the spherically symmetric dynamics of the theories in question and use this to prove a Birkhoff theorem and obtain the generalized Israel junction conditions. Armed with these tools, we consider the collapse of thin shells of pressureless matter, showing that this leads generically to the formation of regular black holes. The interior dynamics we uncover is intricate, consisting of shell bounces and white hole explosions into a new universe. The result is that regular black holes are the unique spherically symmetric solutions of the corresponding theories and also the endpoint of gravitational collapse of matter. Along the way, we establish evidence for a solution-independent upper bound on the curvature, suggestive of Markov's limiting curvature hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Regular Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dynamical gravitational collapse in a theory with an infinite tower of higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action and we show that, under very general conditions, it leads to the formation of regular black holes. Our results are facilitated by the use of a class of theories that possess second-order equations on spherically symmetric metrics, but which are general enough to provide a basis for the gravitational effective action. We analytically solve the collapse of a thin shell of dust and show that it inevitably experiences a bounce at small radius and that its motion can be extended to arbitrary proper time. The collapse of the shell always gives rise to a singularity-free, geodesically complete spacetime that contains horizons if the total mass is above a critical value. In that case, the shell bounces into a new universe through a white hole explosion. Our construction provides, to the best of our knowlege, the first fully dynamical description of formation of regular black holes, and it suggests that higher-derivative corrections may be the most natural way to resolve the singularities of Einstein's theory.</description>

Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedman cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-big-bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance Breaking in Gravity and Cosmological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breaking diffeomorphism invariance has been motivated in the literature in several contexts, including emergent General Relativity (GR). For this to be an admissible possibility, GR augmented with minor violations of general covariance must yield only slight deviations from the outcomes of GR. In this paper, the cosmological evolution of the scale factor in gravity with explicitly broken general covariance is investigated in the (modified) Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. The model augments the GR Lagrangian with all of the diffeomorphism-breaking (but Lorentz invariant) terms in the leading order, the terms involving two derivatives. The magnitudes of (minor) violations are kept general modulo the conditions for a healthy linearized version of the model. The analytic solutions of the scale factor in the full non-linear theory for the single-component universes are attempted; the radiation and vacuum solutions are found analytically, whereas the matter solution is worked out numerically since an analytic solution does not exist in the required form. It is observed that the solutions smoothly connect to those of GR in the limit of vanishing symmetry-breaking. The more realistic, two-component, and three-component universes are numerically studied, and no sign of unhealthy behavior is observed: minor diffeomorphism violating modifications to GR do not cause instabilities in the evolution of the scale factor.</description>

      <title>Observational Features of Thin Accretion Disk Around Rotating Regular Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating regular black hole, as a promising extension beyond general relativity, offer a phenomenological model that resolves spacetime singularities. In this study, we investigate the observational features of thin accretion disk around a well-known rotating regular black hole, which introduce an exponential converge factor $e^{-k/r}$ to the black hole mass M, where $k$ is the regular parameter. By studying the effects of the regular parameter on key quantities such as energy, angular momentum, and the innermost stable circular orbits of a test particle, we are able to analyze the radiative flux, temperature, and differential luminosity of the thin accretion disk in this rotation regular black hole spacetime. By using the ray-tracing method, we also obtain the bolometric images of thin accretion disk around this rotating regular black hole, with various black hole spins and inclination angels. Our results show that the regular parameter significantly impacts the observables, enhancing the radiation efficiency of thin accretion disk and contracting the lensing bands of black hole image, compared to Kerr black hole. These effects become more pronounced for rapidly rotating regular black hole and large inclination angels, making them more detectable in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Path integral derivation of the thermofield double state in causal diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we adopt the framework developed by R. Laflamme in \textit{Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pp. 58-63 (1989) to analyze the path integral of a massless -- conformally invariant -- scalar field defined on a causal diamond of size $2\alpha$ in 1+1 dimensions. By examining the Euclidean geometry of the causal diamond, we establish that its structure is conformally related to the cylinder $S^{1}_{\beta} \otimes \mathbb{R}$, where the Euclidean time coordinate $\tau$ has a periodicity of $\beta$. This property, along with the conformal symmetry of the fields, allows us to identify the connection between the thermofield double (TFD) state of causal diamonds and the Euclidean path integral defined on the two disconnected manifolds of the cylinder. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the temperature of the TFD state, derived from the conditions in the Euclidean geometry and analytically calculated, coincides with the temperature of the causal diamond known in the literature. This derivation highlights the universality of the connection between the Euclidean path integral formalism and the TFD state of the causal diamond, as well as it further establishes causal diamonds as a model that exhibits all desired properties of a system exhibiting the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: We consider the covariant proposal for the gravitational Compton amplitude for a Kerr black hole. Employing the covariant three- and four-point Compton amplitudes, we assemble the classical one-loop integrand on the maximal cut at all orders in spin, utilizing the method of unitarity. Expanding in powers of spin, we evaluate the one-loop amplitude up to $\mathcal O(G^2 a^8)$. Supplemented with extra contact contributions derived from the far-zone data of the Teukolsky solutions, the one-loop amplitude is in agreement with results available in the literature. We showcase the classical eikonal in the aligned-spin case at $\mathcal O(G^2 a^7)$.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band (e.g., $\sim 3-45$ detectable stellar-mass binary black holes with $e&gt;0.9$ in the Milky Way), with their GW signals characterized by "repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital orientation may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of "bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

We calculate the entropy, mass and angular momentum of warped anti-de Sitter (WAdS$_3$) black holes in ghost-free BHT massive gravity and its extension using the covariant phase space method. We also compute the central charges of the dual boundary conformal field theories (CFT) from the thermodynamics method.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>
