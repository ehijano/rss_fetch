      <title>The mass of $^{101}$Sn and Bayesian extrapolations to the proton drip line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The favorable energy configurations of nuclei at magic numbers of ${N}$ neutrons and ${Z}$ protons are fundamental for understanding the evolution of nuclear structure. The ${Z=50}$ (tin) isotopic chain is a frontier for such studies, with particular interest in nuclear binding at and around the doubly-magic \textsuperscript{100}Sn isotope. Precise mass measurements of neutron-deficient isotopes provide necessary anchor points for mass models to test extrapolations near the proton drip line, where experimental studies currently remain out of reach. In this work, we report the first Penning trap mass measurement of \textsuperscript{101}Sn. The determined mass excess of $-59\,889.89(96)$~keV for \textsuperscript{101}Sn represents a factor of 300 improvement over the current precision and indicates that \textsuperscript{101}Sn is less bound than previously thought. Mass predictions from a recently developed Bayesian model combination (BMC) framework employing statistical machine learning and nuclear masses computed within seven global models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory (DFT) agree within 1$\sigma$ with experimental masses from the $48 \le Z \le 52$ isotopic chains. This provides confidence in the extrapolation of tin masses down to $N=46$.</description>

      <title>Stellar s-process neutron capture cross sections on A-Se and A-Ce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on experiments at the Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility - Liquid-Lithium Target (SARAF-LiLiT) laboratory dedicated to the study of s-process neutron capture reactions. The kW-power proton beam at 1.92 MeV (1-2 mA) from SARAF Phase I yields high-intensity 30 keV quasi-Maxwellian neutrons (3-5x10^10 n/s). The high neutron intensity enables Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) measurements of samples with short-lived decay products. Neutron capture reactions on nat-Se and nat-Ce were investigated by activation in the LiLiT neutron beam and {\gamma}-spectrometry measurements of their decay products.</description>

      <title>Method to search for the triple-neutron state in an electron scattering experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electron scattering experiment to search for the trineutron state $^3n$ by reaction ${\rm ^4He}(e,~e'p\pi^{+})^{3}n$ is designed for the A1 facility at Mainzer Microtron. The detailed principles, setup, and simulation of this experiment are presented. With the momenta of the scattered electron, the produced proton and $\pi^+$ from the reaction measured by three spectrometers with their triple coincidence, the missing mass spectrum of $^3n$ can be obtained. The production rate of $^3n$ based on the cross section of the reaction and a MC simulation is estimated to be about 1.5 per day, which can provide a confidence level of the signal greater than 5$\sigma$ with a beam time longer than 16 days. According to a MC simulation that evaluates the energy losses of particles in materials and the performance of three spectrometers, the estimated resolution and the predicted shape of the missing mass spectrum are presented. This work provides a new experimental concept for the search for multineutron states in future experiments with an electron beam.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the mass resolving power of FRIB's proposed high-voltage MR-ToF mass separator and spectrometer: addressing non-ideal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separators and spectrometers (MR-ToF MSs) are indispensable tools at radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities. These electrostatic ion beam traps act as highly selective mass separators and high-precision mass spectrometers for rare and exotic nuclei. When well-tuned and designed to minimize higher-order flight-time aberrations, state-of-the-art MR-ToF MSs approach, and slightly exceed, mass resolving powers of \( m / \Delta m = 10^6 \). Achieving \( m / \Delta m &gt; 3 \cdot 10^6 \) would provide the ability to resolve \( &gt;90\% \) of all known isomeric states with half-lives above 10~\text{ms}. However, the ability to mass separate in all practical setups is limited by non-ideal conditions which place such resolving powers out of reach. To this end, we present a simulated analysis of these conditions in the newly proposed high-voltage MR-ToF MS for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). It is expected to store ions at 30~\text{keV} beam energy and increase ion throughput by two orders of magnitude compared to current devices. Existing efforts to mitigate the effects of non-ideal conditions employed for current MR-ToF devices storing ions at \( &lt;3~\text{keV} \) beam energy will already enable mass resolving powers approaching \( 10^6 \) for FRIB's high-voltage MR-ToF device. Simulations of newly proposed mitigation strategies show that even mass resolving powers approaching \( 10^7 \) might become feasible.</description>

      <title>Dynamical coupled-channel models for hadron dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>

      <title>In-pixel integration of signal processing and AI/ML based data filtering for particle tracking detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first physical realization of in-pixel signal processing with integrated AI-based data filtering for particle tracking detectors. Building on prior work that demonstrated a physics-motivated edge-AI algorithm suitable for ASIC implementation, this work marks a significant milestone toward intelligent silicon trackers. Our prototype readout chip performs real-time data reduction at the sensor level while meeting stringent requirements on power, area, and latency. The chip is taped-out in 28nm TSMC CMOS bulk process, which has been shown to have sufficient radiation hardness for particle experiments. This development represents a key step toward enabling fully on-detector edge AI, with broad implications for data throughput and discovery potential in high-rate, high-radiation environments such as the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>
