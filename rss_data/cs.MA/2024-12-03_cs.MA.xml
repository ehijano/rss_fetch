      <title>Neural Power-Optimal Magnetorquer Solution for Multi-Agent Formation and Attitude Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient algorithm for finding the power-optimal currents of magnetorquer, a satellite attitude actuator in Earth orbit, for multi-agent formation and attitude control. Specifically, this study demonstrates that a set of power-optimal solutions can be derived through sequential convex programming and proposes a method to approximate these solutions using a deep neural network (DNN). The practicality of this DNN model is demonstrated through numerical simulations of formation and attitude control.</description>

      <title>Streamlining the Action Dependency Graph Framework: Two Key Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is critical for coordinating multiple robots in shared environments, yet robust execution of generated plans remains challenging due to operational uncertainties. The Action Dependency Graph (ADG) framework offers a way to ensure correct action execution by establishing precedence-based dependencies between wait and move actions retrieved from a MAPF planning result. The original construction algorithm is not only inefficient, with a quadratic worst-case time complexity it also results in a network with many redundant dependencies between actions. This paper introduces two key improvements to the ADG framework. First, we prove that wait actions are generally redundant and show that removing them can lead to faster overall plan execution on real robot systems. Second, we propose an optimized ADG construction algorithm, termed Sparse Candidate Partitioning (SCP), which skips unnecessary dependencies and lowers the time complexity to quasi-linear, thereby significantly improving construction speed.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamic Under Malicious Agent Influence in Multi-Agent Systems: From the Perspective of Opinion Evolution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human social systems, debates are often seen as a means to resolve differences of opinion. However, in reality, debates frequently incur significant communication costs, especially when dealing with stubborn opponents. Inspired by this phenomenon, this paper examines the impact of malicious agents on the evolution of normal agents' opinions from the perspective of opinion evolution cost, and proposes corresponding solutions for the scenario in which malicious agents hold different opinions in multi-agent systems(MASs). First, the paper analyzes the negative impact of malicious agents on the opinion evolution process, revealing the evolutionary cost they bring, which provides the theoretical foundation for the proposed solution. Next, based on the process of opinion evolution, a strategy is introduced where agents dynamically adjust trust values during the opinion evolution process, gradually isolating malicious agents and achieving this even when malicious agents are in the majority. Additionally, an evolution rate adjustment mechanism is introduced, allowing the system to flexibly regulate the evolution process in complex situations, effectively achieving the trade-off between opinion evolution rate and cost. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively isolate the negative influence of malicious agents and achieve a balance between opinion evolution costs and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>An AI-Driven Data Mesh Architecture Enhancing Decision-Making in Infrastructure Construction and Public Procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure construction, often dubbed an "industry of industries," is closely linked with government spending and public procurement, offering significant opportunities for improved efficiency and productivity through better transparency and information access. By leveraging these opportunities, we can achieve notable gains in productivity, cost savings, and broader economic benefits. Our approach introduces an integrated software ecosystem utilizing Data Mesh and Service Mesh architectures. This system includes the largest training dataset for infrastructure and procurement, encompassing over 100 billion tokens, scientific publications, activities, and risk data, all structured by a systematic AI framework. Supported by a Knowledge Graph linked to domain-specific multi-agent tasks and Q&amp;A capabilities, our platform standardizes and ingests diverse data sources, transforming them into structured knowledge. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and automation, our system revolutionizes data structuring and knowledge creation, aiding decision-making in early-stage project planning, detailed research, market trend analysis, and qualitative assessments. Its web-scalable architecture delivers domain-curated information, enabling AI agents to facilitate reasoning and manage uncertainties, while preparing for future expansions with specialized agents targeting particular challenges. This integration of AI with domain expertise not only boosts efficiency and decision-making in construction and infrastructure but also establishes a framework for enhancing government efficiency and accelerating the transition of traditional industries to digital workflows. This work is poised to significantly influence AI-driven initiatives in this sector and guide best practices in AI Operations.</description>

      <title>Towards Fault Tolerance in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent faults pose a significant threat to the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, introducing two key challenges. First, agents often struggle to extract critical information from the chaotic state space created by unexpected faults. Second, transitions recorded before and after faults in the replay buffer affect training unevenly, leading to a sample imbalance problem. To overcome these challenges, this paper enhances the fault tolerance of MARL by combining optimized model architecture with a tailored training data sampling strategy. Specifically, an attention mechanism is incorporated into the actor and critic networks to automatically detect faults and dynamically regulate the attention given to faulty agents. Additionally, a prioritization mechanism is introduced to selectively sample transitions critical to current training needs. To further support research in this area, we design and open-source a highly decoupled code platform for fault-tolerant MARL, aimed at improving the efficiency of studying related problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in handling various types of faults, faults occurring in any agent, and faults arising at random times.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging due to the fact that the size of the joint state and action spaces are exponentially large in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm \texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ} (\textbf{Subsample}-\textbf{M}ean-\textbf{F}ield-\textbf{Q}-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm system learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy in the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We validate our method empirically on Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.</description>

      <title>Inferring Short-Sightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, which specifies the degree to which all agents care about the distant future. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in their degree of short-sightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's short-sightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters in order to solve for agents' short-sightedness. We conduct several experiments simulating human behavior at a real-world crosswalk. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that by explicitly inferring agents' short-sightedness, we can recover more accurate game-theoretic models, which ultimately allow us to make better predictions of agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show up to a 30% more accurate prediction of myopic behavior compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>STLGame: Signal Temporal Logic Games in Adversarial Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to synthesize a robust and safe policy for autonomous systems under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks in adversarial settings against unknown dynamic agents. To ensure the worst-case STL satisfaction, we propose STLGame, a framework that models the multi-agent system as a two-player zero-sum game, where the ego agents try to maximize the STL satisfaction and other agents minimize it. STLGame aims to find a Nash equilibrium policy profile, which is the best case in terms of robustness against unseen opponent policies, by using the fictitious self-play (FSP) framework. FSP iteratively converges to a Nash profile, even in games set in continuous state-action spaces. We propose a gradient-based method with differentiable STL formulas, which is crucial in continuous settings to approximate the best responses at each iteration of FSP. We show this key aspect experimentally by comparing with reinforcement learning-based methods to find the best response. Experiments on two standard dynamical system benchmarks, Ackermann steering vehicles and autonomous drones, demonstrate that our converged policy is almost unexploitable and robust to various unseen opponents' policies. All code and additional experimental results can be found on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/stlgame</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Message-Passing and Zeroth-Order Optimization Based Distributed Learning with a Use-Case in Resource Allocation in Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing. While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning over graphs), focus on optimizing either local costs or a global cost, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common task (i.e., optimizing a global cost equal to aggregated local costs) while effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local parameters in a local cost). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., cost function value) and shares scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.</description>

      <title>Inferring Latent Temporal Sparse Coordination Graph for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective agent coordination is crucial in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). While agent cooperation can be represented by graph structures, prevailing graph learning methods in MARL are limited. They rely solely on one-step observations, neglecting crucial historical experiences, leading to deficient graphs that foster redundant or detrimental information exchanges. Additionally, high computational demands for action-pair calculations in dense graphs impede scalability. To address these challenges, we propose inferring a Latent Temporal Sparse Coordination Graph (LTS-CG) for MARL. The LTS-CG leverages agents' historical observations to calculate an agent-pair probability matrix, where a sparse graph is sampled from and used for knowledge exchange between agents, thereby simultaneously capturing agent dependencies and relation uncertainty. The computational complexity of this procedure is only related to the number of agents. This graph learning process is further augmented by two innovative characteristics: Predict-Future, which enables agents to foresee upcoming observations, and Infer-Present, ensuring a thorough grasp of the environmental context from limited data. These features allow LTS-CG to construct temporal graphs from historical and real-time information, promoting knowledge exchange during policy learning and effective collaboration. Graph learning and agent training occur simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. Our demonstrated results on the StarCraft II benchmark underscore LTS-CG's superior performance.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes that each agent assigns a constant competition weight to its initial opinion. In contrast, we investigate the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We prove that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We study this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. Further, if competition is not uniform across agents, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate our analytical insights numerically.</description>

      <title>FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Bias in Queer Representation within Large Language Models: A Collaborative Agent Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often perpetuate biases in pronoun usage, leading to misrepresentation or exclusion of queer individuals. This paper addresses the specific problem of biased pronoun usage in LLM outputs, particularly the inappropriate use of traditionally gendered pronouns ("he," "she") when inclusive language is needed to accurately represent all identities. We introduce a collaborative agent pipeline designed to mitigate these biases by analyzing and optimizing pronoun usage for inclusivity. Our multi-agent framework includes specialized agents for both bias detection and correction. Experimental evaluations using the Tango dataset-a benchmark focused on gender pronoun usage-demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inclusive pronoun classification, achieving a 32.6 percentage point increase over GPT-4o in correctly disagreeing with inappropriate traditionally gendered pronouns $(\chi^2 = 38.57, p &lt; 0.0001)$. These results accentuate the potential of agent-driven frameworks in enhancing fairness and inclusivity in AI-generated content, demonstrating their efficacy in reducing biases and promoting socially responsible AI.</description>

      <title>InvestESG: A multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark for studying climate investment as a social dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InvestESG is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. Supported by both PyTorch and JAX implementation, the benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions, in a scalable and hardware-accelerated manner. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability.
