      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Leiptr Stellar Stream: A Disrupted Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical abundances of stellar streams can be used to determine the nature of a stream's progenitor. Here we study the progenitor of the recently discovered Leiptr stellar stream, which was previously suggested to be a tidally disrupted halo globular cluster. We obtain high-resolution spectra of five red giant branch stars selected from the Gaia DR2 STREAMFINDER catalog with Magellan/MIKE. One star is a clear non-member. The remaining four stars display chemical abundances consistent with those of a low-mass dwarf galaxy: they have a low mean metallicity, $\langle{\rm[Fe/H]}\rangle = -2.2$; they do not all have identical metallicities; and they display low [$\alpha$/Fe] $\sim 0$ and [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] $\sim -1$. This pattern of low $\alpha$ and neutron-capture element abundances is only found in intact dwarf galaxies with stellar mass $\lesssim 10^5 M_\odot$. Although more data are needed to be certain, Leiptr's chemistry is consistent with being the lowest-mass dwarf galaxy stream without a known intact progenitor, possibly in the mass range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Leiptr thus preserves a record of one of the lowest-mass early accretion events into the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ III: Constraining the 3-D structure of the Central Molecular Zone via molecular line emission and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest concentration of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy, the structure of which is shaped by the complex interplay between Galactic-scale dynamics and extreme physical conditions. Understanding the 3-D geometry of this gas is crucial as it determines the locations of star formation and subsequent feedback. We present a catalogue of clouds in the CMZ using Herschel data. Using archival data from the APEX and MOPRA CMZ surveys, we measure averaged kinematic properties of the clouds at 1mm and 3mm. We use archival ATCA data of the H$_{2}$CO (1$_{1,0}$ - 1$_{1,1}$) 4.8 GHz line to search for absorption towards the clouds, and 4.85 GHz GBT C-band data to measure the radio continuum emission. We measure the absorption against the continuum to provide new constraints for the line-of-sight positions of the clouds relative to the Galactic centre, and find a highly asymmetric distribution, with most clouds residing in front of the Galactic centre. The results are compared with different orbital models, and we introduce a revised toy model of a vertically-oscillating closed elliptical orbit. We find that most models describe the PPV structure of the gas reasonably well, but find significant inconsistencies in all cases regarding the near vs. far placement of individual clouds. Our results highlight that the CMZ is likely more complex than can be captured by these simple geometric models, along with the need for new data to provide further constraints on the true 3-D structure of the CMZ.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ IV: Distinguishing Near vs. Far Distances in the Galactic Center Using Spitzer and Herschel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive 3-D model of the central 300 pc of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is of fundamental importance in understanding energy cycles in galactic nuclei, since the 3-D structure influences the location and intensity of star formation, feedback, and black hole accretion. Current observational constraints are insufficient to distinguish between existing 3-D models. Dust extinction is one diagnostic tool that can help determine the location of dark molecular clouds relative to the bright Galactic Center emission. By combining Herschel and Spitzer observations, we developed three new dust extinction techniques to estimate the likely near/far locations for each cloud in the CMZ. We compare our results to four geometric CMZ orbital models. Our extinction methods show good agreement with each other, and with results from spectral line absorption analysis from Walker et al. (submitted). Our near/far results for CMZ clouds are inconsistent with a projected version of the Sofue (1995) two spiral arms model, and show disagreement in position-velocity space with the Molinari et al. (2011) closed elliptical orbit. Our results are in reasonable agreement with the Kruijssen et al. (2015) open streams. We find that a simplified toy-model elliptical orbit which conserves angular momentum shows promising fits in both position-position and position-velocity space. We conclude that all current CMZ orbital models lack the complexity needed to describe the motion of gas in the CMZ, and further work is needed to construct a complex orbital model to accurately describe gas flows in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Properties of black hole-star binaries formed in $N$-body simulations of massive star clusters: implications for Gaia black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black hole-star binaries formed in $N$-body simulations of massive, dense star clusters. We simulate 32 clusters with varying initial masses ($10^{4}~\rm M_{\odot}$ to $10^{6}~\rm M_{\odot}$), densities ($1200~\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-3}$ to $10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-3}$), and metallicities $(Z = 0.01,~0.001,~0.0001)$. Our results reveal that star clusters produce a diverse range of BH-star binaries, with dynamical interactions leading to extreme systems characterised by large orbital separations and high black hole masses. Of the ejected BH-main sequence (BH-MS) binaries, $20\%$ form dynamically, while the rest originate from the primordial binary population initially present in the cluster. Ejected BH-MS binaries that are dynamically formed have more massive black holes, lower-mass stellar companions, and over half are in a hierarchical triple system. All unbound BH-giant star (BH-GS) binaries were ejected as BH-MS binaries and evolved into the BH-GS phase outside the cluster. Due to their lower-mass companions, most dynamically formed binaries do not evolve into BH-GS systems within a Hubble time. Consequently, only 2 of the 35 ejected BH-GS binaries are dynamically formed. We explore the formation pathways of Gaia-like systems, identifying two Gaia BH1-like binaries that formed through dynamical interactions, and two Gaia BH2-like systems with a primordial origin. We did not find any system resembling Gaia BH3, which may however be attributed to the limited sample size of our simulations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the radial ISM metallicity gradient in the Milky Way disk since redshift $\approx 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works identified a way to recover the time evolution of a galaxy's disk metallicity gradient from the shape of its age--metallicity relation. However, the success of the method is dependent on how the width of the star-forming region evolves over time, which in turn is dependent on a galaxy's present-day bar strength. In this paper, we account for the time variation in the width of the star-forming region when deriving the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient evolution over time ($\rm \nabla [Fe/H](\tau)$), which provides more realistic birth radii estimates of Milky Way (MW) disk stars. Using MW/Andromeda analogues from the TNG50 simulation, we quantified the disk growth of newly born stars as a function of present-day bar strength to provide a correction that improves recovery of $\rm \nabla [Fe/H](\tau)$. In TNG50, we find that our correction reduces the median absolute error in recovering $\rm \nabla [Fe/H] (\tau)$ by over 30%. To confirm its universality, we test our correction on two galaxies from NIHAO-UHD and find the median absolute error is over 3 times smaller even in the presence of observational uncertainties for the barred, MW-like galaxy. Applying our correction to APOGEE DR17 red giant MW disk stars suggests the effects of merger events on $\rm \nabla [Fe/H](\tau)$ are less significant than originally found, and the corresponding estimated birth radii expose epochs when different migration mechanisms dominated. Our correction to account for the growth of the star-forming region in the disk allows for better recovery of the evolution of the MW disk's ISM metallicity gradient and, thus, more meaningful stellar birth radii estimates. With our results, we are able to suggest the evolution of not only the ISM gradient, but also the total stellar disk radial metallicity gradient, providing key constraints to select MW analogues across redshift.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the properties of UV upturn galaxies in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UV upturn refers to the increase in UV flux at wavelengths shorter than 3000 {\AA} observed in quiescent early-type galaxies (ETGs), which still remains a puzzle. In this study, we aim to identify ETGs showing the UV upturn phenomenon within the Virgo galaxy cluster. We utilized a color-color diagram to identify all potential possible UV upturn galaxies. The Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) of these galaxies were then analyzed using the CIGALE software; we confirmed the presence of UV upturn in galaxies within the Virgo cluster. We found that the SED fitting method is the best tool to visualize and confirm the UV upturn phenomenon in ETGs. Our findings reveal that the population distributions regarding stellar mass and star formation rate properties are similar between UV upturn and red sequence galaxies. We suggest that the UV contribution originates from old stellar populations and can be modeled effectively without a burst model. Moreover, by estimating the temperature of the stellar population responsible for the UV emission, we determined it to be 13,000 K to 18,000 K. These temperature estimates support the notion that the UV upturn likely arises from the contribution of low mass evolved stellar populations (extreme horizontal branch stars). Furthermore, the Mg2 index, a metallicity indicator, in the confirmed upturn galaxies shows higher strength and follows a similar trend to previous studies. This study sheds light on the nature of UV upturn galaxies within the Virgo cluster and provides evidence that low-mass evolved stellar populations are the possible mechanisms driving the UV upturn phenomenon.</description>

      <title>[CII] line intensity mapping the epoch of reionization with the Prime-Cam on FYST II. CO foreground masking based on an external catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) line intensity mapping (LIM) survey will measure the power spectrum (PS) of the singly ionized carbon 158 $\rm \mu$m fine-structure line, [CII], to trace the appearance of the first galaxies that emerged during and right after the epoch of reionization (EoR, $6&lt;z&lt;9$).
  Aims. We aim to quantify the contamination of the (post-)EoR [CII] LIM signal by foreground carbon monoxide (CO) line emission ($3 &lt; J_{ \rm up} &lt; 12$) and assess the efficiency to retrieve this [CII] LIM signal by the targeted masking of bright CO emitters.
  Methods. Using the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, we produced mock CO intensity tomographies based on empirical star formation rate-to-CO luminosity relations. Combining these predictions with the [CII] PS predictions of the first paper of this series, we evaluated a masking technique where the interlopers are identified and masked using an external catalog whose properties are equivalent to those of a deep Euclid survey.
  Results. Prior to masking, our [CII] PS forecast is an order of magnitude lower than the predicted CO contamination in the 225 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=6.8-8.3$) band of the FYST LIM survey, at the same level in its 280 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=5.3-6.3$) and 350 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=4.1-4.8$) bands, and an order of magnitude higher in its 410 GHz ([CII] emitted at $z=3.4-3.9$) band. For our fiducial model, the optimal masking depth is reached when less than 10\% of the survey volume is masked at 350 and 410 GHz but around 40\% at 280 GHz and 60 \% at 225 GHz. At these masking depths we anticipate a detection of the [CII] PS at 350 and 410 GHz, a tentative detection at 280 GHz, whereas at 225 GHz the CO signal still dominates our model. In the last case, alternative decontamination techniques will be needed.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ II: Hierarchical Structure Analysis of the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the way station at the heart of our Milky Way Galaxy, connecting gas flowing in from Galactic scales with the central nucleus. Key open questions remain about its 3-D structure, star formation properties, and role in regulating this gas inflow. In this work, we identify a hierarchy of discrete structures in the CMZ using column density and dust temperature maps from Paper I (Battersby et al., submitted). We calculate the physical ($N$(H$_2$), $T_{\rm{dust}}$, mass, radius) and kinematic (HNCO, HCN, and HC$_3$N moments) properties of each structure as well as their bolometric luminosities and star formation rates (SFRs). We compare these properties with regions in the Milky Way disk and external galaxies. We perform power-law fits to the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) of the inner 100 pc, SgrB2, and the outer 100 pc of the CMZ as well as several individual molecular cloud structures and find generally steeper power-law slopes ($-9&lt;\alpha&lt;-2$) compared with the literature ($-6 &lt; \alpha &lt; -1$). We find that individual CMZ structures require a large external pressure ($P_e$/k$_B$ $&gt; 10^{7-9}$ K cm$^{-3}$) to be considered bound. Despite the fact that the CMZ overall is well below the Gao-Solomon dense gas star-formation relation (and in modest agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation), individual structures on the scale of molecular clouds generally follow these star-formation relations and agree well with other Milky Way and extragalactic regions.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ I: Central Molecular Zone Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40\deg($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $&gt; 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40\deg ($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8\deg $&gt; \ell &gt;$ -1.3\deg. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT.</description>

      <title>A 3D Model of the Local Bubble's Magnetic Field: Insights from Dust and Starlight Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustered stellar feedback creates expanding voids in the magnetized interstellar medium known as superbubbles. Although theory suggests that superbubble expansion is influenced by interstellar magnetic fields, direct observational data on 3D superbubble magnetic field geometry is limited. The Sun's location inside the Local Bubble provides a unique opportunity to infer a superbubble's 3D magnetic field orientation, under the assumptions that: $\mathrm{I}$) the Local Bubble's surface is the primary contributor to plane-of-the-sky polarization observations across much of the sky, and $\mathrm{II}$) the Local Bubble's magnetic field is tangent to its dust-traced shell. In this work, we validate these assumptions and construct a model of the Local Bubble's 3D B-field orientation from $\textit{Planck}$ 353 GHz polarization observations and a 3D-dust-derived model of the Local Bubble's shell. We test Assumption $\mathrm{I}$ by examining correlations between the Local Bubble's 3D geometry, dust polarization, and starlight polarization. We find that the Local Bubble likely dominates the polarized signal in the majority of lines of sight. We jointly test Assumptions $\mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{II}$ by applying our reconstruction method to a simulated superbubble, where we successfully reconstruct the 3D magnetic field orientation over the bulk of its surface. Finally, we use our 3D B-field model to infer the initial magnetic field orientation in the solar neighborhood prior to the Local Bubble's formation, and derive an orientation parallel to the present-day Local Arm of the galaxy. These findings provide new insights into the co-evolution of superbubbles and the magnetized interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Generalized $T_e$([OIII])-$T_e$(HeI) Discrepancies in Ionized Nebulae: Possible Evidence of Case B Deviations and Temperature Inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of recombination lines (RLs) in the HeI singlet system is expected to be relatively simple, supported by accurate atomic models. We examine the intensities of HeI singlets $\lambda \lambda$3614, 3965, 5016, 6678, 7281 and the triplet HeI $\lambda$5876 in various types of ionized nebulae and compare them with theoretical predictions to test the validity of the ``Case B'' recombination scenario and the assumption of thermal homogeneity. Our analysis includes 85 spectra from Galactic and extragalactic HII regions, 90 from star-forming galaxies, and 218 planetary nebulae, all compiled by the DEep Spectra of Ionized REgions Database Extended (DESIRED-E) project. By evaluating the ratios HeI $\lambda$7281/$\lambda$6678 and HeI $\lambda$7281/$\lambda$5876, we determine $T_e$(HeI) and compare it with direct measurements of $T_e$([OIII] $\lambda$4363/$\lambda$5007). We find that $T_e$(HeI) is systematically lower than $T_e$([OIII]) across most objects and nebula types. Additionally, we identify a correlation between the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF(O$^{2+}$)) and the difference $T_e$([OIII]) - $T_e$(HeI) for planetary nebulae. We explore two potential explanations: photon loss from $n^1P \rightarrow 1^1S$ transitions and temperature inhomogeneities. Deviations from ``Case B'' may indicate photon absorption by HI rather than HeI and/or generalized ionizing photon escape, highlighting the need for detailed consideration of radiative transfer effects. If temperature inhomogeneities are widespread, identifying a common physical phenomenon affecting all ionized nebulae is crucial. Our results suggest that both scenarios can contribute to the observed discrepancies.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA three-millimeter observations of massive star-forming regions -- XVIII. On the origin and evolution of dense gas fragments in molecular shells of compact HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation and evolution for the molecular shells of the compact HII regions are less explored compared to their evolved counterparts. We map nine compact HII regions with a typical diameter of 0.4 pc that are surrounded by molecular shells traced by CCH. Several to a dozen dense gas fragments probed by H13CO+ are embedded in these molecular shells. These gas fragments, strongly affected by the HII region, have a higher surface density, mass, and turbulence than those outside the shells but within the same pc-scale natal clump. These features suggest that the shells swept up by the early HII regions can enhance the formation of massive dense structures that may host the birth of higher-mass stars. We examine the formation of fragments and find that fragmentation of the swept-up shell is unlikely to occur in these early HII regions, by comparing the expected time scale of shell fragmentation with the age of HII region. We propose that the appearance of gas fragments in these shells is probably the result of sweeping up pre-existing fragments into the molecular shell that has not yet fragmented. Taken together, this work provides a basis for understanding the interplay of star-forming sites with an intricate environment containing ionization feedback such as those observed in starburst regions.</description>

      <title>Early formation of supermassive black holes from the collapse of strongly self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for high-redshift supermassive black holes challenges standard scenarios for how such objects form in the early universe. Here, we entertain the possibility that a fraction of the cosmological dark matter could be ultra-strongly self interacting. This would imply that gravothermal collapse occur at early times in the cores of dark matter halos, followed by accretion. We study under which conditions on the abundance and interaction strength and structure of such ultra self-interacting dark matter the black holes resulting from the end-point of gravothermal core collapse can seed the observed, early-forming supermassive black holes. We find, depending on the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section, a bimodal structure in the favored parameter space, where data points to either a small collapsing dark matter fraction with a large cross section, or a large fraction and a relatively small cross section. While self-interaction cross sections with different velocity dependence can explain observations, we find that the best, self-consistent results correspond to a Rutherford-like self-interaction, typical of long-range dark-sector forces with light mediators. We discuss complementary observational probes if this scenario is realized in nature, focusing especially on the expected intermediate mass black holes predicted to exist in smaller galaxies.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Insights into the Lyman-alpha line widths and the size of ionized bubbles at the edge of cosmic reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic properties of 22 Lyman-alpha emitters(LAEs) at z=5.5-6.6 with Lyman-alpha(Lya) luminosity log($L_{Lya}$[$ergs^{-1}$])=42.4-43.5, obtained using VLT/MUSE as part of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy(MAGPI) survey.Additionally, we incorporate broad-band photometric data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam(HSC) for 17 LAEs in our sample.The HSC-y band magnitudes show that our LAEs are UV-bright, with rest-frame absolute UV magnitudes -19.7 &lt; $M_{UV}$ &lt; -23.3.We find that the Lya line width increases with luminosity, and this trend becomes more prominent at z &gt; 6 where Lya lines become significantly broadened (&gt; 260 $kms^{-1}$) at luminosities log($L_{Lya}$[$ergs^{-1}$]) &gt; 43.This broadening is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that these sources are located inside larger ionized bubbles.We observe a slightly elevated ionizing photon production efficiency estimated for LAEs at z &gt; 6, which indicates that younger galaxies could be producing more ionizing photons per UV luminosity.A tentative anti-correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency and Lya rest-frame equivalent width is noticed, which could indicate a time delay between production and escape of ionizing photon primarily due to supernovae activity.Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between bubble radius and Lya line width, which again suggests that large ionized bubbles are created around these LAEs, allowing them to self-shield from the scattering effects of the intergalactic medium (IGM).We also detect two closely separated LAEs at z=6.046 (projected spatial separation is 15.92 kpc).The size of their respective bubbles suggests that they likely sit inside a common large ionized region.Such a closely-separated LAE pair increases the size of ionized bubble, potentially allowing a boosted transmission of Lya through neutral IGM.</description>

      <title>ProGeny I: a new simple stellar population generator and impact of isochrones / stellar atmospheres / initial mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available forimmediate use.The mostnovelfeature ofProGeny is itsabilitytoproduce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions, allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertaintiesand corrections forstarformationrates andstellar massesare alsopresented.</description>

      <title>ProGeny II: the impact of libraries and model configurations on inferred galaxy properties in SED fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a volume-complete sample of $\sim$8,000 galaxies from the GAMA survey to characterise the impact of stellar population libraries (SPLs) and model configurations on the resulting inferred galaxy properties from Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. We compare a fiducial SPL from \textsc{ProGeny} (a new tool that can generate SPLs quickly and flexibly) against five other commonly used SPLs using the SED-fitting code \textsc{ProSpect}. The impact of selecting each SPL is compared to the consequence of changing the model implementation in the SED fitting process, including the implementation of metallicity evolution versus a fixed or constant metallicity, and a functional parametric star formation history (SFH) versus a stepwise parametric (or ``non-parametric") SFH. Furthermore, we use \textsc{ProGeny} to assess the impact of sub-SPL choices, including isochrone selection, atmosphere selection, and IMF selection. Through a comparison of derived stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities, ages, and the inferred cosmic star formation history (CSFH), we rank the impact of varying choices. Overall the assumption of a solar metallicity creates the greatest biases, with a substantial impact also caused by the choice of a specific SPL. To recover a CSFH most consistent with observations, we advocate for the use of the fiducial implementation with a skewed Normal functional form for the SFH, and an evolving metallicity. While all current SPLs currently underestimate the peak in the CSFH, \textsc{ProGeny} and FSPS are the closest to recovering the observed CSFH.</description>

      <title>The Radio-Infrared Nebula in II Zw 40: Clusters Forming in Colliding Elongated Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: II Zw 40 is a starburst dwarf and merger product, and holds a radio-infrared supernebula excited by thousands of embedded OB stars. We present here observations of three aspects of the supernebula: maps of the K and KU radio continuum that trace dense ionized gas with spatial resolution $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$, a spectral data cube of the [S IV]$10.5\mu$m emission line that measures the kinematics of the ionized gas with velocity resolution $4.5$ km s$^{-1}$, and an ALMA spectral cube of the CO(3-2) line that probes the dense warm molecular gas with spatial and velocity resolution comparable to the ionized gas. The observations suggest that the supernebula is the overlap,collision or merger of two star clusters, each associated with an elongated molecular cloud. We accordingly modelled the supernebula with simulations of colliding clusters. The model that best agrees with the data is a grazing collision that has distorted the gas and stars to create the distinctive structures observed. These models may have wide applicability in the cluster-rich regions of young starbursts.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency, multi-epoch radio continuum study of the Arches cluster with the VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arches cluster, one of the most massive clusters in the Milky Way, is located about 30 pc in projection from the central massive black hole. With its high mass, young age, and location in the Galaxy's most extreme star forming environment, the Arches is an extraordinary laboratory to study massive stars and clusters. Our objective is to improve our knowledge of the properties of massive stars and the Arches cluster through high angular resolution radio continuum studies. We observed the Arches cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in the C- and X-bands throughout 2016, 2018, and 2022. We used the A-configuration to achieve the highest possible angular resolution and cross-matched the detected point sources with stars detected in the infrared, using proper motion catalogues to ensure cluster membership. We report the most extensive radio point source catalogue of the cluster to date, with a total of 25 radio detections. We also created the deepest radio images of the cluster so far. Most of our stellar radio sources (12/18) show a positive spectral index, indicating that the dominant emission process is free-free thermal radiation, which probably originates from stellar winds. We found that radio variability is more frequent than what was inferred from previous observations, affecting up to 60% of the sources associated with bright stellar counterparts. We propose four of our detections (F6, F18, F19 and F26) as primary candidates for colliding-wind binaries based on their consistent flat-to-negative spectral index. We classify F7, F9, F12, F14, and F55 as secondary colliding wind binary candidates based on their high flux and/or spectral index variability, and X-ray counterparts. Thus, we infer a 61% multiplicity fraction for the Arches cluster radio-stars when combining our findings with recent infrared radial velocity studies.</description>

      <title>The Most Massive Early-type Galaxies Exhibit Tidal Features More Frequently in Lower-density Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are known to form through numerous galaxy mergers. Thus, it is intriguing to study whether their formation in low-density environments, where nearby companions are almost absent, is associated with mergers, which are directly traced by tidal features. Using the 436 most massive ETGs with $M_\mathrm{star}&gt;10^{11.2}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z&lt;0.04$, we determine the variation in the fraction of massive ETGs with tidal features ($f_T$) across different environments and verify whether the most massive ETGs commonly have tidal features in very low density environments. Our main discovery is that the most massive ETGs exhibit tidal features more frequently in lower-density environments. In the highest-density environments, like galaxy clusters, $f_T$ is $0.21\pm0.06$, while in the lowest-density environments it triples to $0.62\pm0.06$. This trend is stronger for more extremely massive ETGs, with $f_T$ reaching $0.92\pm0.08$ in the lowest-density environments. One explanation for our finding is that the most massive ETGs in lower-density environments have genuinely experienced recent mergers more frequently than their counterparts in higher-density environments, suggesting that they possess extended formation histories that continue into the present. Another possibility is that tidal features last shorter in denser environments owing to external factors inherent in these environments. Our additional findings that massive ETGs with bluer $u-r$ colors are a more dominant driver of our main discovery and that dust lanes are more commonly observed in massive ETGs in low-density environments imply that gas-abundant mergers primarily contribute to the increased rate of recent mergers in low-density environments.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with \texttt{POMPOCO}: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>CO-CAVITY project: Molecular gas and star formation in void galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids, distinguished by their low-density environment, provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between the cosmic environment and the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. Data on the molecular gas has been scarce so far. In this paper, we continue previous research done in the CO-CAVITY pilot project to study the molecular gas content and properties in void galaxies to search for possible differences compared to galaxies that inhabit denser structures. We observed at the IRAM 30 m telescope the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission of 106 void galaxies selected from the CAVITY survey. Together with data from the literature, we obtained a sample of 200 void galaxies with CO data. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_*$), the molecular gas fraction (MH$_2$/M$_*$), and the star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR/MH$_2$) between the void galaxies and a comparison sample of galaxies in filaments and walls, selected from the xCOLD GASS survey. We found no statistically significant difference between void galaxies and the comparison sample in the molecular gas fraction as a function of stellar mass for galaxies on the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). However, for void galaxies, the SFE was found to be constant across all stellar mass bins, while there is a decreasing trend with M$_*$ for the comparison sample. Finally, we found some indications for a smaller dynamical range in the molecular gas fraction as a function of distance to the SFMS in void galaxies. Overall, our analysis finds that the molecular gas properties of void galaxies are not very different from denser environments. The physical origin of the most significant difference that we found - a constant SFE as a function of stellar mass in void galaxies - is unclear and requires further investigation and higher-resolution data.</description>

      <title>The physical properties of Cluster Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the kinematics and star formation history of the Scorpius Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association following the initial identification of sequential, linearly aligned chains of clusters. Building upon our characterization of the Corona Australis (CrA) chain, we now analyze two additional major cluster chains that exhibit similar characteristics: the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Scorpius (Upper Sco) chains. All three cluster chains display distinct sequential patterns in 1) the 3D spatial distribution, 2) age, 3) velocity, and 4) mass. The Upper-Sco chain is the most massive and complex cluster chain, possibly consisting of two or more overlapping subchains. We discuss the possible formation of cluster chains and argue for a scenario where feedback from the most massive star formation episode 15 Myr ago initiated the formation of these spatio-temporal cluster sequences. Our results identify cluster chains as a distinct type of stellar structure with well-defined physical properties, formed in environments capable of sustaining stellar feedback over timescales of 5-10 Myr. We find that around 40% of the stellar population in Sco-Cen formed due to triggered star formation, with 35% forming along the three cluster chains. We conclude that cluster chains could be common structures in OB associations, particularly in regions that have similar natal environments as Sco-Cen. Beyond their significance for star formation and stellar feedback, they appear to be promising laboratories for chemical enrichment and the transport of elements from one generation to the next in the same star-forming region.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $53$ to $30$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also identify and measure a novel GW-gas coupling term in the in-spiral rate that makes gas effects an order of magnitude stronger than the gas-only contribution. We show that the evolution rate ($\dot a$) of the MBHB can be neatly expressed as the sum of the GW rate ($\dot a_{\rm GW}$), the pure gas-driven rate ($\dot a_{\rm gas}$), and their cross-term $\propto\dot a_{\rm GW}\dot a_{\rm gas}$. The source-frame gas-induced dephasing in the GW waveform is equivalent to losing $\sim0.5$ GW cycles over the expected $\sim1700$ cycles in a vacuum, which LISA should detect at redshift $z=1$. We also propose a phenomenological model that captures the essence of simulations and can be used to perform Bayesian inference. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications on multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We study the importance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms can result in $\sim 35\%$ error in the predicted source's horizon redshift. By developing relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms, we demonstrate significant improvements in detecting environmental effects. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameters (error $\sim6\%$), representing a significant improvement from previous estimates. We also estimated the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk causes bias in parameter estimation (PE) and report a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. Additionally, in a fully relativistic setup, we estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with high accuracy, achieving errors below $5\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass and below $0.5\%$ for the ultralight field's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects greatly enhances the accuracy and reliability of waveform predictions, essential for PE and model selection.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>Blast: a Web Application for Characterizing the Host Galaxies of Astrophysical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the host galaxies of astrophysical transients is important to many areas of astrophysics, including constraining the progenitor systems of core-collapse supernovae, correcting Type Ia supernova distances, and probabilistically classifying transients without photometric or spectroscopic data. Given the increasing transient discovery rate in the coming years, there is substantial utility in providing public, transparent, reproducible, and automatic characterization for large samples of transient host galaxies. Here we present Blast, a web application that ingests live streams of transient alerts, matches transients to their host galaxies, and performs photometry on coincident archival imaging data of the host galaxy. The photometry is then used to infer both global host-galaxy properties and galaxy properties within 2 kpc of the transient location by using the Prospector Bayesian inference framework, with an acceleration in evaluation speed achieved via simulation-based inference. Blast provides host-galaxy properties to users via a web browser or an application program interface. The software can be extended to support alternative photometric or SED-fitting algorithms, and can be scaled via an asynchronous worker queue across multiple compute nodes to handle the processing of large volumes of transient alerts for upcoming transient surveys. Blast has been ingesting newly discovered transients from the Transient Name Server since mid-2024, and has currently measured SED parameters for more than 6000 transients. The service is publicly available at https://blast.scimma.org/.</description>

      <title>A dynamics-based density profile for dark haloes -- III. Parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous paper of this series, we proposed a new function to fit halo density profiles out to large radii. This truncated Einasto profile models the inner, orbiting matter as $\rho_{\rm orb} \propto \exp \left[-2/\alpha\ (r / r_{\rm s})^\alpha - 1/\beta\ (r / r_{\rm t})^\beta \right]$ and the outer, infalling term as a power-law overdensity. In this paper, we analyse the resulting parameter space of scale radius $r_{\rm s}$, truncation radius $r_{\rm t}$, steepening $\alpha$, truncation sharpness $\beta$, infalling normalisation $\delta_1$, and infalling slope $s$. We show that these parameters are non-degenerate in averaged profiles, and that fits to the total profiles generally recover the underlying properties of the orbiting and infalling terms. We study the connection between profile parameters and halo properties such as mass (or peak height) and accretion rate. We find that the commonly cited dependence of $\alpha$ on peak height is an artefact of fitting Einasto profiles to the actual, truncated profiles. In our fits, $\alpha$ is independent of mass but dependent on accretion rate. When fitting individual halo profiles, the parameters exhibit significant scatter but otherwise follow the same trends. We confirm that the entire profiles are sensitive to the accretion history of haloes, and that the two radial scales $r_{\rm s}$ and $r_{\rm t}$ particularly respond to the formation time and recent accretion rate. As a result, $r_{\rm t}$ is a more accurate measure of the accretion rate than the commonly used radius where the density slope is steepest.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089: I. Multi-Wavelength Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars in $\gamma$-rays, exhibiting phases of very high activity. This study investigates its variability over a decade across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Utilizing the non-thermal dominance parameter, we analyze the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ continuum light curves to discern the primary source of continuum emission, either from the accretion disk or the jet, during different activity phases. Our findings underscore the dominance of jet emission in the continuum during flare-like events. We observed an approximately 80-day delay between the H$\beta$ and continuum emissions, which we attribute to the spatial separation between the optical emission zone and the broad-line region. Near-zero delays between optical and near-infrared emissions suggest that the emitting regions within the jet are co-spatial. Synchrotron self-Compton was identified as the primary mechanism for $\gamma$-ray emission during flares, supported by the minimal delay observed between optical/near-infrared emissions and $\gamma$-rays. Additionally, we found a delay of about 60 days between the leading optical/near-infrared emissions and X-rays, indicating that inverse Compton scattering within the jet predominantly drives X-ray emission. However, distinguishing between synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse Compton mechanism was not feasible. Shifts in the spectral index across the 15-230 GHz range corresponded with ejections from the radio core, suggesting changes in the physical conditions of the jet.</description>

Abstract: Mennekens and Vanbeveren (2014) studied the effect of double compact star mergers on the Galactic chemical enrichment of r-process elements. LIGO merger detections since 2015 and new r-process element yields as function of neutron star + neutron star and neutron star + black hole mass requires an update of the 2014 computations.

      <title>Exploring the halo-galaxy connection with probabilistic approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos encompasses a range of processes and play a pivotal role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, this link has been established through physical or empirical models. Machine learning techniques are adaptable tools that handle high-dimensional data and grasp associations between numerous attributes. In particular, probabilistic models capture the stochasticity inherent to these complex relations. We compare different probabilistic machine learning methods to model the uncertainty in the halo-galaxy connection and efficiently generate galaxy catalogs that faithfully resemble the reference sample by predicting joint distributions of central galaxy properties conditioned to their host halo features. The analysis is based on the IllustrisTNG300 simulation. The methods model the distributions in different ways. We compare a multilayer perceptron that predicts the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, a multilayer perceptron classifier, and the method of normalizing flows. The classifier predicts the parameters of a Categorical distribution, which are defined in a high-dimensional parameter space through a Voronoi cell-based hierarchical scheme. We evaluate the model's performances under various sample selections based on halo properties. The three methods exhibit comparable results, with normalizing flows showing the best performance in most scenarios. The models reproduce the main features of galaxy properties distributions with high-fidelity and reproduce the results obtained with traditional, deterministic, estimators. Our results also indicate that different halos and galaxy populations are subject to varying degrees of stochasticity, which has relevant implications for studies of large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Surviving the Waves: evidence for a Dark Matter cusp in the tidally disrupting Small Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use spectroscopic data for ${\sim}6,000$ Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), together with proper motion data from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), to build a mass model of the SMC. We test our Jeans mass modelling method (\textsc{Binulator}+\textsc{GravSphere}) on mock data for an SMC-like dwarf undergoing severe tidal disruption, showing that we are able to successfully remove tidally unbound interlopers, recovering the Dark Matter density and stellar velocity anisotropy profiles within our 95\% confidence intervals. We then apply our method to real SMC data, finding that the stars of the cleaned sample are isotropic at all radii (at 95\% confidence), and that the inner Dark Matter density profile is dense, $\rho_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm pc}) = 2.81_{-1.07}^{+0.72}\times 10^8 M_{\odot} \rm kpc^{-3} $, consistent with a $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cusp at least down to 400\,pc from the SMC's centre. Our model gives a new estimate of the SMC's total mass within 3\,kpc ($M_{\rm tot} \leq 3\,{\rm kpc})$ of $2.34\pm0.46 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. We also derive an astrophysical \textquote{$J$-factor} of $19.22\pm0.14$\, GeV$^2$\,cm$^{-5}$ and a \textquote{$D$-factor} of $18.80\pm0.03$\, GeV$^2$\,cm$^{-5}$, making the SMC a promising target for Dark Matter annihilation and decay searches. Finally, we combine our findings with literature measurements to test models in which Dark Matter is \textquote{heated up} by baryonic effects. We find good qualitative agreement with the Di Cintio et al. 2014 model but we deviate from the Lazar et al. 2020 model at high $M_*/M_{200} &gt; 10^{-2}$. We provide a new, analytic, density profile that reproduces Dark Matter heating behaviour over the range $10^{-5} &lt; M_*/M_{200} &lt; 10^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Comparing dark matter and MOND hyphotheses from the distribution function of A, F, early-G stars in the solar neighbourhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter is hypothetical matter believed to address the missing mass problem in galaxies. However, alternative theories, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), have been notably successful in explaining the missing mass problem in various astrophysical systems. The vertical distribution function of stars in the solar neighbourhood serves as a proxy to constrain galactic dynamics in accordance to its contents. We employ both the vertical positional and velocity distribution of stars in cylindrical coordinates with a radius of 150 pc and a half-height of 200 pc from the galactic plane. Our tracers consist of main-sequence A, F, and early-G stars from the GAIA, RAVE, APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST catalogues. We attempt to solve the missing mass in the solar neighbourhood, interpreting it as either dark matter or MOND. Subsequently, we compare both hypotheses newtonian gravity with dark matter and MOND, using the Bayes factor (BF) to determine which one is more favoured by the data. We found that the inferred dark matter in the solar neighbourhood is in range of $\sim (0.01$-$0.07)$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$. We also determine that the MOND hypothesis's acceleration parameter $a_0$ is $(1.26 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ for simple interpolating function. The average of bayes factor for all tracers between the two hypotheses is $\log \textrm{BF}\sim 0.1$, meaning no strong evidence in favour of either the dark matter or MOND hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Extreme emission line galaxies detected in JADES JWST/NIRSpec I: inferred galaxy properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) exhibit large equivalent widths (EW) in their rest-optical emission lines ([OIII]$\lambda5007$ or H$\alpha$ rest-frame EW$ &gt; 750\r{A}$) which can be tied to a recent upturn in star formation rate, due to the sensitivity of the nebular line emission and the rest-optical continuum to young ($&lt;10$Myr) and evolved stellar populations, respectively. By studying a sample of 85 star forming galaxies (SFGs), spanning the redshift and magnitude interval $3 &lt;z&lt;9.5$ and $-16&gt;$ M$_{UV}&gt;-21$, in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy, we determine that SFGs initiate an EELG phase when entering a significant burst of star formation, with the highest EWs observed in EELGs with the youngest luminosity-weighted ages ($&lt;5$ Myr old) and the highest burst intensity (those with the greatest excess between their current and long-term average SFR). We spectroscopically confirm that a greater proportion of SFGs are in an EELG phase at high redshift in our UV-selected sample ($61\pm4\%$ in our $z&gt;5.7$ high-redshift bin, compared to $23^{+4}_{-1}\%$ in our lowest-redshift bin $3&lt;z&lt;4.1$) due to the combined evolution of metallicity, ionisation parameter and star formation histories with redshift. We report that the EELGs within our sample exhibit a higher average ionisation efficiency ($\log_{10}(\xi_{ion}^{HII}/$erg$^{-1}$Hz)$=25.5\pm0.2$) than the non-EELGs. High-redshift EELGs therefore comprise a population of efficient ionising photon producers. Additionally, we report that $53\%$ (9/17) of EELGs at $z&gt;5.7$ have observed Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, potentially lying within large ionised regions. The high detection rate of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in our EELG selection suggests that the physical conditions associated with entering an EELG phase also promote the escape of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons.</description>

Abstract: We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at $z&gt;3$ Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey. These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts $3\lesssim z_{\rm phot}&lt;4$, photometric stellar masses log($M$/M$_\odot$)$&gt;11.7$, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UltraVISTA and VIDEO surveys. In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and post-starburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured $2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7$ galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at $z&gt;3$, one is a $z\sim1.2$ dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift. In fact, none of the sample has |$z_{\rm spec}-z_{\rm phot}$|$&lt;0.5$, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs. The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at $z\gtrsim3$ in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the `impossibly early galaxy problem' and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations. A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Predicting gravitational wave signals from BPASS White Dwarf Binary and Black Hole Binary populations of a Milky Way-like galaxy model for LISA</title>

Abstract: Galactic white dwarf binaries (WDBs) and black hole binaries (BHBs) will be gravitational wave (GW) sources for LISA. Their detection will provide insights into binary evolution and the evolution of our Galaxy through cosmic history. Here, we make predictions of the expected WDB and BHB population within our Galaxy. We combine predictions of the compact remnant binary populations expected by stellar evolution by using the detailed Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS) with a Milky Way analogue galaxy model from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations. We use \textsc{PhenomA} and \textsc{LEGWORK} to simulate LISA observations. Both packages make similar predictions that on average four Galactic BHBs and 673 Galactic WDBs above the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of 7 after a four-year mission. We compare these predictions to earlier results using the Binary Star Evolution (BSE) code with the same FIRE model galaxy. We find that BPASS predicts a few more LISA observable Galactic BHBs and a twentieth of the Galactic WDBs. The differences are due to the different physical assumptions that have gone into the binary evolution calculations. These results indicate that the expected population of compact binaries that LISA will detect depends very sensitively on the binary population synthesis models used and thus observations of the LISA population will provide tight constraints on our modelling of binary stars. Finally, from our synthetic populations we have created mock LISA signals that can be used to test and refine data processing methods of the eventual LISA observations.</description>

      <title>Nexus: A framework for conrolled simulations of idealised galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for realistic, dynamically self-consistent, evolving galaxy models that avoid the complexity of full, and zoom-in, cosmological simulations, we have developed NEXUS, an integral framework to create and evolve synthetic galaxies made of collisionless and gaseous components. NEXUS leverages the power of publicly available, tried-and-tested packages: the stellar-dynamics, action-based library AGAMA; and the adaptive mesh refinement, N-body/hydrodynamical code RAMSES, modified to meet our needs. In addition, we make use of a proprietary module to account for galaxy formation physics, including gas cooling and heating, star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment. NEXUS' basic functionality consists in the generation of bespoke initial conditions (ICs) for a diversity of galaxy models, which are advanced in time to simulate the galaxy's evolution. The fully self-consistent ICs are generated with a distribution-function based approach, as implemented in the galaxy modelling module of AGAMA -- up to now restricted to collisionless components, extended in this work to treat two types of gaseous configurations: hot halos and gas discs. NEXUS allows constructing equilibrium models with disc gas fractions $0~\leq~f_{\rm gas}~\leq~1$, appropriate to model both low- and high-redshift galaxies. Similarly, the framework is ideally suited to the study of galactic ecology, i.e. the dynamical interplay between stars and gas over billions of years. As a validation and illustration of our framework, we reproduce several isolated galaxy model setups reported in earlier studies, and present a new, `nested bar' galaxy simulation. Future upgrades of NEXUS will include magneto-hydrodynamics and highly energetic particle (`cosmic ray') heating.</description>

      <title>Strong Balmer break objects at z ~ 7-10 uncovered with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of robust spectroscopically confirmed Balmer break (BB) galaxies and candidates, with secure spectroscopic redshifts $7.1 \le z \le 9.6$ from publicly available JWST extra-galactic photometric and spectroscopic surveys. To do so, we used dedicated filters probing the Balmer break and inspected the objects with NIRSpec spectroscopy. We recover the previously known objects with strong Balmer breaks and reveal 10-11 new objects with clear BBs, thus tripling the number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with a BB at z &gt;7. Approximately half of them show a pure BB and no signs of recent star formation, whereas the other half shows BB and emission lines, indicating most likely galaxies whose star formation ceased earlier and has restarted recently. Overall we find that ~10-20% of all galaxies from our sample show signatures of an evolved stellar population. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the BB does not significantly depend on the rest-UV and rest-optical brightness of these sources. In short, our work confirms that photometry alone has the potential to measure BB strengths and to identify evolved stellar populations at high redshift and that such objects may be more frequent than previously thought. The presence of galaxies with a range of break strengths and the joint presence of BB and emission lines indicate a bursty nature of the star formation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Physical conditions in Centaurus A's northern filaments II: Does the HCO$^+$ emission highlight the presence of shocks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abridged: We present the first observation of the HCO+(1-0) and HCN(1-0) emission in the northern filaments of Centaurus A with ALMA. HCO+(1-0) is detected in 9 clumps of the Horseshoe complex, with similar velocities as the CO(1-0) emission. Conversely, the HCN(1-0) is not detected and we derive upper limits on the flux. At a resolution of ~40 pc, the line ratio of the velocity-integrated intensities I_HCO+/I_CO varies between 0.03 and 0.08, while I_HCO+/I_HCN is higher than unity with an average lower limit of 1.51. These ratios are significantly higher than what is observed in nearby star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the ratio I_HCO+/I_CO decreases with increasing CO integrated intensity, contrary to what is observed in the star-forming galaxies. This indicates that the HCO+ emission is enhanced and may not arise from dense gas within the Horseshoe complex. This hypothesis is strengthened by the average line ratio I_HCN/I_CO&lt;0.03 which suggests that the gas density is rather low. Using non-LTE, large velocity gradient modelling with RADEX, we explored two possible phases of the gas, that we call "diffuse" and "dense", and are characterised by a significant difference in the HCO+ relative abundance to CO, respectively N_HCO+/N_CO=10^-3 and 3x10^-5. The average CO(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) integrated intensities and the upper limit on HCN(1-0) are compatible with both "diffuse" and "dense" gas. The spectral setup of the present observations also covers the SiO(2-1). While undetected, the upper limit on SiO(2-1) is not compatible with the RADEX predictions for the "dense" gas. We conclude that the 9 molecular clouds detected in HCO+(1-0) are likely dominated by diffuse molecular gas. While the exact origin of the HCO+(1-0) emission remains to be investigated, it is likely related to the energy injection within the molecular gas that prevents gravitational collapse and star formation.</description>

      <title>Toward a robust physical and chemical characterization of heterogeneous lines of sight: The case of the Horsehead nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense cold molecular cores/filaments are surrounded by an envelope of translucent gas. Some of the low-J emission lines of CO and HCO$^+$ isotopologues are more sensitive to the conditions either in the translucent environment or in the dense cold one. We propose a cloud model composed of three homogeneous slabs of gas along each line of sight (LoS), representing an envelope and a shielded inner layer. IRAM-30m data from the ORION-B large program toward the Horsehead nebula are used to demonstrate the method's capability. We use the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX to model the line profiles from the kinetic temperature $T_{kin}$, the volume density $n_{H_2}$, kinematics and chemical properties of the different layers. We then use a maximum likelihood estimator to simultaneously fit the lines of the CO and HCO$^+$ isotopologues. We constrain column density ratios to limit the variance on the estimates. This simple heterogeneous model provides good fits of the fitted lines over a large part of the cloud. The decomposition of the intensity into three layers allows to discuss the distribution of the estimated physical/chemical properties along the LoS. About 80$\%$ the CO integrated intensity comes from the envelope, while $\sim55\%$ of that of the (1-0) and (2-1) lines of C$^{18}$O comes from the inner layer. The $N(^{13}CO)/N(C^{18}O)$ in the envelope increases with decreasing $A_v$, and reaches $25$ in the pillar outskirts. The envelope $T_{kin}$ varies from 25 to 40 K, that of the inner layer drops to $\sim 15$ K in the western dense core. The inner layer $n_{H_2}$ is $\sim 3\times10^4\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ toward the filament and it increases by a factor $10$ toward dense cores. The proposed method correctly retrieves the physical/chemical properties of the Horsehead nebula and offers promising prospects for less supervised model fits of wider-field datasets.</description>

      <title>The environment as a driver of galaxy evolution with the miniJPAS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis aims at discerning the effect of environment on galaxy evolution and on the properties of galaxies, using the data from the miniJPAS survey, a 1~deg$^2$ survey that uses the same photometric filter system as the incoming J-PAS survey, which is already in its scientific verification phase. This system is composed of 56 narrow-band filters that provide an spectral resolution comparable to low-resolution spectroscopy. We study the effect of environment using two approaches. First, we study the spatially resolved galaxies from miniJPAS. Secondly, we studied the galaxy population in the most massive galaxy cluster detected in the miniJPAS footprint, that is, the cluster mJPC2470-1771. We have developed a tool that automatises all the required processes for the analysis of the data. After probing the accuracy and reliability of the photmetry obtained with our tool, we apply it to a miniJPAS sample of spatially resolved galaxies, divided into four sub-samples according to their spectral-type (red/quiescent and blue/star forming), and environment (field or galaxy group). We find that redder, denser regions are usually older, more metal rich, and show lower values of the intensity of the star formation rate and the specific star formation rate than bluer and less dense regions. Regarding the mJPC2470-1771 cluster, our results point that more massive, redder and older galaxies typically populate the inner regions of the cluster. As a conclusion, our results suggest that galaxies in clusters are formed at a similar epoch, but have experienced different star formation histories. We conclude that the environment plays a role on galaxy evolution, but it is mainly reflected through the galaxy populations found in high density environments, such as galaxy clusters and groups, where the fraction of red, quiescent galaxies is larger in comparison to the field.</description>

      <title>Deep kiloparsec view of the molecular gas in a massive star-forming galaxy at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep ($\sim$ 20 hr), high-angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $\rm CO ~ (4-3)$ and $\rm [CI] ~ (1-0)$ transitions, along with the rest-frame 630 $\mu$m dust continuum, in BX610 --a massive, main-sequence galaxy at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation $(z = 2.21)$. Combined with deep Very Large Telescope (VLT) SINFONI observations of the H$\alpha$ line, we characterize the molecular gas and star formation activity on kiloparsec scales. Our analysis reveals that the excitation of the molecular gas, as traced by the $L'_{\rm CO ~ (4-3)} / L'_{\rm [CI] ~ (1-0)}$ line luminosity ratio, decreases with increasing galactocentric radius. While the line luminosity ratios in the outskirts are similar to those typically found in main-sequence galaxies at $z \sim 1$, the ratios in the central regions of BX610 are comparable to those observed in local starbursts. There is also a giant extra-nuclear star-forming clump in the southwest of BX610 that exhibits high star formation activity, molecular gas abundance, and molecular gas excitation. Furthermore, the central region of BX610 is rich in molecular gas $(M_{\rm mol} / M_{\rm \star} \approx 1)$; however, at the current level of star formation activity, such molecular gas is expected to be depleted in $\sim$ 450 Myr. This, along with recent evidence for rapid inflow toward the center, suggests that BX610 may be experiencing an evolutionary phase often referred to as wet compaction, which is expected to lead to central gas depletion and subsequent inside-out quenching of star formation activity.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid technique for generating sub-grid haloes in reionization simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the distribution of cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) during the epoch of reionization requires a high dynamic range and is hence computationally expensive. The size of the simulation is dictated by the largest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the smallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a hybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume, low-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume, high-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic range, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of the computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation. Our method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo field, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the two-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all within 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts. Our technique, combined with semi-numerical models of reionization, provides a resource-efficient tool for modeling the HI distribution at high redshifts.</description>
