      <title>Percolation, fractals and the critical point in a nuclear reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trajectories of neutrons in the reactor, the points of their fission of uranium nuclei, the points of neutron absorption, fission chains and chain reactions are considered from the standpoint of fractal geometry and percolation theory. In the study of the stationary critical operating mode of a nuclear reactor, models of Cayley trees and Laplacian fractals are used. This approach allows us to obtain the neutron multiplication equation and an expression for the critical size of the reactor. Models of irreversible growth and various fractal dimensions are also considered as applied to the evolution of neutrons in a reactor. Prospects for the development of the proposed approach to describing reactors, primarily the kinetics and processes of neutron transfer, are indicated.</description>

      <title>Syntropy in complex systems: A complement to Shannon's Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the syntropy function ($S_N$) and expectancy function ($E_N$), derived from the novel function $\phi$, to provide a refined perspective on complexity, extending beyond conventional entropy analysis. $S_N$ is designed to detect localized coherent events, whereas $E_N$ encapsulates expected system behaviors, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding system dynamics. The manuscript explores essential theorems and properties, underscoring their theoretical and practical implications. Future research will further elucidate their roles, particularly in biological signals and dynamic systems, suggesting a deep interplay between order and chaos.</description>

      <title>The trimer paradox: the effect of stiff constraints on equilibrium distributions in overdamped dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method of calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.</description>

      <title>On unitary time evolution out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional quantum systems which for positive times evolve with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates. We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how, in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies and reproduces that known perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of generalized TASEP on an open chain: Liggett-like boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with generalized update is a version of the discrete time totally asymmetric exclusion process with an additional inter-particle interaction that controls the degree of particle clustering. Though the model was shown to be integrable on the ring and on the infinite lattice, on the open chain it was studied mainly numerically, while no analytic results existed even for its phase diagram. In this paper we introduce new boundary conditions associated with the infinite translation invariant stationary states of the model, which allow us to obtain the exact phase diagram analytically. We discuss the phase diagram in detail and confirm the analytic predictions by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect driven by phonon-magnon hybridization in a honeycomb antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van de Waals stack of honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle ($\kappa_{ab}/\kappa_{aa}/B$) respects a previously identified bound. The amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path, which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The exponential temperature dependence of $\kappa_{ab}$ above its peak reveals an energy scale on the order of magnitude of the gap expected to be opened by magnon-phonon hybridization. This points to an intrinsic scenario for THE with possible relevance to other magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cats states by energy conservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superposition by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a direct Monte Carlo simulation of the diffusion in a multicomponent granular medium. We investigate the diffusion coefficients and mean-squared displacements of granular particles in a polydisperse granular gas in a homogeneous cooling state containing an arbitrary number of species of different sizes and masses using both models of constant and time-dependent restitution coefficients. In our study, we used a powerful low-rank algorithm that allows for efficient simulation of highly polydisperse granular systems. Mean square displacements in Monte Carlo simulations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Accurate heat currents via reorganised master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed pattern formation in systems of active particles with chiral forces in the context of pedestrian dynamics. To describe the interparticle interactions, we use the standard social force model and supplement it with a new type of force that reflects the chirality. We performed numerical simulations of two pedestrian flows moving in opposite directions in a long corridor. We observed two dynamic phase transitions which occur for varying number density of particles and strength of the chirality force -- one from disordered motion to multi-lane motion and another -- from the multi-lane to two-lane motion. We develop a qualitative theory which describes the demarcation lines for these phase transitions on the phase diagram chirality-density. The results of our analysis agree fairly well with the simulation data. Our findings may find applications for problems of urban and transportation planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply adiabatic theorems developed for quantum mechanics to stochastic annealing processes described by the classical master equation with a time-dependent generator. When the instantaneous stationary state is unique and the minimum decay rate g is nonzero, the time-evolved state is basically relaxed to the instantaneous stationary state. By formulating an asymptotic expansion rigorously, we derive conditions for the annealing time T that the state is close to the instantaneous stationary state. Depending on the time dependence of the generator, typical conditions are written as T&gt; const/g^a with 1&lt;a&lt;2. We also find that a rigorous treatment gives the scaling T&gt;const|ln g|/g^2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chiral coordinate Bethe ansatz method is developed to study the periodic XYZ chain. We construct a set of chiral vectors with fixed number of kinks. All vectors are factorized and have simple structures. Under roots of unity conditions, the Hilbert space has an invariant subspace and our vectors form a basis of this subspace. We propose a Bethe ansatz solely based on the action of the Hamiltonian on the chiral vectors, avoiding the use of transfer matrix techniques. This allows to parameterize the expansion coefficients and derive the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies and eigenstates. Our analytic results agree with earlier approaches, notably by Baxter, and are supported by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Universality of critical dynamics on a complex network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the spectral dimension $d_s$ in determining the universality of phase transitions on a complex network. Due to its structural heterogeneity, a complex network generally acts as a disordered system. Specifically, we study the synchronization and entrainment transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Kuramoto model and the phase transition of the equilibrium dynamics of the classical $XY$ model, thereby covering a broad spectrum from nonlinear dynamics to statistical and condensed matter physics. Using linear theory, we obtain a general relationship between the dynamics occurring on the network and the underlying network properties. This yields the lower critical spectral dimension of the phase synchronization and entrainment transitions in the Kuramoto model as $d_s=4$ and $d_s=2$ respectively, whereas for the phase transition in the $XY$ model it is $d_s=2$. To test our theoretical hypotheses, we employ a network where any two nodes on the network are connected with a probability proportional to a power law of the distance between the nodes; this realizes any desired $d_s\in [1, \infty)$. Our detailed numerical study agrees well with the prediction of linear theory for the phase synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model. However, it shows a clear entrainment transition in the Kuramoto model and phase transition in the $XY$ model at $d_s \gtrsim 3$, not $d_s=2$ as predicted by linear theory. Our study indicates that network disorder in the region $2 \leq d_s \lesssim 3$ introduces strong finite-size fluctuations, which makes it extremely difficult to probe the existence of the ordered phase as predicted, affecting the dynamics profoundly.</description>

      <title>Random Linear Systems with Quadratic Constraints: from Random Matrix Theory to replicas and back</title>

Abstract: I present here a pedagogical introduction to the works by Rashel Tublin and Yan V. Fyodorov on random linear systems with quadratic constraints, using tools from Random Matrix Theory and replicas. These notes illustrate and complement the material presented at the Summer School organised within the Puglia Summer Trimester 2023 in Bari (Italy). Consider a system of $M$ linear equations in $N$ unknowns, $\sum_{j=1}^N A_{kj}x_j=b_k$ for $k=1,\ldots,M$, subject to the constraint that the solutions live on the $N$-sphere, $x_1^2+\ldots + x_N^2=N$. Assume that both the coefficients $A_{ij}$ and the parameters $b_i$ be independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Using two different approaches -- based on Random Matrix Theory and on a replica calculation -- it is possible to compute whether a large linear system subject to a quadratic constraint is typically solvable or not, as a function of the ratio $\alpha=M/N$ and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the $b_i$'s. This is done by defining a quadratic loss function $H({\bf x})=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^M\left[\sum_{j=1}^NA_{kj} x_j-b_k\right]^2$ and computing the statistics of its minimal value on the sphere, $E_{min}=\min_{||\bf x||^2=N}H({\bf x})$, which is zero if the system is compatible, and larger than zero if it is incompatible. One finds that there exists a compatibility threshold $0&lt;\alpha_c&lt;1$, such that systems with $\alpha&gt;\alpha_c$ are typically incompatible. This means that even weakly under-complete linear systems could become typically incompatible if forced to additionally obey a quadratic constraint.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition between spin liquid and spin nematics in spin-1 Kitaev honeycomb model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides the exactly solvable spin-1/2 Kitaev model, higher spin-$S$ ones, not exactly solvable, are promising playgrounds for researches on the quantum spin liquid as well. One of the main interests in higher spin-S cases is the interplay between the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and spin nematics. We probe this interplay in a spin-1 model on the honeycomb lattice with competing bilinear-biquadratic and Kitaev interactions. Utilizing the 2D infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS), we map out the phase diagram for the ferro-biquadratic interaction. In the phase diagram, we discover the direct KSL--spin-nematics transitions in the vicinity of pure Kitaev limits. It has been revealed that the ferro KSL exhibits robustness against perturbations from ferro-quadrupolar interactions. Also, the spin-nematic phase is extended to the parameter region near the antiferro-Kitaev limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired identification of complex cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elementary cellular automata (ECA) present iconic examples of complex systems. Though described only by one-dimensional strings of binary cells evolving according to nearest-neighbour update rules, certain ECA rules manifest complex dynamics capable of universal computation. Yet, the classification of precisely which rules exhibit complex behaviour remains a significant challenge. Here we approach this question using tools from quantum stochastic modelling, where quantum statistical memory -- the memory required to model a stochastic process using a class of quantum machines -- can be used to quantify the structure of a stochastic process. By viewing ECA rules as transformations of stochastic patterns, we ask: Does an ECA generate structure as quantified by the quantum statistical memory, and if so, how quickly? We illustrate how the growth of this measure over time correctly distinguishes simple ECA from complex counterparts. Moreover, it provides a more refined means for quantitatively identifying complex ECAs -- providing a spectrum on which we can rank the complexity of ECA by the rate in which they generate structure.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of superintegrable quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02038v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superintegrable models are very special dynamical systems: they possess more conservation laws than what is necessary for complete integrability. This severely constrains their dynamical processes, and it often leads to their exact solvability, even in non-equilibrium situations. In this paper we consider special Hamiltonian deformations of superintegrable quantum circuits. The deformations break superintegrability, but they preserve integrability. We focus on a selection of concrete models and show that for each model there is an (at least) one parameter family of integrable deformations. Our most interesting example is the so-called Rule54 model. We show that the model is compatible with a one parameter family of Yang-Baxter integrable spin chains with six-site interaction. Therefore, the Rule54 model does not have a unique integrability structure, instead it lies at the intersection of a family of quantum integrable models.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Prethermalization in a Driven Quantum Spin Liquid</title>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <title>Theory of non-linear diffusion with a physical gapped mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a system with one conserved charge the charge diffusion is modified by non-linear self-interactions within an effective field theory (EFT) of diffusive fluctuations. We include the slowest ultraviolet (UV) mode, constructing a UV-regulated EFT. The relaxation time of this UV mode is protected from renormalization, as supported by experimental data in a bad metal system. Furthermore, the retarded density-density Green's function acquires four branch points, eventually increasing the range of applicability. We discuss the fate of long-time-tails as well as implications for the quark gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between the Fitness-Complexity and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover the connection between the Fitness-Complexity algorithm, developed in the economic complexity field, and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, widely used in diverse domains ranging from computer science and mathematics to economics. Despite minor formal differences between the two methods, both converge to the same fixed-point solution up to normalization. The discovered connection allows us to derive a rigorous interpretation of the Fitness and the Complexity metrics as the potentials of a suitable energy function. Under this interpretation, high-energy products are unfeasible for low-fitness countries, which explains why the algorithm is effective at displaying nested patterns in bipartite networks. We also show that the proposed interpretation reveals the scale invariance of the Fitness-Complexity algorithm, which has practical implications for the algorithm's implementation in different datasets. Further, analysis of empirical trade data under the new perspective reveals three categories of countries that might benefit from different development strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20261v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of the three basic states of matter (solids, liquids and gases) is based on temperature and pressure phase diagrams with three phase transition lines: solid-gas, liquid-gas and solid-liquid lines. There are analytical expressions $P(T)$ for the first two lines derived on a purely general-theoretical thermodynamic basis. In contrast, there exists no similar function for the third, melting, line (ML). Here, we develop a general two-phase theory of MLs and their analytical form. This theory predicts the parabolic form of the MLs for normal melting, relates the MLs to thermal and elastic properties of liquid and solid phases and quantitatively agrees with experimental MLs in different system types. We show that the parameters of the ML parabola are governed by fundamental physical constants. In this sense, parabolic MLs possess universality across different systems.</description>

      <title>Motility-induced coexistence of a hot liquid and a cold gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If two phases exist at the same time, such as a gas and a liquid, they have the same temperature. This fundamental law of equilibrium physics is known to apply even to many non-equilibrium systems. However, recently, there has been much attention in the finding that inertial self-propelled particles like Janus colloids in a plasma or microflyers could self-organize into a hot gas-like phase that coexists with a colder liquid-like phase. Here, we show that a kinetic temperature difference across coexisting phases can occur even in equilibrium systems when adding generic (overdamped) self-propelled particles. In particular, we consider mixtures of overdamped active and inertial passive Brownian particles and show that when they phase separate into a dense and a dilute phase, both phases have different kinetic temperatures. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase (liquid) cannot only be colder but also hotter than the dilute phase (gas). This effect hinges on correlated motions where active particles collectively push and heat up passive ones primarily within the dense phase. Our results answer the fundamental question if a non-equilibrium gas can be colder than a coexisting liquid and create a route to equip matter with self-organized domains of different kinetic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phase transitions in non-Hermitian Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between unitary evolution and projective measurements could induce entanglement phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-particle systems. In this work, we uncover loss-induced entanglement transitions in non-Hermitian topological superconductors. In prototypical Kitaev chains with local particle losses and varying hopping and pairing ranges, the bipartite entanglement entropy of steady states is found to scale logarithmically versus the system size in topologically nontrivial phases and become independent of the system size in the trivial phase. Notably, the scaling coefficients of log-law entangled phases are distinguishable when the underlying system resides in different topological phases. Log-law to log-law and log-law to area-law entanglement phase transitions are further identified when the system switches between different topological phases and goes from a topologically nontrivial to a trivial phase, respectively. These findings not only establish the relationships among spectral, topological and entanglement properties in a class of non-Hermitian topological superconductors, but also provide an efficient means to dynamically reveal their distinctive topological features.</description>
