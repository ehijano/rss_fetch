      <title>On Galois covers of curves and arithmetic of Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the arithmetic of curves and Jacobians endowed with the action of a finite group $G$. This includes a study of the basic properties, as $G$-modules, of their $\ell$-adic representations, Selmer groups, rational points and Shafarevich-Tate groups. In particular, we show that $p^\infty$-Selmer groups are self-dual $G$-modules, and give various `$G$-descent' results for Selmer groups and rational points. Along the way we revisit, and slightly refine, a construction going back to Kani and Rosen for associating isogenies to homomorphisms between permutation representations.
  With a view to future applications, it is convenient to work throughout with curves that are not assumed to be geometrically connected (or even connected); such curves arise naturally when taking Galois closures of covers of curves. For lack of a suitable reference, we carefully detail how to deduce the relevant properties of such curves and their Jacobians from the more standard geometrically connected case.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetric power $L$-functions and their Fourier coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H_k$ be the set of all normalized primitive holomorphic cusp forms of even integral weight $k\geq 2$ for the full modular group $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$, and let $j\geq 3$ be any fixed integer. For $f\in H_k$, we write $\lambda_{{\rm{sym}^j }f}(n)$ for the $n^\textit{th}$ normalized Fourier coefficient of $L(s,{\rm{sym}}^j f)$. In this article, we establish an asymptotic formula for the sum $$\begin{equation} \sum_{\substack{n=a_1^2+a_2^2+\ldots+a_6^2\leq x\\ \left(a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_6\right)\in \mathbb{Z}^6}} \lambda_{{\rm{sym}}^j f}^2(n), \end{equation}$$ with an improved error term.</description>

      <title>A note on the parity conjecture and base change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity conjecture predicts that the parity of the rank of an abelian variety is determined by its global root number, that is by the sign in the conjectural functional equation of its L-function. Assuming the Shafarevich-Tate conjecture, we show that if a semistable principally polarised abelian variety $A/\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies the parity conjecture over $\mathbb{Q}$ and over all quadratic fields, then it satisfies it over all number fields. More generally, we establish a criterion for when the parity conjecture for the base change of an abelian variety to a larger number field is already implied by the parity conjecture over the ground field and over other small extensions.</description>

      <title>Toward resolving Kang and Park's generalization of the Alder-Andrews Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alder-Andrews Theorem, a partition inequality generalizing Euler's partition identity, the first Rogers-Ramanujan identity, and a theorem of Schur to $d$-distinct partitions of $n$, was proved successively by Andrews in 1971, Yee in 2008, and Alfes, Jameson, and Lemke Oliver in 2010. While Andrews and Yee utilized $q$-series and combinatorial methods, Alfes et al. proved the finite number of remaining cases using asymptotics originating with Meinardus together with high-performance computing. In 2020, Kang and Park conjectured a "level $2$" Alder-Andrews type partition inequality which relates to the second Rogers-Ramanujan identity. Duncan, Khunger, the second author, and Tamura proved Kang and Park's conjecture for all but finitely many cases using a combinatorial shift identity. Here, we generalize the methods of Alfes et al. to resolve nearly all of the remaining cases of Kang and Park's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Low-weight codewords in cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formula for determining the number of codewords of weight 2 in cyclic codes and provide results related to the count of codewords with weight 3. Additionally, we establish a recursive relationship for binary cyclic codes that connects their weight distribution to the number of solutions of associated systems of polynomial equations. This relationship allows for the computation of weight distributions from known solutions of systems of diagonal equations and vice versa, offering a new insight into the structure and properties of binary cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Theta characteristics and noncongruence modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hodge bundle $\omega$ over a modular curve is a square-root of the canonical bundle twisted by the cuspidal divisor, or a theta characteristic, due to the Kodaira--Spencer isomorphism. We prove that, in most cases, a section of a theta characteristic $\nu$ (or any odd power of it) different from $\omega$ is a noncongruence modular form. On the other hand, we show how $\nu\ne\omega$ gives rise to a ``twisted'' analogue of the diagonal period map to a Siegel threefold, whose difference attributes to the stackiness of the moduli of abelian surfaces $\mathcal{A}_{2}$. Some questions on the Brill--Noether theory of the modular curves are answered.</description>

      <title>A new family of binary sequences with a low correlation via elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of modern digital communication, cryptography, and signal processing, binary sequences with a low correlation properties play a pivotal role. In the literature, considerable efforts have been dedicated to constructing good binary sequences of various lengths. As a consequence, numerous constructions of good binary sequences have been put forward. However, the majority of known constructions leverage the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $p$ is a prime and $n$ is a positive integer. Recently, the authors made use of the cyclic group structure of all rational places of the rational function field over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, and firstly constructed good binary sequences of length $p^n+1$ via cyclotomic function fields over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for any prime $p$ \cite{HJMX24,JMX22}. This approach has paved a new way for constructing good binary sequences. Motivated by the above constructions, we exploit the cyclic group structure on rational points of elliptic curves to design a family of binary sequences of length $2^n+1+t$ with a low correlation for many given integers $|t|\le 2^{(n+2)/2}$. Specifically, for any positive integer $d$ with $\gcd(d,2^n+1+t)=1$, we introduce a novel family of binary sequences of length $2^n+1+t$, size $q^{d-1}-1$, correlation bounded by $(2d+1) \cdot 2^{(n+2)/2}+ |t|$, and a large linear complexity via elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>A Fourier-Jacobi Dirichlet series for cusp forms on orthogonal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Dirichlet series involving the Fourier$-$Jacobi coefficients of two cusp forms $F,G$ for orthogonal groups of signature $(2,n+2)$. In the case when $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ is a Maass lift of a specific Poincar\'e series, we establish a connection with the standard $L-$function attached to $F$. What is more, we find explicit choices of orthogonal groups, for which we obtain a clear$-$cut Euler product expression for this Dirichlet series. Our considerations recover a classical result for Siegel modular forms, first introduced by Kohnen and Skoruppa, but also provide a range of new examples, which can be related to other kinds of modular forms, such as paramodular, hermitian and quaternionic.</description>

      <title>Tauberian theory and the Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18859v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, I present a Tauberian equivalence of the Riemann hypothesis within the framework of the theory of regular arithmetic functions, a branch of Tauberian theory that extends the theory of functions with good variation introduced in 2016.
  The central element of this study is the function $\Phi(x)=x\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor$, which allows for the extension of Ingham's summation method [Ingham] far beyond the prime number theorem by linking it to the Riemann hypothesis. I thus demonstrate the following equivalence $$RH\Longleftrightarrow\alpha\left(\Phi\right)=\frac{1}{2}$$ where $\alpha\left(\Phi\right)$ represents the index of good variation of $\Phi$, an essential characteristic of functions of good variation. This equivalence of the Riemann hypothesis is a potential new contribution absent from recent comprehensive catalogs of equivalent of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematical literature.</description>

      <title>Integral Regulators on Mirror Curves with Mass Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18356v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Codesido-Grassi-Marino laid the foundation of a connection between local CY 3-folds and the spectra of operators attached to their mirror curves in the context of Topological String Theory. In a 2024 paper with C. Doran and M. Kerr, the author previously deduced two consequences of this conjecture; one relating zeroes of higher normal function to the spectra of operators of genus one curves, the other connecting integral regulators of $K_2$-classes on mirror curves to dilogarithm values at algebraic arguments. We now show that the latter continues to hold in the presence of a mass parameter, thus expanding the range of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Overlapping substitutions and tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by \cite{DBZ},we generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. For such a substitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping substitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We compute the resultant measures for iterations $P^j$, $j\ge 1$, of a polynomial $P$ of degree $&gt;1$ on the $n$-th level Trucco's trees $\Gamma_n$, $n\ge 0$, in the Berkovich projective line over a non-archimedean field and also determine their barycenters. As applications, we study the asymptotic of those barycenters as $n\to\infty$, and establish a uniform stationarity of Rumely's minimal resultant loci of $P^j$ or equivalently that of the potential semistable reduction loci of $P^j$ as $j\to\infty$. We also establish several equidistribution results for the resultant measures themselves as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>New explicit bounds for Mertens function and the reciprocal of the Riemann zeta-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish new explicit bounds for the Mertens function $M(x)$. In particular, we compare $M(x)$ against a short-sum over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$, whose difference we can bound using recent computations and explicit bounds for the reciprocal of $\zeta(s)$. Using this relationship, we are able to prove explicit versions of $M(x) \ll x\exp\left(-\eta_1 \sqrt{\log{x}}\right)$ and $M(x) \ll x\exp\left(-\eta_2 (\log{x})^{3/5} (\log\log{x})^{-1/5}\right)$ for some $\eta_i &gt; 0$. Our bounds with the latter form are the first explicit results of their kind. In the process of proving these, we establish another novel result, namely explicit bounds of the form $1/\zeta(\sigma + it) \ll (\log{t})^{2/3} (\log\log{t})^{1/4}$.</description>

      <title>Powers of the Cartier operator on Artin-Schreier covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curves in positive characteristic have a Cartier operator acting on their space of regular differentials. The $a$-number of a curve is defined to be the dimension of the kernel of the Cartier operator. In \cite{BoCaASc}, Booher and Cais used a sheaf-theoretic approach to give bounds on the $a$-numbers of Artin-Schreier covers. In this paper, that approach is generalized to arbitrary powers of the Cartier operator, yielding bounds for the dimension of the kernel. These bounds give new restrictions on the Ekedahl-Oort type of Artin-Schreier covers.</description>

Abstract: The periodic points of the algebraic function defined by the equation $g(x,y) = x^3(4y^2+2y+1)-y(y^2-y+1)$ are shown to be expressible in terms of Ramanujan's cubic continued fraction $c(\tau)$ with arguments in an imaginary quadratic field in which the prime $3$ splits. If $w = (a+\sqrt{-d})/2$ lies in an order of conductor $f$ in $K$ and $9 \mid N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(w)$, then one of these periodic points is $c(w/3)$, which is shown to generate the ring class field of conductor $2f$ over $K$.</description>

      <title>Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields III: a spherical Gowers inverse theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the third part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we prove an inverse theorem over finite field for spherical Gowers norms, i.e. a local Gowers norm supported on a sphere. We show that if the $(s+1)$-th spherical Gowers norm of a 1-bounded function $f\colon\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}\to \mathbb{C}$ is at least $\epsilon$ and if $d$ is sufficiently large depending only on $s$, then $f$ correlates on the sphere with a $p$-periodic $s$-step nilsequence, where the bounds for the complexity and correlation depend only on $d$ and $\epsilon$. This result will be used in later parts of the series to prove the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the fourth and the last part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the Geometric Ramsey Conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we proof a conjecture of Graham on the Remsey properties for spherical configurations in the finite field setting. To be more precise, we show that for any spherical configuration $X$ of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ of complexity at most $C$ with $d$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$ and $\vert X\vert$, and for some prime $p$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$, $\vert X\vert$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, any set $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ with $\vert E\vert&gt;\epsilon p^{d}$ contains at least $\gg_{C,\epsilon,\vert X\vert}p^{(k+1)d-(k+1)k/2}$ congruent copies of $X$, where $k$ is the dimension of $\text{span}_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}(X-X)$. The novelty of our approach is that we avoid the use of harmonic analysis, and replace it by the theory of spherical higher order Fourier analysis developed in previous parts of the series.</description>

      <title>Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields I: equidistribution for nilsequences</title>

Abstract: This paper is the first part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we prove a quantitative equidistribution theorem for polynomial sequences in a nilmanifold, where the average is taken along spheres instead of cubes. To be more precise, let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{d}$ be the preimage of a sphere $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ under the natural embedding from $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. We showed that if a rational polynomial sequence $(g(n)\Gamma)_{n\in\Omega}$ is not equidistributed on a nilmanifold $G/\Gamma$, then there exists a nontrivial horizontal character $\eta$ of $G/\Gamma$ such that $\eta\circ g \mod \mathbb{Z}$ vanishes on $\Omega$.
  We also prove quantitative equidistribution and factorization theorems for more general sets arising from quadratic forms defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. These results will serve as fundamental tools in later parts of the series to proof the spherical Gowers inverse theorem and the geometric Ramsey conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Let $d$ be any positive and non square integer. We prove an upper bound for the first two moments of the length $T(d)$ of the period of the continued fraction expansion for $\sqrt{d}$. This allows to improve the existing results for the large deviations of $T(d)$.</description>

      <title>Solutions of full equations related to diagonal equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $m$ be an even positive integer, and $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field with $q = p^m$ elements. In this paper, we compute the number of solutions with all coordinates in $\mathbb{F}_q^*$ of equations of the form $$a_1 x_1^{d} + \dots + a_s x_s^{d} = b, \quad a_i \in \mathbb{F}_q^*, \, b \in \mathbb{F}_q,$$ when the coefficients and exponents satisfy arithmetic conditions that allow the computation through pure Gauss sums. We then apply this result to compute the number of solutions of equations of the form \begin{equation*}
  a_1 x_1^{d_{1,1}} \cdots x_n^{d_{n,1}} + \dots + a_s x_1^{d_{1,s}}\cdots x_n^{d_{n,s}} = b, \end{equation*} where all exponents are positive, and the equation is related in a certain way to a diagonal equation with the characteristics we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>On a problem of Nathanson on non-minimal additive complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ and $W$ be two sets of integers. If $C+W=\mathbb{Z}$, then $C$ is called an additive complement to $W$. We further call $C$ a minimal additive complement to $W$ if no proper subset of $C$ is an additive complement to $W$. Answering a problem of Nathanson in part, we give sufficient conditions of $W$ which has no minimal additive complements. Our result also extends the prior result of Chen and Yang.</description>
