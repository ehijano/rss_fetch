      <title>Music to Dance as Language Translation using Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesising appropriate choreographies from music remains an open problem. We introduce MDLT, a novel approach that frames the choreography generation problem as a translation task. Our method leverages an existing data set to learn to translate sequences of audio into corresponding dance poses. We present two variants of MDLT: one utilising the Transformer architecture and the other employing the Mamba architecture. We train our method on AIST++ and PhantomDance data sets to teach a robotic arm to dance, but our method can be applied to a full humanoid robot. Evaluation metrics, including Average Joint Error and Frechet Inception Distance, consistently demonstrate that, when given a piece of music, MDLT excels at producing realistic and high-quality choreography. The code can be found at github.com/meowatthemoon/MDLT.</description>

      <title>Target Speech Extraction with Pre-trained AV-HuBERT and Mask-And-Recover Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual target speech extraction (AV-TSE) is one of the enabling technologies in robotics and many audio-visual applications. One of the challenges of AV-TSE is how to effectively utilize audio-visual synchronization information in the process. AV-HuBERT can be a useful pre-trained model for lip-reading, which has not been adopted by AV-TSE. In this paper, we would like to explore the way to integrate a pre-trained AV-HuBERT into our AV-TSE system. We have good reasons to expect an improved performance. To benefit from the inter and intra-modality correlations, we also propose a novel Mask-And-Recover (MAR) strategy for self-supervised learning. The experimental results on the VoxCeleb2 dataset show that our proposed model outperforms the baselines both in terms of subjective and objective metrics, suggesting that the pre-trained AV-HuBERT model provides more informative visual cues for target speech extraction. Furthermore, through a comparative study, we confirm that the proposed Mask-And-Recover strategy is significantly effective.</description>

      <title>Modeling Analog Dynamic Range Compressors using Deep Learning and State-space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel approach for developing realistic digital models of dynamic range compressors for digital audio production by analyzing their analog prototypes. While realistic digital dynamic compressors are potentially useful for many applications, the design process is challenging because the compressors operate nonlinearly over long time scales. Our approach is based on the structured state space sequence model (S4), as implementing the state-space model (SSM) has proven to be efficient at learning long-range dependencies and is promising for modeling dynamic range compressors. We present in this paper a deep learning model with S4 layers to model the Teletronix LA-2A analog dynamic range compressor. The model is causal, executes efficiently in real time, and achieves roughly the same quality as previous deep-learning models but with fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Training Generative Adversarial Network-Based Vocoder with Limited Data Using Augmentation-Conditional Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoder trained with an adversarial discriminator is commonly used for speech synthesis because of its fast, lightweight, and high-quality characteristics. However, this data-driven model requires a large amount of training data incurring high data-collection costs. This fact motivates us to train a GAN-based vocoder on limited data. A promising solution is to augment the training data to avoid overfitting. However, a standard discriminator is unconditional and insensitive to distributional changes caused by data augmentation. Thus, augmented speech (which can be extraordinary) may be considered real speech. To address this issue, we propose an augmentation-conditional discriminator (AugCondD) that receives the augmentation state as input in addition to speech, thereby assessing the input speech according to the augmentation state, without inhibiting the learning of the original non-augmented distribution. Experimental results indicate that AugCondD improves speech quality under limited data conditions while achieving comparable speech quality under sufficient data conditions. Audio samples are available at https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/people/kaneko.takuhiro/projects/augcondd/.</description>

      <title>Towards auditory attention decoding with noise-tagging: A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to extract from brain activity the attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch speech stimuli that were amplitude modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple speakers are presented simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Distributed collaborative anomalous sound detection by embedding sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To develop a machine sound monitoring system, a method for detecting anomalous sound is proposed. In this paper, we explore a method for multiple clients to collaboratively learn an anomalous sound detection model while keeping their raw data private from each other. In the context of industrial machine anomalous sound detection, each client possesses data from different machines or different operational states, making it challenging to learn through federated learning or split learning. In our proposed method, each client calculates embeddings using a common pre-trained model developed for sound data classification, and these calculated embeddings are aggregated on the server to perform anomalous sound detection through outlier exposure. Experiments showed that our proposed method improves the AUC of anomalous sound detection by an average of 6.8%.</description>

      <title>As Good As A Coin Toss Human detection of AI-generated images, videos, audio, and audiovisual stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today, the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an effective counterdefense.</description>

      <title>VoiceCraft: Zero-Shot Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS, our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles, recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular, for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and realistic dataset named RealEdit. We encourage readers to listen to the demos at https://jasonppy.github.io/VoiceCraft_web.</description>

      <title>An Audio-Visual Speech Separation Model Inspired by Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-visual approaches involving visual inputs have laid the foundation for recent progress in speech separation. However, the optimization of the concurrent usage of auditory and visual inputs is still an active research area. Inspired by the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit, in which the sensory processing mechanisms of different modalities modulate one another via the non-lemniscal sensory thalamus, we propose a novel cortico-thalamo-cortical neural network (CTCNet) for audio-visual speech separation (AVSS). First, the CTCNet learns hierarchical auditory and visual representations in a bottom-up manner in separate auditory and visual subnetworks, mimicking the functions of the auditory and visual cortical areas. Then, inspired by the large number of connections between cortical regions and the thalamus, the model fuses the auditory and visual information in a thalamic subnetwork through top-down connections. Finally, the model transmits this fused information back to the auditory and visual subnetworks, and the above process is repeated several times. The results of experiments on three speech separation benchmark datasets show that CTCNet remarkably outperforms existing AVSS methods with considerably fewer parameters. These results suggest that mimicking the anatomical connectome of the mammalian brain has great potential for advancing the development of deep neural networks.

      <title>BigVSAN: Enhancing GAN-based Neural Vocoders with Slicing Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoders have been intensively studied because they can synthesize high-fidelity audio waveforms faster than real-time. However, it has been reported that most GANs fail to obtain the optimal projection for discriminating between real and fake data in the feature space. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that slicing adversarial network (SAN), an improved GAN training framework that can find the optimal projection, is effective in the image generation task. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SAN in the vocoding task. For this purpose, we propose a scheme to modify least-squares GAN, which most GAN-based vocoders adopt, so that their loss functions satisfy the requirements of SAN. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that SAN can improve the performance of GAN-based vocoders, including BigVGAN, with small modifications. Our code is available at https://github.com/sony/bigvsan.</description>

      <title>Spiking-LEAF: A Learnable Auditory front-end for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated great potential for temporal signal processing. However, their performance in speech processing remains limited due to the lack of an effective auditory front-end. To address this limitation, we introduce Spiking-LEAF, a learnable auditory front-end meticulously designed for SNN-based speech processing. Spiking-LEAF combines a learnable filter bank with a novel two-compartment spiking neuron model called IHC-LIF. The IHC-LIF neurons draw inspiration from the structure of inner hair cells (IHC) and they leverage segregated dendritic and somatic compartments to effectively capture multi-scale temporal dynamics of speech signals. Additionally, the IHC-LIF neurons incorporate the lateral feedback mechanism along with spike regularization loss to enhance spike encoding efficiency. On keyword spotting and speaker identification tasks, the proposed Spiking-LEAF outperforms both SOTA spiking auditory front-ends and conventional real-valued acoustic features in terms of classification accuracy, noise robustness, and encoding efficiency.</description>

      <title>A unified front-end framework for English text-to-speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The front-end is a critical component of English text-to-speech (TTS) systems, responsible for extracting linguistic features that are essential for a text-to-speech model to synthesize speech, such as prosodies and phonemes. The English TTS front-end typically consists of a text normalization (TN) module, a prosody word prosody phrase (PWPP) module, and a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) module. However, current research on the English TTS front-end focuses solely on individual modules, neglecting the interdependence between them and resulting in sub-optimal performance for each module. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified front-end framework that captures the dependencies among the English TTS front-end modules. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all modules.</description>
