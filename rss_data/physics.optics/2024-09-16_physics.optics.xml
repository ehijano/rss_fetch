      <title>Light Transmission Through Two Dimensional Magneto-Optical Slit Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, metallic behavior of magneto optic materials in slit arrays under the incident of TM wave is analyzed by mode matching technique and confirmed by full wave simulations. It is shown that tensor electric permittivity of such materials under a static magnetic field bias can result in negative effective permittivity and if placed in a periodic two dimensional structure known as slit array, results in extraordinary optical transmission. It is also shown that this structure acts as a highly frequency selective surface tunable with magnetic bias change.</description>

      <title>Overcoming stress limitations in SiN nonlinear photonics via a bilayer waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) formed via low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is an ideal material platform for on-chip nonlinear photonics owing to its low propagation loss and competitive nonlinear index. Despite this, LPCVD SiN is restricted in its scalability due to the film stress when high thicknesses, required for nonlinear dispersion engineering, are deposited. This stress in turn leads to film cracking and makes integrating such films in silicon foundries challenging. To overcome this limitation, we propose a bilayer waveguide scheme comprised of a thin LPCVD SiN layer underneath a low-stress and low-index PECVD SiN layer. We show group velocity dispersion tuning at 1550nm without concern for filmcracking while enabling low loss resonators with intrinsic quality factors above 1 million. Finally, we demonstrate a locked, normal dispersion Kerr frequency comb with our bilayer waveguide resonators spanning 120nm in the c-band with an on-chip pump power of 350mW.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multiplexed Metasurfaces for Multi-Task Learning with All-Optical Diffractive Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive Neural Networks (DNNs) leverage the power of light to enhance computational performance in machine learning, offering a pathway to high-speed, low-energy, and large-scale neural information processing. However, most existing DNN architectures are optimized for single tasks and thus lack the flexibility required for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks within a unified artificial intelligence platform. In this work, we utilize the polarization and wavelength degrees of freedom of light to achieve optical multi-task identification using the MNIST, FMNIST, and KMNIST datasets. Employing bilayer cascaded metasurfaces, we construct dual-channel DNNs capable of simultaneously classifying two tasks, using polarization and wavelength multiplexing schemes through a meta-atom library. Numerical evaluations demonstrate performance accuracies comparable to those of individually trained single-channel, single-task DNNs. Extending this approach to three-task parallel recognition reveals an expected performance decline yet maintains satisfactory classification accuracies of greater than 80% for all tasks. We further introduce a novel end-to-end joint optimization framework to redesign the three-task classifier, demonstrating substantial improvements over the meta-atom library design and offering the potential for future multi-channel DNN designs. Our study could pave the way for the development of ultrathin, high-speed, and high-throughput optical neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>Scattering-free plasmonic Brewster effect via metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brewster effect, dating back to the pioneering work of Sir David Brewster in 1815, offers a crucial route to achieve 100% energy conversion between the incident and transmitted propagating waves at an optical interface and is of fundamental importance to many practical applications, such as polarization filtering, beam steering, and optical broadband angular selectivity. However, whether the Brewster effect of surface waves can be implemented without the involvement of negative-permittivity or negative-permeability materials remains elusive. This is due to the formidable challenge to fully suppress both the parasitic scattering into propagating waves and the reflection into surface waves under the incidence of surface waves. Here, we reveal a feasible route to achieve scattering-free plasmonic Brewster effect via isotropic metasurfaces, along with the usage of positive-permittivity and positive-permeability metamaterials with both anisotropic and magnetic responses. In essence, the anisotropic response of metamaterials is judiciously designed to fully suppress the parasitic scattering into propagating waves, while the magnetic response of metamaterials facilitates the full suppression of the reflection into surface waves supported by metasurfaces. Moreover, we find that this plasmonic Brewster effect via metasurfaces can be further engineered to occur for arbitrary incident angles, giving rise to the exotic phenomenon of all-angle scattering-free plasmonic Brewster effect.</description>

      <title>End-to-end metasurface design for temperature imaging via broadband Planck-radiation regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for temperature imaging from long-wavelength infrared thermal radiation (e.g. 8-12 $\mu$m) through the end-to-end design of a metasurface-optics frontend and a computational-reconstruction backend. We introduce a new nonlinear reconstruction algorithm, ``Planck regression," that reconstructs the temperature map from a grayscale sensor image, even in the presence of severe chromatic aberration, by exploiting blackbody and optical physics particular to thermal imaging. We combine this algorithm with an end-to-end approach that optimizes a manufacturable, single-layer metasurface to yield the most accurate reconstruction. Our designs demonstrate high-quality, noise-robust reconstructions of arbitrary temperature maps (including completely random images) in simulations of an ultra-compact thermal-imaging device. We also show that Planck regression is much more generalizable to arbitrary images than a straightforward neural-network reconstruction, which requires a large training set of domain-specific images.</description>

      <title>Confocal Raman Microscopy with Adaptive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confocal Raman microscopy, a highly specific and label-free technique for the microscale study of thick samples, often presents difficulties due to weak Raman signals. Inhomogeneous samples introduce wavefront aberrations that further reduce these signals, requiring even longer acquisition times. In this study, we introduce adaptive optics to confocal Raman microscopy for the first time to counteract such aberrations, significantly increasing the Raman signal and image quality. The method is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing commercial microscopes without hardware modifications. It uses a wavefront sensorless approach to derive aberrations using an optofluidic, transmissive spatial light modulator that can be attached to the microscope nosepiece. Our experimental results demonstrate the compensation of aberrations caused by artificial scatterers and mouse brain tissue, improving spatial resolution and achieving up to 3.5-fold signal enhancements. Our results provide a basis for the molecular label-free study of biological systems at greater imaging depths.</description>

      <title>Quadrature amplitude modulation for electronic sideband Pound-Drever-Hall locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is routinely used to stabilize the frequency of a laser to a reference cavity. The electronic sideband (ESB) locking scheme, a PDH variant, helps bridge the frequency difference between the quantized frequencies enforced by the cavity and the laser frequency of interest. Here we use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a technique used in digital signal communication, to engineer the high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signal required for ESB locking scheme. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effects of in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) impairments on the ESB error signal for ultra-narrow linewidth lasers. We design and implement two baseband-sampling software-defined radio variants for implementing QAM that compensate for these I/Q impairments. Using these variants, we engineer high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signals with a large phase modulation index of 1.01 radians, a maximum modulation frequency of 3 MHz, a tunable carrier wave frequency range of 450 MHz to 4 GHz, and I/Q errors of less than 2.25 % over the entire carrier wave frequency range.</description>

      <title>Towards Precise 3D Quantum Control of a Levitated Dipolar Scatterer using Spatial Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An essential requirement for universal quantum control of the centre-of-mass motion of levitated objects is the development of a precise readout of all three translational degrees of freedom. Improving that precision presents one key challenge: collecting all the information on the object's position, encoded in the scattered light, equivalent to minimising the measurement imprecision. Here, we propose a new detection technique based on spatial mode decomposition, which addresses this problem using a simple integrated setup, where all of the light back-scattered from a levitated nanoparticle couples into a spatial mode sorter. We observe that each mode of the sorter pairs predominantly to the in-elastically scattered field generated by the object's motion along a particular spatial axis. This results in each translational degree of freedom being selectively encoded in the amplitude of orthogonal information channels. Using this approach, we report measurement efficiencies ($\eta_{\mathrm{tot}}^x$, $\eta_{\mathrm{tot}}^y$, $\eta_{\mathrm{tot}}^z$) = (0.17, 0.15, 0.30), implying that our technique is capable of reaching the 3D quantum ground state.</description>

      <title>Two-step phase-shifting interferometry for phase-resolved imaging from a spatial light modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate two-step phase-shifting interferometry (holography) of complex laser modes generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM), in which the amplitude and phase of the signal are determined directly from measurements of phase-shifted interferograms. The reference and signal beams are generated and phase-controlled with a single composite hologram on the SLM and propagated collinearly. This requires no additional optics and leads to measurements that are more accurate and less prone to noise, which we demonstrate with collinearly-referenced measurements of various Laguerre-Gaussian modes and structured images.</description>

      <title>Single-photon detectors on arbitrary photonic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting non-classical light is a central requirement for photonics-based quantum technologies. Unrivaled high efficiencies and low dark counts have positioned superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) as the leading detector technology for fiber and integrated photonic applications. However, a central challenge lies in their integration within photonic integrated circuits regardless of material platform or surface topography. Here, we introduce a method based on transfer printing that overcomes these constraints and allows for the integration of SNSPDs onto arbitrary photonic substrates. We prove this by integrating SNSPDs and showing through-waveguide single-photon detection in commercially manufactured silicon and lithium niobate on insulator integrated photonic circuits. Our method eliminates bottlenecks to the integration of high-quality single-photon detectors, turning them into a versatile and accessible building block for scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Improving Analog Neural Network Robustness: A Noise-Agnostic Approach with Explainable Regularizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles the critical challenge of mitigating "hardware noise" in deep analog neural networks, a major obstacle in advancing analog signal processing devices. We propose a comprehensive, hardware-agnostic solution to address both correlated and uncorrelated noise affecting the activation layers of deep neural models. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to demystify the "black box" nature of noise-resilient networks by revealing the underlying mechanisms that reduce sensitivity to noise. In doing so, we introduce a new explainable regularization framework that harnesses these mechanisms to significantly enhance noise robustness in deep neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Realizing topologically protected ghost surface polaritons by lattice transformation optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While conventional surface waves propagate along the surface and decay perpendicularly from the interface, the ghost surface polaritons show oblique propagation direction with respect to the interface. Here, we have discovered topologically protected ghost surface polaritons by applying the lattice transformation optics method to gyromagnetic photonic crystals. By introducing the transformation optics method to periodic systems, we develop the lattice transformation optics method to engineer the band structures and propagation directions of the surface polaritons. We show that a simple shear transformation on the square lattice can tailor the propagation directions with ease. The reversed ghost surface polariton is discovered by setting a negative shear factor. Interestingly, we find the topological invariant Chern number will change sign when the orientation of the Brillouin zone flipped during the transformation. Our findings open up new avenues for studying ghost surface polaritons and provide a general engineering method for periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven lensless fiber endomicroscopic quantitative phase imaging towards digital pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensless fiber endomicroscope is an emerging tool for in-vivo microscopic imaging, where quantitative phase imaging (QPI) can be utilized as a label-free method to enhance image contrast. However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>An effective and reliable approach to the phase problem in single-shot single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to get images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. Thanks to the extremely bright and short coherent light pulses provided by X-ray Free Electron Lasers, CDI makes it possible to study nanostructures in the gas phase and get time-resolved snapshots of their ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented resolution. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. We present the Memetic Phase Retrieval (MPR) method, an improved approach to the phase retrieval problem, which makes use of a combination of existing phase retrieval algorithms and evolutionary algorithms to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional approaches. We benchmark the method on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal considerable stability of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in challenging conditions. A user-friendly implementation of the MPR method is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the FEL imaging community.</description>

      <title>Quantum electrodynamical formulation of photochemical acid generation and its implications on optical lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.12598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photochemical acid generation is refined from the first principles of quantum electrodynamics. First, we briefly review the formulation of the quantum theory of light based on the quantum electrodynamics framework to establish the probability of acid generation at a given spacetime point. The quantum-mechanical acid generation is then combined with the deprotection mechanism to obtain a probabilistic description of the deprotection density directly related to feature formation in a photoresist. A statistical analysis of the random deprotection density is presented to reveal the leading characteristics of stochastic feature formation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-secure multiparty deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</description>
