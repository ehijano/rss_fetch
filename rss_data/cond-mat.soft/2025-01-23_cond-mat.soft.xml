      <title>Director-layer dynamics in the smectic-ZA phase of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the anti-ferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.</description>

      <title>On the nature of rubber wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rubber wear results from the removal of small (micrometer-sized) rubber particles through crack propagation. In this study, we investigate the wear behavior of Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) and Natural Rubber (NR) sliding on two different concrete surfaces under dry and wet conditions. Experiments were conducted at low sliding speeds ($\approx 1 \ {\rm mm/s}$) to minimize frictional heating and hydrodynamic effects. For two SBR compounds, we observe significantly higher wear rates in water compared to the dry state, with enhancement factors of $1.5-2.5$ for a low-glass-transition-temperature SBR compound ($T_{\rm g} = -50^\circ {\rm C}$) and approximately $4$ for a higher-glass-transition compound ($T_{\rm g} = -7^\circ {\rm C}$). In contrast, the NR compound showed no wear in water at low nominal contact pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.12$, $0.16$, and $0.25 \ {\rm MPa}$), while at higher pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.36$ and $0.49 \ {\rm MPa}$), the wear rates in dry and wet states were similar. The experimental results are analyzed using a recently developed rubber wear theory. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of rubber wear under varying environmental and mechanical conditions, highlighting the influence of material properties, interfacial effects, and applied pressures on wear behavior.</description>

      <title>Stretching the Printability Metric in Direct-ink Writing with Highly Extensible Yield-Stress Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-ink writing leverages the rheological complexity of yield-stress fluids to construct complex geometries, particularly those with large gaps across internal structures. However, extensional rheological properties have rarely been considered in work that studies rheology-printability correlations. Here, we test our hypothesis that extensional properties correlate with drawability, a key indicator of printability that signifies speed robustness, printing resolution, and gap-spanning performance. We formulated cementitious suspensions using hydroxyapatite (HAp) particles, independently tuning them for yield stress and extensibility, two crucial rheological properties, and test-printed. To enhance extensibility, we incorporated hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as a polymeric modifier, but this enhancement may decrease as yield stress increases, presenting a challenge in materials design. We modulated particle interactions to achieve a wide range of yield stress and extensibility, allowing for rigorous testing of our hypothesis. This approach created inks with high extensibility and high yield stress, generally considered mutually exclusive properties. We evaluated correlations between drawability and key rheological properties, finding the strongest positive correlation with extensional failure strains (strain-to-break) rather than yield stress. We establish a bijective property-manufacturing relationship (one-on-one mapping of shear yield stress to buildability and extensional strain-to-break to drawability) by combining our findings on drawability with previous studies on buildability. This relationship provides a comprehensive framework for designing high-performance inks that can be self-supporting, capable of high-speed printing, and allow gap-spanning features.</description>

      <title>Open questions on defining and computing the vapour-liquid surface tension by virial and test transformation approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses four problems in defining and computing the surface tension of vapour-liquid interfaces: (1) The apparent kinetic contribution to the surface tension, and what it is that makes it appear; (2) the problem of defining the local virial, which for some purposes appears to be necessary; (3) the disagreement between results for spherical interfaces when using different methods, specifically the virial and the test area method; (4) how the surface tension values obtained from these methods can be related to the definition of the surface tension from thermodynamics - since if they cannot, it is a meaningless exercise to compute them. At the end, all these problems remain unsolved: They are "open questions."</description>

      <title>Local slip length and surfactant effects on liquid-infused surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust surfaces capable of reducing flow drag, controlling heat and mass transfer, and resisting fouling in fluid flows are important for various applications. In this context, textured surfaces impregnated with a liquid lubricant show promise due to their ability to sustain a liquid-liquid layer that induces slippage. However, theoretical and numerical studies suggest that the slippage can be compromised by surfactants in the overlying fluid, which contaminate the liquid-liquid interface and generate Marangoni stresses. In this study, we use Doppler-optical coherence tomography, an interferometric imaging technique, combined with numerical simulations to investigate how surfactants influence the slip length of lubricant-infused surfaces with longitudinal grooves in a laminar flow. We introduce surfactants by adding tracer particles (milk) to the working fluid (water). Local measurements of slip length at the liquid-liquid interface are significantly smaller than theoretical predictions for clean interfaces (Sch\"onecker &amp; Hardt 2013). In contrast, measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of fully immobilized interfaces, indicating that milk particles adsorbed at the interface are responsible for the reduction in slippage. This work provides the first experimental evidence that liquid-liquid interfaces within textured surfaces can become immobilized in the presence of surfactants and flow.</description>

      <title>Condensate Size Control by Net Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising diverse molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Essentially, droplets expel ions, so they cannot screen electrostatics effectively, implying droplets acquire a net charge and cannot grow indefinitely. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Self-organization and memory in an disordered solid subject to random loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider self-organization and memory formation in a mesoscopic model of an amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We develop proper read-out protocols to show that the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range, which can be subsequently retrieved. Our findings generalize previous results obtained upon oscillatory driving and suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a disordered system interacting with its fluctuating environment. The self-organization results in a correlation between the dynamics of the system and its environment. We conclude by discussing our results within the context of environmental sensing, highlighting their generalizability to adaptation strategies of simple organisms under changing conditions.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. We demonstrate that statistical errors due to insufficient sampling are substantial and propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</description>

      <title>Knit Happens: Designing the Mechanics of Machine Knitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.</description>

      <title>Rheology of concentrated suspension of fibers with load dependent friction coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effects of fiber aspect ratio, roughness, flexibility, and flow inertia on the rheology of concentrated suspensions. We perform direct numerical simulations modeling the fibers, suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, as continuous flexible slender bodies obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. An immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is employed to solve for the motion of fibers. In concentrated suspensions, fibers come into contact due to the presence of asperities on their surface. We assume a normal load-dependent friction coefficient to model contact dynamics and friction, which successfully recovers the shear-thinning behaviour observed in experiments. First, we report the shear rate dependent behavior and the increase in the suspension viscosity with the increasing volume fraction of fibers, fiber roughness, and rigidity. The increase in the viscosity is stronger at a lower shear rate and finite inertia. Simulation results indicate that for the concentrated suspensions, contact stresses between fibers form the dominant contribution to the viscosity. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive and to increase with the Reynolds number for flexible fibers. Lastly, we explore the divergence of viscosity for different aspect ratios and roughness of the fibers and predict the jamming volume fraction by fitting the data to the Maron-Pierce law. The jamming volume fraction decreases with increasing the aspect ratio and roughness. We conclude that the contact forces and interparticle friction become one of the crucial factors governing the rheology of flexible fiber suspensions at high concentrations.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we introduced a new scaling method based on Adam-Gibbs model. Moreover, generalised critical-like expression of configurational entropy S_C (T)=S_0 (1-T_K/T)^n is used. Obtained values of pseudocritical exponent n seem to be universal for studied systems and corresponds well with thermodynamic data. Relation between dynamic portrayal represented by primary relaxation time and thermodynamic (specific heat capacity) is in a good agreement.</description>

      <title>Correlation decoupling of Casimir interaction in an electrolyte driven by external electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$. At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at large applied fields.</description>
