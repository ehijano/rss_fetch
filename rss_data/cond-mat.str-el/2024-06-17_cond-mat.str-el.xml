      <title>Origin of Distinct Insulating Domains in the Layered Charge Density Wave Material 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical charge order shapes the electronic properties in layered charge density wave (CDW) materials. Various stacking orders inevitably create nanoscale domains with distinct electronic structures inaccessible to bulk probes. Here, the stacking characteristics of bulk 1$T$-TaS$2$ are analyzed using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is observed that Mott-insulating domains undergo a transition to band-insulating domains restoring vertical dimerization of the CDWs. Furthermore, STS measurements covering a wide terrace reveal two distinct band insulating domains differentiated by band edge broadening. These DFT calculations reveal that the Mott insulating layers preferably reside on the subsurface, forming broader band edges in the neighboring band insulating layers. Ultimately, buried Mott insulating layers believed to harbor the quantum spin liquid phase are identified. These results resolve persistent issues regarding vertical charge order in 1$T$-TaS$2$, providing a new perspective for investigating emergent quantum phenomena in layered CDW materials.</description>

      <title>A Novel Perspective on Ideal Chern Bands with Strong Short-Range Repulsion: Applications to Correlated Metals, Superconductivity, and Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on twisted van der Waals materials, we perform an analytical and numerical study of the effects of strong on-site and short-range interactions in fractionally filled ideal Chern bands. We uncover an extensive non-trivial ground state manifold within the band filling range $0 &lt; \nu &lt; 1$ and introduce a general principle, the ''three-rule'', for combining flatband wave functions, which governs their zero-energy property on the torus geometry. Based on the structure of these wave functions, we develop a variational approach that reveals distinct phases under different perturbations: metallic behavior emerges from a finite dispersion, and superconductivity is induced by attractive Cooper channel interactions. Our approach, not reliant on the commonly applied mean-field approximations, provides an analytical expression for the macroscopic wave function of the off-diagonal long-range order correlator, attributing pairing susceptibility to the set of non-trivial zero-energy ground state wave functions. Extending to finite screening lengths and beyond the ideal limit using exact diagonalization simulations, we demonstrate the peculiar structure in the many-body wave function's coefficients to be imprinted in the low-energy spectrum of the topologically ordered Halperin spin-singlet state. Our findings also make connections to frustration-free models of non-commuting projector Hamiltonians, potentially aiding the future construction of exact ground states for various fractional fillings.</description>

      <title>Monopole magnetohydrodynamics on a plane: Magnetosonic waves and dynamo instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems can host emergent `vacua' with particles, fields and dimension different from that of the universe we inhabit. Motivated by the appearance of emergent gauge fields with both electric and magnetic charges, we consider the fate of electromagnetism in two dimensions in such a setting. We find that generically electromagnetic fields are damped due to resistive effects. However, we can still identify a magnetohydrodynamic regime. It exhibits magnetosonic waves which, unlike in $d=3$, are isotropic, to which there is a contribution from the odd viscosity coefficient present in the system. Further, we find a dynamo action, which unlike in $d=3$ requires compressibility of the flow.</description>

      <title>Theories for charge-driven nematicity in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a low-energy model for the band dispersion of the $2 \times 2$ charge-ordered phase of the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs), we show that nematicity can develop in this state driven either by $4 \times 4$ charge fluctuations preemptive of a $1 \times 4$ charge order (CO), or by an actual zero momentum $d$-wave charge Pomeranchuk instability (PI). We perform an analysis that starts from a Kohn-Luttinger theory in the particle-hole sector, which allows us to establish a criterion for the development of an attractive nematic channel near the onset of the $1 \times 4$ CO and near the $d$-wave charge PI, respectively. We derive an effective charge-fermion model for the $d$-wave PI with a nematic susceptibility given via a random phase approximation (RPA) summation. By contrast, for the finite momentum CO, the RPA scheme breaks down and needs to be improved upon by including Aslamazov-Larkin contributions to the nematic pairing vertex. We then move to the derivation of the Ginzburg-Landau potentials for the $4 \times 4$ CO and for the $d$-wave PI, and we obtain the corresponding expression for the nematic susceptibility at the nematic transition temperature T $ \sim \text{T}_\text{nem}$ in both cases. Our work establishes a relation between the nematicity observed in some of the iron-based superconductors, where the nematic phase might be driven by spin fluctuations, and the vanadium-based kagome metals, where charge fluctuations likely induce nematicity. The two microscopic mechanisms we propose for the stabilization of the nematic state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ are distinguishable by diffusive scattering experiments, meaning that it is possible to gauge which of the two theories, if any, is the most likely to describe this phase. Both mechanisms might also be relevant for the recently discovered titanium-based family $A$Ti$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling behavior of resistivity under two-dimensional superconducting phase fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconductors with relatively low superfluid density, such as cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter are remarkable, presumably playing a nonnegligible role in shaping many distinctive physical properties. This work systematically investigates the electrical transport properties arising from thermal superconducting phase fluctuations in two-dimensional superconductors. Employing the Monte Carlo procedure, we access the numerically exact properties of a microscopic model of superconductivity, in which the classical XY model governs the thermal phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter. For both $s$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairings, the electrical resistivity exhibits a universal scaling behavior in the temperature range above $T_c$. Our numerical results demonstrate that the scaling behavior of the quasiparticle lifetime is associated with the correlation length of the superconducting order parameter, yielding the universal scaling behavior of electrical resistivity determined by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical scaling of the correlation length. Furthermore, we discuss the dependence of the electrical resistivity coefficient on the pairing amplitude and the possible implication on recent transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal quasi-Fermi liquid physics of one-dimensional interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum Griffiths singularity in bulk iron-pnictide superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) is a phenomenon driven by quenched disorders that break conventional scaling invariance and result in a divergent dynamical critical exponent during quantum phase transitions (QPT). While this phenomenon has been well-documented in low-dimensional conventional superconductors and in three-dimensional (3D) magnetic metal systems, its presence in 3D superconducting systems and in unconventional high-temperature superconductors (high-Tc SCs) remains unclear. In this study, we report the observation of robust QGS in the superconductor-metal transition (SMT) of both quasi-2D and 3D anisotropic unconventional high-Tc superconductor CaFe1-xNixAsF (x &lt; 5%) bulk single crystals, where the QGS states persist to up to 5.3 K. A comprehensive quantum phase diagram is established that delineates the 3D anisotropic QGS of SMT induced by perpendicular and parallel magnetic field. Our findings reveal the universality of QGS in 3D superconducting systems and unconventional high-Tc SCs, thereby substantially expanding the range of applicability of QGS.</description>

      <title>Highly-entangled stationary states from strong symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian conserved quantities can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, R\'enyi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or to the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U($1$) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU$(N)$ symmetries, both logarithmic and R\'enyi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that while R\'enyi negativities with $n&gt;2$ scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized R\'enyi negativities with $n&lt;2$) exhibits a volume law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems, and hence also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism and Topology of the Higher Flat Band in a Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e fractional Chern insulators (FCI) provides opportunities for investigating zero magnetic field anyons. So far, both experimental and theoretical results suggest that filling &gt; 1/3 FCI states in the first Chern band share features with those of the lowest Landau level (LL). To create the possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons, one route is to engineer higher flat Chern bands that mimic higher LLs. Here, we investigate the interaction, topology, and ferromagnetism of the second moir\'e miniband in twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2). Around filling factor v = -3, i.e., half-filling of the second miniband, we uncover spontaneous ferromagnetism and an incipient Chern insulator state. By measuring the anomalous Hall effect as a function of twist angle, we find that the Chern numbers (C) of the top two moir\'e flat bands have opposite sign (C = -+1) at twist angles above 3.1{\deg} but the same sign (C = -1) around 2.6{\deg}. This observation is consistent with the recently predicted twist-angle dependent band topology, resulting from the competition between moir\'e ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. As we increase the magnetic field, only the small twist-angle device (2.6{\deg}) experiences a topological phase transition with an emergent C = -2 state. This is attributed to a Zeeman field-induced band crossing between opposite valleys, with the determined C = -1 for the top two bands. Our results lay a firm foundation for understanding the higher flat Chern bands, which is essential for the prediction or discovery of non-Abelian FCIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the modulation of carrier density can alter the superconducting transition temperature by up to $204$ mK in epitaxial Indium Nitride on Gallium Nitride, accounting for the $10$% of the transition temperature in ungated conditions. Our samples are likely free from strong localization effects and significant granularity, as indicated by $( k_{f l} \gg 1 )$, suggesting that the primary determinant of the transition temperature in InN is carrier density, rather than disorder scattering. The observed behavior is consistent with BCS s-wave superconductivity, corroborated by the superconducting parameters we measured. Furthermore, we observed a $60$% bipolar suppression of the supercurrent in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and correlations in the second moir\'e band of twisted bilayer MoTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological flat bands formed in two-dimensional lattice systems offer unique opportunity to study the fractional phases of matter in the absence of an external magnetic field. Celebrated examples include fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects and fractional topological insulators. Recently, FQAH effects have been experimentally realized in both the twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2) system and the rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene/hBN moir\'e systems. To date, experimental studies mainly focus on the first moir\'e flat band, except a very recent work that reported the evidence of the integer and fractional quantum spin Hall effects in higher moir\'e bands of a 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. Here, we present the systematical transport study of approximately 3{\deg} tMoTe2 devices, especially for the second moir\'e band. At {\nu} = -2 and -4, time-reversal-symmetric single and double quantum spin Hall states formed, consistent with the previous observation in 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. On the other hand, we observed ferromagnetism in the second moir\'e band, and a Chern insulator state driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields at {\nu} = -3. At {\nu} = -2.5, nonmonotonic temperature dependence of resistivity and large out-of-plane negative magnetoresistance have been observed, which likely arises from the frustrated liquid-like ground state and weak effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions. Applying out-of-plane electric field can induce quantum phase transitions at both integer and fractional filling factors. Our studies pave the way for realizing tunable topological states and other unexpected magnetic phases beyond the first moir\'e flat band based on twisted MoTe2 platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Magnetic Transition Temperatures and the Rare Earth Exchange Interaction in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09937v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of functional oxide heterostructures are strongly influenced by the physics governing their interfaces. Modern deposition techniques allow us to accurately engineer the interface physics through the growth of atomically precise heterostructures. This enables minute control over the electronic, magnetic, and structural characteristics. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of tailor-made superlattices employing the ferromagnetic and insulating double perovskites RE$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (RE = La, Nd), featuring distinct Curie temperatures. Adjusting the superlattice periodicity at the unit cell level allows us to engineer their magnetic phase diagram. Large periodicity superlattices conserve the individual para- to ferromagnetic transitions of the La$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ parent compounds. As the superlattice periodicity is reduced, the Curie temperatures of the superlattice constituents converge and, finally, collapse into one single transition for the lowest period samples. This is a consequence of the magnetic order parameter propagating across the superlattice interfaces, as supported by a minimal Landau theory model. Further, we find that the Nd-Ni/Mn exchange interaction can be enhanced by the superlattice interfaces. This leads to a field-induced reversal of the Nd magnetic moments, as confirmed by synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements and supported by first-principles calculations. Our work demonstrates how superlattice engineering can be employed to fine-tune the magnetic properties in oxide heterostructures and broadens our understanding of magnetic interfacial effects.</description>

      <title>Non-Unitary Quantum Many-Body Dynamics using the Faber Polynomial Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We comparatively study three of the most useful quantum information tools to detect quantum critical points (QCPs) when only finite temperature data are available. We investigate quantitatively how the quantum discord, the quantum teleportation based QCP detectors, and the quantum coherence spectrum pinpoint the QCPs of several spin-$1/2$ chains. We work in the thermodynamic limit (infinite number of spins) and with the spin chains in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T$. The models here studied are the $XXZ$ model with and without an external longitudinal magnetic field, the Ising transverse model, and the $XY$ model subjected to an external transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Impurities with a cusp: general theory and 3d Ising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In CFTs, the partition function of a line defect with a cusp depends logarithmically on the size of the line with an angle-dependent coefficient: the cusp anomalous dimension. In the first part of this work, we study the general properties of the cusp anomalous dimension. We relate the small cusp angle limit to the effective field theory of defect fusion, making predictions for the first couple of terms in the expansion. Using a concavity property of the cusp anomalous dimension we argue that the Casimir energy between a line defect and its orientation reversal is always negative ("opposites attract"). We use these results to determine the fusion algebra of Wilson lines in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM as well as pinning field defects in the Wilson-Fisher fixed points. In the second part of the paper we obtain nonperturbative numerical results for the cusp anomalous dimension of pinning field defects in the Ising model in $d=3$, using the recently developed fuzzy-sphere regularization. We also compute the pinning field cusp anomalous dimension in the $O(N)$ model at one-loop in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. Our results are in agreement with the general theory developed in the first part of the work, and we make several predictions for impurities in magnets.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <title>High conductivity from cross-band electron pairing in flat-band systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons in condensed matter may transition into a variety of broken-symmetry phase states due to electron-electron interactions. Applying diverse mean-field approximations to the interaction term is arguably the simplest way to identify the phase states theoretically possible in a given setting. Here, we explore electron-electron attraction in a two-band system comprising symmetric conduction and valence bands touching each other at a single point. We assume a mean-field pairing between the electrons having opposite spins, momenta, and, in contrast to the conventional superconducting pairing, residing in opposite bands, i.e., having opposite energies. We show that electrons transition into a novel correlated ground state if and only if the bands are flat enough, i.e. the transition is impossible in the case of conventional parabolic bands. Although this state is not superconducting in the usual sense and does not exhibit a gap in its excitation spectrum, it is nevertheless immune to elastic scattering caused by any kind of disorder, and is therefore expected to exhibit high electric conductivity at low temperature, mimicking the behavior of a real superconductor. Having in mind the recent experimental realizations of flat-band electronic systems in twisted multilayers, we foresee an exciting opportunity for observing a new class of highly conductive materials.</description>

      <title>The tilted-plane structure of the energy of finite quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The piecewise linearity condition on the total energy with respect to the total magnetization of finite quantum systems is derived, using the infinite-separation-limit technique. This generalizes the well-known constancy condition, related to static correlation error, in approximate density functional theory (DFT). The magnetic analog of the DFT Koopmans' theorem is also derived. Moving to fractional electron count, the tilted plane condition is derived, lifting certain assumptions in previous works. This generalization of the flat plane condition characterizes the total energy surface of a finite system for all values of electron count N and magnetization M. This result is used in combination with tabulated spectroscopic data to show the flat plane-structure of the oxygen atom, among others. We find that derivative discontinuities with respect to electron count sometimes occur at non-integer values. A diverse set of tilted plane structures is shown to occur in d-orbital subspaces, depending on chemical coordination. General occupancy-based total-energy expressions are demonstrated thereby to be necessarily dependent on the symmetry-imposed degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Emergent Quantum Phenomena of Noncentrosymmetric Charge-Density Wave in 1T-Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1T-transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have been an exciting platform for exploring the intertwinement of charge density waves and strong correlation phenomena. While the David star structure has been conventionally considered as the underlying charge order in the literature, recent scanning tunneling probe experiments on several monolayer 1T-TMD materials have motivated a new, alternative structure, namely the anion-centered David star structure. In this Letter, we show that this novel anion-centered David star structure manifestly breaks inversion symmetry, resulting in flat bands with pronounced Rashba spin-orbit couplings. These distinctive features unlock novel possibilities and functionalities for 1T-TMDs, including the giant spin Hall effect, the emergence of Chern bands, and spin liquid that spontaneously breaks crystalline rotational symmetry. Our findings establish promising avenues for exploring emerging quantum phenomena of monolayer 1T-TMDs with this novel noncentrosymmetric structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish low-temperature resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) spectroscopy as a tool to probe the formation of a series of moir\'e-bands in twisted WSe_{2} bilayers by accessing collective intermoir\'e-band excitations (IMBE). We observe resonances in RILS spectra at energies in agreement with inter-moir\'e band transitions obtained from an ab-initio based continuum model. Transitions between the first and second inter-moir\'e band for a twist angle of about 8{\deg} are reported and between first and second, third and higher bands for a twist of about 3{\deg}. The signatures from IMBE for the latter highlight a strong departure from parabolic bands with flat minibands exhibiting very high density of states in accord with theory. These observations allow to quantify the transition energies at the K-point where the states relevant for correlation physics are hosted.</description>

      <title>Second-order phase transitions and divergent linear response in dynamical mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order phase transitions appear as a divergence in one of the linear response functions. For a system of correlated electrons, the relevant divergent response can and does involve many-particle observables, most famously the double occupancy. Generally, evaluating the linear response function of many-particle observables requires a many-particle generalization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. However, here I show that the divergence of linear response functions in dynamical mean-field theory is governed by a two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equation, even for many-particle observables. The reason for this is that the divergence at the second-order phase transition is produced by the self-consistent feedback of the dynamical mean-field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the Shiba mapping on the two particle level, we derive the relation between the local four-point correlation functions of bipartite lattice models with on-site electronic repulsion and those of the corresponding models with attractive interaction in the most general setting. In particular, we extend the results of [Phys. Rev. B, 101, 155148 (2020)], which were limited to the rather specific situation of the static limit in strictly particle-hole symmetric models, (i) by explicitly including both magnetic field and different values of the chemical potentials, and (ii) by considering the full dependence of the generalized susceptibilities on the transfer (bosonic) Matsubara frequency. The derived formalism is then applied, as a relevant benchmark, to the Hubbard atom, by investigating the general properties of the divergences of its irreducible vertex functions as a function of chemical potential and applied magnetic field. The resulting phase-diagrams provide an insightful compass for future studies of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation expansion beyond high-symmetric regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [arXiv:2310.11193] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic ions in the thermal Hall effect of the paramagnetic insulator TmVO$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing number of materials, phonons have been found to generate a thermal Hall effect, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Inspired by previous studies that revealed the importance of Tb$^{3+}$ ions in generating the thermal Hall effect in a family of pyrochlores, we investigated the role of Tm$^{3+}$ ions in TmVO$_{4}$, a paramagnetic insulator with a different crystal structure. We observe a negative thermal Hall conductivity in TmVO$_{4}$ with a magnitude such that the Hall angle, $|\kappa_{xy}$/$\kappa_{xx}|$, is approximately 1 x 10$^{-3}$ at $H$ = 15 T and $T$ = 20 K, typical for a phonon-generated thermal Hall effect. In contrast to the negligible $\kappa_{xy}$ found in the nonmagnetic pyrochlore analog (where the Tb$^{3+}$ ions are replaced with Y$^{3+}$), we observe a negative $\kappa_{xy}$ in YVO$_{4}$ with a Hall angle of magnitude comparable to that of TmVO$_{4}$. This shows that the Tm$^{3+}$ ions are not essential for the thermal Hall effect in this family of materials. Interestingly, at an intermediate Y concentration of $x$ = 0.3 in Tm$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$VO$_{4}$, $\kappa_{xy}$ was found to have a positive sign, pointing to the importance of impurities in the thermal Hall effect of phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics induced by a local perturbation in fracton field theory. For the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ and ${\mathbb Z}_8$-symmetric free fractonic theories, we compute the time dynamics of several observables such as the two-point Green function, $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ condensate, energy density, and the dipole momentum. The time-dependent considerations highlight that the free fractonic theory breaks causality and exhibits instantaneous signal propagation, even if an additional relativistic term is included to enforce a speed limit in the system. We show that it is related to the fact that the Lieb-Robinson bound does not hold in the continuum limit of the fracton field theory, and the effective bounded speed of light does not emerge. For the theory in finite volume, we show that the fracton wave front acquires fractal shape with non-trivial Hausdorff dimension, and argue that this phenomenon cannot be explained by a simple self-interference effect.</description>

      <title>Depth resolved study of annealing in IrMn/(Fe, Co, CoFe) exchange bias systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth resolved study of structural and magnetic profiles of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic (AFM/FM) system upon annealing was performed in this work. We studied systems comprising of AFM IrMn and FM (Co, Fe, Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$) structures using polarized neutron and soft X-ray scattering, secondary neutral spectrometry, and magnetometry. Structural depth profiles obtained from neutron reflectometry indicate non-homogeneity of the AFM layer even before annealing, which is associated with the migration of manganese to the surface of the sample. Annealing of samples with CoFe and Co layers leads to a slight increase ($\sim$ 5 %) in the migration of manganese, which, however, does not lead to significant degradation of the exchange coupling at the AFM/FM interface. A significantly different picture was observed in the Fe/IrMn systems where a strong migration of iron into the AFM layer was observed upon annealing of the sample, leading to erosion of the magnetic profile, the formation of a non-magnetic alloy and degradation of the pinning strength. This study can be useful in the design of AF/FM systems in different spintronics devices, including HDD read heads, where thermal annealing is applied at different stages of the device manufacturing process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent reports of room-temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite, commonly referred to as LK99, have prompted numerous theoretical and experimental studies into its properties. As the electron-phonon interaction is a common mechanism for superconductivity, the electron-phonon coupling strength is an important quantity to compute for LK99. In this work, we compare the electron-phonon coupling strength among the proposed compositions of LK99. The results of our study are in alignment with the conclusion that LK99 is not a likely candidate for room-temperature superconductivity if electron-phonon interaction is to serve as the mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Addressing high-dimensional partial differential equations to derive effective actions within the functional renormalization group is formidable, especially when considering various field configurations, including inhomogeneous states, even on lattices. We leverage physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a state-of-the-art machine learning method for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations to overcome this challenge. In a zero-dimensional O($N$) model, we numerically demonstrate the construction of an effective action on an $N$-dimensional configuration space, extending up to $N=100$. Our results underscore the effectiveness of PINN approximation, even in scenarios lacking small parameters such as a small coupling.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov exponent as a signature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos</title>

Abstract: A distinct feature of Hermitian quantum chaotic dynamics is the exponential increase of certain out-of-time-order-correlation (OTOC) functions around the Ehrenfest time with a rate given by a Lyapunov exponent. Physically, the OTOCs describe the growth of quantum uncertainty that crucially depends on the nature of the quantum motion. Here, we employ the OTOC in order to provide a precise definition of dissipative quantum chaos. For this purpose, we compute analytically the Lyapunov exponent for the vectorized formulation of the large $q$-limit of a $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to a Markovian bath. These analytic results are confirmed by an explicit numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponent for several values of $q \geq 4$ based on the solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that the Lyapunov exponent decreases monotonically as the coupling to the bath increases and eventually becomes negative at a critical value of the coupling signaling a transition to a dynamics which is no longer quantum chaotic. Therefore, a positive Lyapunov exponent is a defining feature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos. The observation of the breaking of the exponential growth for sufficiently strong coupling suggests that dissipative quantum chaos may require in certain cases a sufficiently weak coupling to the environment.</description>
