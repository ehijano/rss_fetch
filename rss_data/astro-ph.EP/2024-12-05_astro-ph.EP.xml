      <title>History and Habitability of the LP 890-9 Planetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerous aspects of the evolution of the LP 890-9 (SPECULOOS-2/TOI-4306) planetary system, focusing on the likelihood that planet c can support life. We find that the host star reaches the main sequence in 1 Gyr and that planet c lies close to the inner boundary of the habitable zone. We find the magma ocean stage can last up to 50 Myr, remove 8 Earth-oceans of water, and leave up to 2000 bars of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, if the planet forms with a hydrogen envelope as small as 0.1 Earth-masses, no water will be lost during the star's pre-main sequence phase from thermal escape processes. We find that the planets are unlikely to be in a 3:1 mean motion resonance and that both planets tidally circularize within 0.5 Gyr when tidal dissipation is held constant. However, if tidal dissipation is a function of mantle temperature and rheology, then we find that planet c's orbit may require more than 7 Gyr to circularize, during which time tidal heating may reach hundreds of terawatts. We thus conclude that the habitability of planet c depends most strongly on the initial volatile content and internal properties, but no data yet preclude the viability of an active biosphere on the planet.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Characterization of an Eccentric, Warm Saturn Transiting the Solar Analog TOI-4994</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection and characterization of TOI-4994b (TIC 277128619b), a warm Saturn-sized planet discovered by the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI-4994b transits a G-type star (V = 12.6 mag) with a mass, radius, and effective temperature of $M_{\star} =1.005^{+0.064}_{-0.061} M_{\odot}$, $R_{\star} = 1.055^{+0.040}_{-0.037} R_{\odot}$, and $T_{\rm eff} = 5640 \pm 110$ K. We obtained follow-up ground-based photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and the Antarctic Search for Transiting ExoPlanets (ASTEP) telescopes, and we confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-4994b with multiple radial velocity observations from the PFS, CHIRON, HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE instruments. From a global fit to the photometry and radial velocities, we determine that TOI-4994b is in a 21.5-day, eccentric orbit ($e = 0.32 \pm 0.04$) and has a mass of $M_{P}= 0.280^{+0.037}_{-0.034} M_{J}$, a radius of $R_{P}= 0.762^{+0.030}_{-0.027}R_{J}$, and a Saturn-like bulk density of $\rho_{p} = 0.78^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ $\rm g/cm^3$. We find that TOI-4994 is a potentially viable candidate for follow-up stellar obliquity measurements. TOI-4994b joins the small sample of warm Saturn analogs and thus sheds light on our understanding of these rare and unique worlds.</description>

      <title>Accretion of Uranus and Neptune: confronting different giant impact scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of Uranus and Neptune are not fully understood. Their inclined rotation axes -- obliquities -- suggest that they experienced giant impacts during their formation histories. Simulations modeling their accretion from giant impacts among ~5 Earth masses planetary embryos -- with roughly unity impactors' mass ratios -- have been able to broadly match their current masses, final mass ratio, and obliquity. However, due to angular momentum conservation, planets produced in these impacts tend to rotate too fast, compared to Uranus and Neptune. One potential solution for this problem consists of invoking instead collisions of objects with large mass ratios (e.g. a proto-Uranus with 13 Mearth and an embryo of 1 Mearth). Smooth-particle hydrodynamics simulations show that in this scenario final planets tend to have rotation periods more consistent with those of Uranus and Neptune. Here we performed a large suite of N-body numerical simulations modelling the formation of Uranus and Neptune to compare these different dynamical views. Our simulations start with a population of protoplanets and account for the effects of type-I migration, inclination and eccentricity tidal damping. Our results show that although scenarios allowing for large impactors' mass ratio favour slower rotating planets, the probability of occurring collisions in these specific simulations is significantly low. This is because gas tidal damping is relatively less efficient for low-mass embryos (&lt;~1 Merath) and, consequently, such objects are mostly scattered by more massive objects (~13 Mearth) instead of colliding with them. Altogether, our results show that the probability of broadly matching the masses, mass ratio, and rotation periods of Uranus and Neptune in these two competing formation scenarios is broadly similar, within a factor of ~2, with overall probabilities of the order of ~0.1-1%.</description>

      <title>Exomoons of Circumbinary Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exomoon discovery is on the horizon. Although several exomoon candidates exist around single stars, there are currently no candidates around circumbinary planets (CBPs). Circumbinary planets are predicted to have migrated to their current location from a farther region of the protoplanetary disc where they formed. An exomoon of a CBP therefore represents a fascinating yet complex and evolving four-body system. Their existence (or absence) would shed light on the robustness of moon formation in more dynamically active planetary systems. In this work, we simulate exomoons around migrating CBPs. We show that for fully migrated CBPs a moon is capable of surviving the migration if it is formed within ~5-10% of the planet's Hill Radius. Roughly 30-40% of the surviving moons are in the habitable zone, giving credence to circumbinary habitability even if the known CBPs all gas giants. The majority of moons fall off of their host planet early in the migration and become long-period CBPs (i.e a multi-planet circumbinary system). A subset of exomoons are ejected from the system entirely. This last class presents a new mechanism for producing free-floating planetary mass objects, like those discovered recently and expected in the Roman microlensing survey.</description>

      <title>A dark, bare rock for TOI-1685 b from a JWST NIRSpec G395H phase curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of TOI-1685 b, a hot rocky super-Earth orbiting an M2.5V star, during a full orbit. We obtain transmission and emission spectra of the planet and characterize the properties of the phase curve, including its amplitude and offset. The transmission spectrum rules out clear H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98$\pm$0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823-5.172 um). Our results add to the growing number of seemingly airless M-star rocky planets, thus constraining the location of the "Cosmic Shoreline".
  Three independent data reductions have been carried out, all showing a high-amplitude correlated noise component in the white and spectroscopic light curves. The correlated noise properties are different between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors - importantly the timescales of the strongest components (4.5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively) - suggesting the noise is from instrumental rather than astrophysical origins. We encourage the community to look into the systematics of NIRSpec for long time-series observations.</description>

      <title>Transiting Jupiters around M-dwarfs have similar masses to FGK warm-Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets ($\gtrsim$ 8$R_{\oplus}$) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters ( $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_J$) around M-dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of $v$sin$i$ related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published non-detections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Drain: Despinning Embedded Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young and forming planetesimals experience impacts from particles present in a protostellar disk. Using crater scaling laws, we integrate ejecta distributions for oblique impacts. For impacts at 10 to 65 m/s, expected for impacts associated with a disk wind, we estimate the erosion rate and torque exerted on the planetesimal. We find that the mechanism for angular momentum drain proposed by Dobrovolskis and Burns (1984) for asteroids could operate in the low velocity regime of a disk wind. Though spin-down associated with impacts can facilitate planetesimal collapse, we find that the process is inefficient. We find that angular momentum drain via impacts operates in the gravitational focusing regime, though even less efficiently than for lower mass planetesimals. The angular momentum transfer is most effective when the wind speed is low, the projectile density is high compared to the bulk planetesimal density, and the planetesimal is composed of low-strength material. Due to its inefficiency, we find that angular momentum drain due to impacts within a pebble cloud does not by itself facilitate collapse of single planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Solar System Migration Points to a Renewed Concept: Galactic Habitable Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical evidence suggests that the Sun was born near 5 kpc from the Galactic center, within the corotation radius of the Galactic bar, around 6-7 kpc. This presents challenges for outward migration due to the Jacobi energy constraint, preventing stars from easily overcoming the corotation barrier. In this study, we use test particle simulations to explore two possible migration pathways for the Sun: a "trapped" scenario, where the Sun's orbit was influenced by a slowing Galactic bar, and an "untrapped" scenario driven by dynamic spiral arms. Our results demonstrate that both mechanisms can explain how the Sun migrated from its birth radius (approximately 5 kpc) to its current orbital radius around 8.5-9 kpc. Furthermore, we investigate the environmental changes experienced by the Sun along these migration pathways, focusing on variations in radiation hazards and comet fluxes, which may have impacted planetary habitability. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of galactic habitability, emphasizing that the path a star takes within the Milky Way can significantly affect its surrounding environment and the potential for life. We propose a new concept of "Galactic habitable orbits," which accounts for evolving galactic structures and their effects on stellar and planetary systems. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the solar system's migration and its implications for habitability within the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>An Image Simulator of Lunar Far-Side Impact Flashes Captured from the Earth-Moon L2 Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impact flashes on the moon are caused by high-speed collisions of celestial bodies with the lunar surface. The study of the impacts is critical for exploring the evolutionary history and formation of the Moon, and for quantifying the risk posed by the impacts to future human activity. Although the impacts have been monitored from the Earth by a few projects in past 20 years, the events occurring on the lunar far side have not been explored systematically so far. We here present an end-to-end image simulator dedicated to detecting and monitoring the impacts from space, which is useful for future mission design. The simulator is designed for modularity and developed in the Python environment, which is mainly composed of four components: the flash temporal radiation, the background emission, the telescope and the detector used to collect and measure the radiation. Briefly speaking, with a set of input parameters, the simulator calculates the flash radiation in the context of the spherical droplet model and the background emission from the lunar surface. The resulting images are then generated by the simulator after considering a series observational effects, including the stray light, transmission of the instrument, point spread function and multiple kinds of noise caused by a CCD/CMOS detector. The simulator is validated by comparing the calculation with the observations taken on the ground. The modular design enables the simulator to be improved and enhanced by including more complex physical models in the future, and to be flexible for other future space missions.</description>

      <title>Alternative solvents for life: framework for evaluation, current status and future research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Life is a complex, dynamic chemical system that requires a dense fluid solvent in which to take place. A common assumption is that the most likely solvent for life is liquid water, and some researchers argue that water is the only plausible solvent. However, a persistent theme in astrobiological research postulates that other liquids might be cosmically common, and could be solvents for the chemistry of life. In this paper we present a new framework for the analysis of candidate solvents for life, and deploy this framework to review substances that have been suggested as solvent candidates. We categorize each solvent candidate through four criteria: occurrence, solvation, solute stability and solvent chemical functionality. Our semi-quantitative approach addresses all the requirements for a solvent not only from the point of view of its chemical properties but also from the standpoint of their biochemical function. Only the protonating solvents fulfil all the chemical requirements to be a solvent for life, and of those only water and concentrated sulfuric acid are also likely to be abundant in a rocky planetary context. Among the non-protonating solvents liquid CO2 stands out as a planetary solvent, and its potential as a solvent for life should be explored. We conclude with a discussion of whether it is possible for a biochemistry to change solvents, as an adaptation to radical changes in a planet's environment. Our analysis provides the basis for prioritizing future experimental work exploring potential complex chemistry on other planets.</description>

      <title>Early-time small-scale structures in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the critical influence of small-scale flow structures (e.g., fronts, vortices, and waves) that immediately arise in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations initialized with a resting state. A hot, 1:1 spin-orbit synchronized Jupiter is used here as a clear example; but, the phenomenon is generic and important for any type of a hot synchronized planet -- gaseous, oceanic, or telluric. When the early-time structures are not captured in simulations (due to, e.g., poor resolution and/or too much dissipation), the flow behavior is markedly different at later times -- in an observationally significant way; for example, the flow at large-scale is smoother and much less dynamic. This results in the temperature field, and its corresponding thermal flux, to be incorrectly predicted in numerical simulations, even when the quantities are spatially averaged.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Sharp CO Snowline Transition in a Protoplanetary Disk and Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snowline, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to show that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8 arcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground-state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.</description>
