      <title>Exploring Relations among Fairness Notions in Discrete Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairly allocating indivisible items among agents is an important and well-studied problem. However, fairness does not have a single universally agreed-upon definition, and so, many different definitions of fairness have been proposed and studied. Some of these definitions are considered more fair than others, although stronger fairness notions are also more difficult to guarantee. In this work, we study 21 different notions of fairness and arrange them in a hierarchy. Formally, we say that a fairness notion $F_1$ implies another notion $F_2$ if every $F_1$-fair allocation is also an $F_2$-fair allocation. We give a near-complete picture of implications among fairness notions: for almost every pair of notions, we either prove that one notion implies the other, or we give a counterexample, i.e., an allocation that is fair by one notion but not by the other. Although some of these results are well-known, many of them are new. We give results for many different settings: allocating goods, allocating chores, and allocating mixed manna. We believe our work clarifies the relative merits of different fairness notions, and provides a foundation for further research in fair allocation. Moreover, we developed an inference engine to automate part of our work. This inference engine is implemented as a user-friendly web application and is not restricted to fair division scenarios, so it holds potential for broader use.</description>

      <title>Policy Abstraction and Nash Refinement in Tree-Exploiting PSRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) interleaves empirical game-theoretic analysis with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve games too complex for traditional analytic methods. Tree-exploiting PSRO (TE-PSRO) is a variant of this approach that iteratively builds a coarsened empirical game model in extensive form using data obtained from querying a simulator that represents a detailed description of the game. We make two main methodological advances to TE-PSRO that enhance its applicability to complex games of imperfect information. First, we introduce a scalable representation for the empirical game tree where edges correspond to implicit policies learned through DRL. These policies cover conditions in the underlying game abstracted in the game model, supporting sustainable growth of the tree over epochs. Second, we leverage extensive form in the empirical model by employing refined Nash equilibria to direct strategy exploration. To enable this, we give a modular and scalable algorithm based on generalized backward induction for computing a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) in an imperfect-information game. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a suite of games including an alternating-offer bargaining game with outside offers; our results demonstrate that TE-PSRO converges toward equilibrium faster when new strategies are generated based on SPE rather than Nash equilibrium, and with reasonable time/memory requirements for the growing empirical model.</description>

      <title>Coordination Mechanisms with Rank-Based Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical job-scheduling games, each job behaves as a selfish player, choosing a machine to minimize its own completion time. To reduce the equilibria inefficiency, coordination mechanisms~\cite{CKN04} are employed, allowing each machine to follow its own scheduling policy. In this paper we study the effects of incorporating {\em rank-based utilities} within coordination mechanisms across environments with either identical or unrelated machines.
  With rank-based utilities, players aim to perform well {\em relative to their competitors}, rather than solely minimizing their completion time. We first demonstrate that even in basic setups, such as two identical machines with unit-length jobs, a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) assignment may not exist. This observation motivates our inquiry into the complexity of determining whether a given game instance admits a NE. We prove that this problem is NP-complete, even in highly restricted cases. In contrast, we identify specific classes of games where a NE is guaranteed to exist, or where the decision problem can be resolved in polynomial time.
  Additionally, we examine how competition impacts the efficiency of Nash equilibria, or sink equilibria if a NE does not exist. We derive tight bounds on the price of anarchy, and show that competition may either enhance or degrade overall performance.</description>

      <title>Candidate nomination for Condorcet-consistent voting rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider elections where the set of candidates is partitioned into parties, and each party must nominate exactly one candidate. The Possible President problem asks whether some candidate of a given party can become the winner of the election for some nominations from other parties. We perform a multivariate computational complexity analysis of Possible President for a range of Condorcet-consistent voting rules, namely for Copeland$^\alpha$ for $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and Maximin. The parameters we study are the number of voters, the number of parties, and the maximum size of a party. For all voting rules under consideration, we obtain dichotomies based on the number of voters, classifying $\mathsf{NP}$-complete and polynomial-time solvable cases. Moreover, for each $\mathsf{NP}$-complete variant, we determine the parameterized complexity of every possible parameterization with the studied parameters as either (a) fixed-parameter tractable, (b) $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard but in $\mathsf{XP}$, or (c) $\mathsf{paraNP}$-hard, outlining the limits of tractability for these problems.</description>

      <title>Dominance Regions of Pursuit-evasion Games in Non-anticipative Information Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evader's dominance region is an important concept and the foundation of geometric methods for pursuit-evasion games. This article mainly reveals the relevant properties of the evader's dominance region, especially in non-anticipative information patterns. We can use these properties to research pursuit-evasion games in non-anticipative information patterns. The core problem is under what condition the pursuer has a non-anticipative strategy to prevent the evader leaving its initial dominance region before being captured regardless of the evader's strategy. We first define the evader's dominance region by the shortest path distance, and we rigorously prove for the first time that the initial dominance region of the evader is the reachable region of the evader in the open-loop sense. Subsequently, we prove that there exists a non-anticipative strategy by which the pursuer can capture the evader before the evader leaves its initial dominance region's closure in the absence of obstacles. For cases with obstacles, we provide a counter example to illustrate that such a non-anticipative strategy does not always exist, and provide a necessary condition for the existence of such strategy. Finally, we consider a scenario with a single corner obstacle and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of such a non-anticipative strategy. At the end of this article, we discuss the application of the evader's dominance region in target defense games. This article has important reference significance for the design of non-anticipative strategies in pursuit-evasion games with obstacles.</description>

      <title>A Complete Landscape of EFX Allocations on Graphs: Goods, Chores and Mixed Manna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study envy-free up to any item (EFX) allocations on simple graphs where vertices and edges represent agents and items respectively. An agent (vertex) is only interested in items (edges) that are incident to her and all other items always have zero marginal value to her. Christodoulou et al. [EC, 2023] first proposed this setting and studied the case of goods where every item has non-negative marginal values to every agent. In this work, we significantly generalize this setting and provide a complete set of results by considering the allocation of arbitrary items that can be goods, chores, or mixed manna under doubly monotone valuations with a mild assumption. For goods, we complement the results by Christodoulou et al. [EC, 2023] by considering another weaker notion of EFX in the literature and showing that an orientation -- a special allocation where each edge must be allocated to one of its endpoint agents -- that satisfies the weaker notion always exists and can be computed in polynomial time, contrary to the stronger notion for which an orientation may not exist and determining its existence is NP-complete. For chores, we show that an envy-free allocation always exists, and an EFX orientation may not exist but its existence can be determined in polynomial time. For mixed manna, we consider the four notions of EFX in the literature. We prove that an allocation that satisfies the strongest notion of EFX may not exist and determining its existence is NP-complete, while one that satisfies any of the other three notions always exists and can be computed in polynomial time. We also prove that an orientation that satisfies any of the four notions may not exist and determining its existence is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>The Battling Influencers Game: Nash Equilibria Structure of a Potential Game and Implications to Value Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When multiple influencers attempt to compete for a receiver's attention, their influencing strategies must account for the presence of one another. We introduce the Battling Influencers Game (BIG), a multi-player simultaneous-move general-sum game, to provide a game-theoretic characterization of this social phenomenon. We prove that BIG is a potential game, that it has either one or an infinite number of pure Nash equilibria (NEs), and these pure NEs can be found by convex optimization. Interestingly, we also prove that at any pure NE, all (except at most one) influencers must exaggerate their actions to the maximum extent. In other words, it is rational for the influencers to be non-truthful and extreme because they anticipate other influencers to cancel out part of their influence. We discuss the implications of BIG to value alignment.</description>

      <title>Ads in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal placement of advertisements for interactive platforms like conversational AI assistants. Importantly, conversations add a feature absent in canonical search markets -- time. The evolution of a conversation is informative about ad qualities, thus a platform could delay ad delivery to improve selection. However, delay endogenously shapes the supply of quality ads, possibly affecting revenue. We characterize the equilibria of first- and second-price auctions where the platform can commit to the auction format but not to its timing. We document sharp differences in the mechanisms' outcomes: first-price auctions are efficient but delay ad delivery, while second-price auctions avoid delay but allocate inefficiently. Revenue may be arbitrarily larger in a second-price auction than in a first-price auction. Optimal reserve prices alleviate these differences but flip the revenue ordering.</description>
