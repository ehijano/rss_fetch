      <title>Fully-Discretely Nonlinearly-Stable Flux Reconstruction Methods for Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully-discrete, nonlinearly-stable flux reconstruction (FD-NSFR) scheme is developed, which ensures robustness through entropy stability in both space and time for high-order flux reconstruction schemes. We extend the entropy-stable flux reconstruction semidiscretization of Cicchino et al. [1,2,3] with the relaxation Runge Kutta method to construct the FD-NSFR scheme. We focus our study on entropy-stable flux reconstruction methods, which allow a larger time step size than discontinuous Galerkin. In this work, we develop an FD-NSFR scheme that prevents temporal numerical entropy change in the broken Sobolev norm if the governing equations admit a convex entropy function that can be expressed in inner-product form. For governing equations with a general convex numerical entropy function, temporal entropy change in the physical $L_2$ norm is prevented. As a result, for general convex numerical entropy, the FD-NSFR scheme achieves fully-discrete entropy stability only when the DG correction function is employed. We use entropy-conserving and entropy-stable test cases for the Burgers', Euler, and Navier-Stokes equations to demonstrate that the FD-NSFR scheme prevents temporal numerical entropy change. The FD-NSFR scheme therefore allows for a larger time step size while maintaining the robustness offered by entropy-stable schemes. We find that the FD-NSFR scheme is able to recover both integrated quantities and solution contours at a higher target time-step size than the semi-discretely entropy-stable scheme, suggesting a robustness advantage for low-Mach turbulence simulations.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Steady-State Approach for Efficient Multiscale Simulation and Optimization of mAb Glycosylation in CHO Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for monoclonal antibody, and multiscale mechanistic models, spanning from the bioreactor to the Golgi apparatus, have been proposed for analyzing the glycosylation process. However, these models are computationally intensive to solve, making optimization and control challenging. In this work, we propose a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach for efficiently solving the multiscale glycosylation model. By introducing the QSS assumption and assuming negligible nucleotide sugar donor flux for glycosylation in the Golgi, the large-scale partial differential algebraic equation system is converted into a series of independent differential algebraic equation systems. Based on that representation, we develop a three-step QSS simulation method and further reduce computational time through parallel computing and nonuniform time grid strategies. Case studies in simulation, parameter estimation, and dynamic optimization demonstrate that the QSS approach can be more than 300-fold faster than the method of lines, with less than 1.6% relative errors.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Systems of Non-interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our focus is on simulating the dynamics of non-interacting particles, which, under certain assumptions, can be formally described by the Dean-Kawasaki equation. The Dean-Kawasaki equation can be solved numerically using standard finite volume methods. However, the numerical approximation implicitly requires a sufficiently large number of particles to ensure the positivity of the solution and accurate approximation of the stochastic flux. To address this challenge, we extend hybrid algorithms for particle systems to scenarios where the density is low. The aim is to create a hybrid algorithm that switches from a finite volume discretization to a particle-based method when the particle density falls below a certain threshold. We develop criteria for determining this threshold by comparing higher-order statistics obtained from the finite volume method with particle simulations. We then demonstrate the use of the resulting criteria for dynamic adaptation in both two- and three-dimensional spatial settings.</description>

      <title>A parameter uniform hybrid approach for singularly perturbed two-parameter parabolic problem with discontinuous data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we address singularly perturbed two-parameter parabolic problem of the reaction-convection-diffusion type in two dimensions. These problems exhibit discontinuities in the source term and convection coefficient at particular domain points, which result in the formation of interior layers. The presence of two perturbation parameters leads to the formation of boundary layers with varying widths. Our primary focus is to address these layers and develop a scheme that is uniformly convergent. So we propose a hybrid monotone difference scheme for the spatial direction, implemented on a specially designed piece-wise uniform Shishkin mesh, combined with the Crank-Nicolson method on a uniform mesh for the temporal direction. The resulting scheme is proven to be uniformly convergent, with an order of almost two in the spatial direction and exactly two in the temporal direction. Numerical experiments support the theoretically proven higher order of convergence and shows that our approach results in better accuracy and convergence compared to other existing methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>New $C^0$ interior penalty method for Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation is a prototype second-order fully nonlinear partial differential equation. In this paper, we propose a new idea to design and analyze the $C^0$ interior penalty method to approximation the viscosity solution of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation. The new methods is inspired from the discrete Miranda-Talenti estimate. Based on the vanishing moment representation, we approximate the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation by the fourth order semi-linear equation with some additional boundary conditions. We will use the discrete Miranda-Talenti estimates to ensure the well-posedness of the numerical scheme and derive the error estimates.</description>

      <title>Randomized methods for computing joint eigenvalues, with applications to multiparameter eigenvalue problems and root finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a family of $n\times n$ commuting matrices can be simultaneously triangularized by a unitary similarity transformation. The diagonal entries of the triangular matrices define the $n$ joint eigenvalues of the family. In this work, we consider the task of numerically computing approximations to such joint eigenvalues for a family of (nearly) commuting matrices. This task arises, for example, in solvers for multiparameter eigenvalue problems and systems of multivariate polynomials, which are our main motivations. We propose and analyze a simple approach that computes eigenvalues as one-sided or two-sided Rayleigh quotients from eigenvectors of a random linear combination of the matrices in the family. We provide some analysis and numerous numerical examples, showing that such randomized approaches can compute semisimple joint eigenvalues accurately and lead to improved performance of existing solvers.</description>

      <title>An extended Milstein scheme for effective weak approximation of diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and effective method for discretizing multi-dimensional diffusion processes as an extension of Milstein scheme. The new scheme is explicitly given and can be simulated using Gaussian variates, requiring the same number of random variables as Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme. We show that the proposed scheme has a weak convergence rate of one, which is consistent with other classical schemes like EM/Milstein schemes but involves fewer leading-order error terms. Due to the reduction of the error terms, the proposed scheme is expected to provide a more accurate estimation than alternative first-order schemes. We demonstrate that the weak error of the new scheme is effectively reduced compared with EM/Milstein schemes when the diffusion coefficients involve a small parameter. We conduct simulation studies on Asian option pricing in finance to showcase that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms EM/Milstein schemes, while interestingly, we find no differences in the performance between EM and Milstein schemes.</description>

      <title>A Priori Error Bounds for POD-ROMs for Fluids: A Brief Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galerkin reduced order models (ROMs), e.g., based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) or reduced basis methods, have achieved significant success in the numerical simulation of fluid flows. The ROM numerical analysis, however, is still being developed. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and present a survey of a priori error bounds, with a particular focus on POD-based ROMs. Specifically, we outline the main components of ROM a priori error bounds, emphasize their practical importance, and discuss significant contributions to a priori error bounds for ROMs for fluids.</description>

      <title>A modified FC-Gram approximation algorithm with provable error bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FC-Gram trigonometric polynomial approximation of a non-periodic function that interpolates the function on equispaced grids was introduced in 2010 by Bruno and Lyon [J. Comput. Phys, 229(6):2009-2033, 2010]. Since then, the approximation algorithm and its further refinements have been used extensively in numerical solutions of various PDE-based problems, and it has had impressive success in handling challenging configurations. While much computational evidence exists in the literature confirming the rapid convergence of FC-Gram approximations, a theoretical convergence analysis has remained open. In this paper, we study a modified FC-Gram algorithm where the implicit least-squares-based periodic extensions of the Gram polynomials are replaced with an explicit extension utilizing two-point Hermite polynomials. This modification brings in two significant advantages - (i) as the extensions are known explicitly, the need to use computationally expensive precomputed extension data is eliminated, which, in turn, facilitates seamlessly changing the extension length, and (ii) allows for establishing provable error bounds for the modified approximations. We show that the numerical convergence rates are consistent with those predicted by the theory through a variety of computational experiments.</description>

      <title>The TRUNC element in any dimension and application to a modified Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel TRUNC finite element in n dimensions, encompassing the traditional TRUNC triangle as a particular instance. By establishing the weak continuity identity, we identify it as crucial for error estimate. This element is utilized to approximate a modified Poisson equation defined on a convex polytope, originating from the nonlocal electrostatics model. We have substantiated a uniform error estimate and conducted numerical tests on both the smooth solution and the solution with a sharp boundary layer, which align with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parallel orbital-updating approach is an orbital iteration based approach for solving eigenvalue problems when many eigenpairs are required, and has been proven to be very efficient, for instance, in electronic structure calculations. In this paper, based on the investigation of a quasi-orthogonality, we present the numerical analysis of the parallel orbital-updating approach for linear eigenvalue problems, including convergence and error estimates of the numerical approximations.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable, high-order finite-difference operators on point clouds over complex geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order difference operators with the summation-by-parts (SBP) property can be used to build stable discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws; however, most high-order SBP operators require a conforming, high-order mesh for the domain of interest. To circumvent this requirement, we present an algorithm for building high-order, diagonal-norm, first-derivative SBP operators on point clouds over complex geometries. The algorithm is not mesh-free, since it uses a Cartesian cut-cell mesh to define the sparsity pattern of the operators and to provide intermediate quadrature rules; however, the mesh is generated automatically and can be discarded once the SBP operators have been constructed. Using this temporary mesh, we construct local, cell-based SBP difference operators that are assembled into global SBP operators. We identify conditions for the existence of a positive-definite diagonal mass matrix, and we compute the diagonal norm by solving a sparse system of linear inequalities using an interior-point algorithm. We also describe an artificial dissipation operator that complements the first-derivative operators when solving hyperbolic problems, although the dissipation is not required for stability. The numerical results confirm the conditions under which a diagonal norm exists and study the distribution of the norm's entries. In addition, the results verify the accuracy and stability of the point-cloud SBP operators using the linear advection equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $hp$-discontinuous Galerkin (DG) time-stepping method for the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation with memory, a non-linear advection-diffusion-reaction problem featuring weakly singular kernels. We derive a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete scheme using $hp$-DG time-stepping, with explicit dependence on the local mesh size, polynomial degree, and solution regularity, achieving optimal convergence in the energy norm. For the fully-discrete scheme, we initially implement the $hp$-finite element method (conforming), followed by the $hp$-discontinuous Galerkin method. We establish the well-posedness and stability of the fully-discrete scheme and provide corresponding a priori estimates. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical validation on a series of test problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decomposition-Based Algorithms for $\ell_1$-Regularized Inverse Problems with Column-Orthogonal and Kronecker Product Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problem where both the forward and regularization operators have a Kronecker product structure. By leveraging this structure, a joint decomposition can be obtained using generalized singular value decompositions. We show how this joint decomposition can be effectively integrated into the Split Bregman and Majorization-Minimization methods to solve the $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problem. Furthermore, for cases involving column-orthogonal regularization matrices, we prove that the joint decomposition can be derived directly from the singular value decomposition of the system matrix. As a result, we show that framelet and wavelet operators are efficient for these decomposition-based algorithms in the context of $\ell_1$-regularized image deblurring problems.</description>

      <title>Time-fractional diffusion equations with randomness, and efficient numerical estimations of expected values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a time-fractional diffusion equation of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$ with a stochastic diffusivity parameter. We focus on efficient estimation of the expected values (considered as an infinite dimensional integral on the parametric space corresponding to the random coefficients) of linear functionals acting on the solution of our model problem. To estimate the expected value computationally, the infinite expansions of the random parameter need to be truncated. Then we approximate the high-dimensional integral over the random field using a high-order quasi-Monte Carlo method. This follows by approximating the deterministic solution over the space-time domain via a second-order accurate time-stepping scheme in combination with a spatial discretization by Galerkin finite elements. Under reasonable regularity assumptions on the given data, we show some regularity properties of the continuous solution and investigate the errors from estimating the expected value. We report on numerical experiments that complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A potential energy conserving finite element method for turbulent variable density flow: application to glacier-fjord circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a continuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations, suitable for various applications such as coastal ocean dynamics and ice-ocean interactions, among others. In particular, we introduce a consistent modification of the gravity force term which enhances conservation properties for Galerkin methods without strictly enforcing the divergence-free condition. We show that this modification results in a sharp energy estimate, including both kinetic and potential energy. Additionally, we propose a new, symmetric, tensor-based viscosity operator that is especially suitable for modeling turbulence in stratified flow. The viscosity coefficients are constructed using a residual-based shock-capturing method and the method conserves angular momentum and dissipates kinetic energy. We validate our proposed method through numerical tests and use it to model the ocean circulation and basal melting beneath the ice tongue of the Ryder Glacier and the adjacent Sherard Osborn fjord in two dimensions on a fully unstructured mesh. Our results compare favorably with a standard numerical ocean model, showing better resolved turbulent flow features and reduced artificial diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the design of a checkerboard air-gas heat exchanger suitable for industrial applications. The design of the heat exchanger is optimized in order to obtain the maximum increase of the outlet air temperature, considering different geometrical design parameters and including manufacturing constraints. The heat exchanger efficiency has been assessed by means of the $\epsilon$-NTU method. The perfomances are compared with traditional finned recuperators and appreciable enhancement of the exchanger efficiency has been observed adopting the new design.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear magnetic field solvers using local Quasi-Newton updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-point or Newton-methods are typically employed for the numerical solution of nonlinear systems arising from discretization of nonlinear magnetic field problems. We here discuss an alternative strategy which uses local Quasi-Newton updates to construct appropriate linearizations of the material behavior during the nonlinear iteration. The resulting scheme shows similar fast convergence as the Newton-method but, like the fixed-point methods, does not require derivative information of the underlying material law. As a consequence, the method can be used for the efficient solution of models with hysteresis which involve nonsmooth material behavior. The implementation of the proposed scheme can be realized in standard finite-element codes in parallel to the fixed-point and the Newton method. A full convergence analysis of all three methods is established proving global mesh-independent convergence. The theoretical results and the performance of the nonlinear iterative schemes are evaluated by computational tests for a typical benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schwarz methods to compute geodesics on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the leapfrog algorithm by Noakes for computing geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. The main idea behind this algorithm is to subdivide the original endpoint geodesic problem into several local problems, for which the endpoint geodesic problem can be solved more easily by any local method (e.g., the single shooting method). The algorithm then iteratively updates a piecewise geodesic to obtain a global geodesic between the original endpoints. From a domain decomposition perspective, we show that the leapfrog algorithm can be viewed as a classical Schwarz alternating method. Thanks to this analogy, we use techniques from nonlinear preconditioning to improve the convergence properties of the method. Preliminary numerical experiments suggest that this is a promising approach.</description>

      <title>Variable reduction as a nonlinear preconditioning approach for optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When considering an unconstrained minimization problem, a standard approach is to solve the optimality system with a Newton method possibly preconditioned by, e.g., nonlinear elimination. In this contribution, we argue that nonlinear elimination could be used to reduce the number of optimization variables by artificially constraining them to satisfy a subset of the optimality conditions. Consequently, a reduced objective function is derived which can now be minimized with any optimization algorithm. By choosing suitable variables to eliminate, the conditioning of the reduced optimization problem is largely improved. We here focus in particular on a right preconditioned gradient descent and show theoretical and numerical results supporting the validity of the presented approach.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order compact finite difference schemes for solving biharmonic equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a genuine fourth-order compact finite difference scheme for solving biharmonic equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in both two and three dimensions. In the 2D case, we build upon the high-order compact (HOC) schemes for flux-type boundary conditions originally developed by Zhilin Li and Kejia Pan [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 45 (2023), pp. A646-A674] to construct a high order compact discretization for coupled boundary conditions. When considering the 3D case, we modify carefully designed undetermined coefficient methods of Li and Pan to derive the finite difference approximations of coupled boundary conditions. The resultant FD discretization maintains the global fourth order convergence and compactness. Unlike the very popular Stephenson method, the number of unknows do not increase with dimensions. Besides, it is noteworthy that the condition number of the coefficient matrix increases at a rate of $O(h^{-2})$ in both 2D and 3D. We also validate the performance of the proposed genuine HOC methods through nontrivial examples.</description>

      <title>Nested Bregman Iterations for Decomposition Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of image reconstruction while simultaneously decomposing the reconstructed image into components with different features. A commonly used tool for this is a variational approach with an infimal convolution of appropriate functions as a regularizer. Especially for noise corrupted observations, incorporating these functionals into the classical method of Bregman iterations provides a robust method for obtaining an overall good approximation of the true image, by stopping early the iteration according to a discrepancy principle. However, crucially, the quality of the separate components depends further on the proper choice of the regularization weights associated to the infimally convoluted functionals. Here, we propose the method of Nested Bregman iterations to improve a decomposition in a structured way. This allows to transform the task of choosing the weights into the problem of stopping the iteration according to a meaningful criterion based on normalized cross-correlation. We discuss the well-definedness and the convergence behavior of the proposed method, and illustrate its strength numerically with various image decomposition tasks employing infimal convolution functionals.</description>

      <title>IMEX-RK finite volume methods for nonlinear 1d parabolic PDEs. Application to option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop 2nd order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) finite volume (FV) schemes for solving 1d parabolic PDEs for option pricing, with possible nonlinearities in the source and advection terms. The spatial semi-discretization of the advection is carried out by combining finite volume methods with 2nd order state reconstructions; while the diffusive terms are discretized using second-order finite differences. The time integration is performed by means of IMEX-RK time integrators: the advection is treated explicitly, and the diffusion, implicitly. The obtained numerical schemes have several advantages: they are computationally very efficient, thanks to the implicit discretization of the diffusion in the IMEX-RK time integrators, which allows to overcome the strict time step restriction; they yield second-order accuracy for even nonlinear problems and with non-regular initial conditions; and they can be extended to higher order.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel and general methodology for building second-order finite volume implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta numerical schemes for solving two-dimensional financial parabolic PDEs with mixed derivatives. The methods achieve second-order convergence even in the presence of non-regular initial conditions. The IMEX time integrator allows to overcome the tiny time-step induced by the diffusive term in the explicit schemes, also providing accurate and non-oscillatory approximations of the Greeks.</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacians on the hyperbolic space -- a compared study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main motivation behind this paper stems from a notable gap in the existing literature: the absence of a discrete counterpart to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifolds, which can be effectively used to solve PDEs. We consider that the natural approach to pioneer this field is to first explore one of the simplest non-trivial (i.e., non-Euclidean) scenario, specifically focusing on the $2$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^2$. To this end, we present two variants of discrete finite-difference operator tailored to this constant negatively curved space, both serving as approximations to the (continuous) Laplace-Beltrami operator within the $\mathrm{L}^2$ framework. Moreover, we prove that the discrete heat equation associated to both aforesaid operators exhibits stability and converges towards the continuous heat-Beltrami Cauchy problem on $\mathbb{H}^2$. Eventually, we illustrate that a discrete Laplacian specifically designed for the geometry of the hyperbolic space yields a more precise approximation and offers advantages from both theoretical and computational perspectives.</description>

      <title>A deep learning-based surrogate model for seismic data assimilation in fault activation modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the safety and environmental impacts of subsurface resource exploitation and management is critical and requires robust geomechanical modeling. However, uncertainties stemming from model assumptions, intrinsic variability of governing parameters, and data errors challenge the reliability of predictions. In the absence of direct measurements, inverse modeling and stochastic data assimilation methods can offer reliable solutions, but in complex and large-scale settings, the computational expense can become prohibitive.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep learning-based surrogate model (SurMoDeL) designed for seismic data assimilation in fault activation modeling. The surrogate model leverages neural networks to provide simplified yet accurate representations of complex geophysical systems, enabling faster simulations and analyses essential for uncertainty quantification. The work proposes two different methods to integrate an understanding of fault behavior into the model, thereby enhancing the accuracy of its predictions. The application of the proxy model to integrate seismic data through effective data assimilation techniques efficiently constrains the uncertain parameters, thus bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world observations.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition-based coupling of Operator Inference reduced order models via the Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01433v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an approach for coupling together subdomain-local reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) with each other and with subdomain-local full order models (FOMs), following a domain decomposition of the spatial geometry on which a given partial differential equation (PDE) is posed. Joining subdomain-local models is accomplished using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method, a minimally-intrusive multiscale coupling technique that works by transforming a monolithic problem into a sequence of subdomain-local problems, which communicate through transmission boundary conditions imposed on the subdomain interfaces. After formulating the overlapping Schwarz alternating method for OpInf ROMs, termed OpInf-Schwarz, we evaluate the method's accuracy and efficiency on several test cases involving the heat equation in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate that the method is capable of coupling together arbitrary combinations of OpInf ROMs and FOMs, and that speed-ups over a monolithic FOM are possible when performing OpInf ROM coupling.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the pseudospectral approximation of reproduction numbers for age-structured models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously investigate the convergence of a new numerical method, recently proposed by the authors, to approximate the reproduction numbers of a large class of age-structured population models with finite age span. The method consists in reformulating the problem on a space of absolutely continuous functions via an integral mapping. For any chosen splitting into birth and transition processes, we first define an operator that maps a generation to the next one (corresponding to the Next Generation Operator in the case of R0). Then, we approximate the infinite-dimensional operator with a matrix using pseudospectral discretization. In this paper, we prove that the spectral radius of the resulting matrix converges to the true reproduction number, and the (interpolation of the) corresponding eigenvector converges to the associated eigenfunction, with convergence order that depends on the regularity of the model coefficients. Results are confirmed experimentally and applications to epidemiology are discussed.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Noise-Free Sampling Algorithms with Regularized Wasserstein Proximals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the convergence properties of the backward regularized Wasserstein proximal (BRWP) method for sampling a target distribution. The BRWP approach can be shown as a semi-implicit time discretization for a probability flow ODE with the score function whose density satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. Specifically, the evolution of the score function is computed using a kernel formula derived from the regularized Wasserstein proximal operator. By applying the Laplace method to obtain the asymptotic expansion of this kernel formula, we establish guaranteed convergence in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the BRWP method towards a strongly log-concave target distribution. Our analysis also identifies the optimal and maximum step sizes for convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deterministic and semi-implicit BRWP scheme outperforms many classical Langevin Monte Carlo methods, such as the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA), by offering faster convergence and reduced bias. Numerical experiments further validate the convergence analysis of the BRWP method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Compactly Supported Functions in Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs unique compactly supported functions in Sobolev spaces that have minimal norm, maximal support, and maximal central value, under certain renormalizations. They may serve as optimized basis functions in interpolation or approximation, or as shape functions in meshless methods for PDE solving. Their norm is useful for proving upper bounds for convergence rates of interpolation in Sobolev spaces $H_2^m(\R^d)$, and this paper gives the correct rate $m-d/2$ that arises as convergence like $h^{m-d/2}$ for interpolation at meshwidth $h\to 0$ or a blow-up like $r^{-(m-d/2)}$ for norms of compactly supported functions with support radius $r\to 0$. In Hilbert spaces with infinitely smooth reproducing kernels, like Gaussians or inverse multiquadrics, there are no compactly supported functions at all, but in spaces with limited smoothness, compactly supported functions exist and can be optimized in the above way. The construction is described in Hilbert space via projections, and analytically via trace operators. Numerical examples are provided.</description>

Abstract: Consider a non-linear operator equation $x - K(x) = f$, where $f$ is given and $K$ is a Urysohn integral operator with Green's function type kernel defined on $L^\infty [0, 1]$. We apply methods of approximation based on interpolatory projections (where interpolation points are not necessarily Gauss points) and get solutions with higher accuracy than the collocation solution of the above equation.

Abstract: A nonlinear generalisation of the PageRank problem involving the Moore-Penrose inverse of the incidence matrix is developed for local graph partitioning purposes. The Levenberg-Marquardt method with a full rank Jacobian variant provides a strategy for obtaining a numerical solution to the generalised problem. Sets of vertices are formed according to the ranking supplied by the solution, and a conductance criterion decides upon the set that best represents the cluster around a starting vertex. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world inspired graphs demonstrate the capability of the approach to not only produce low conductance sets, but to also recover local clusters with an accuracy that consistently surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Gauss-Seidel Method with a Preconditioned Fixed-Point Iteration for the Steady-State Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical solver for the steady-state Boltzmann equation based on the symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SGS) method. To solve the nonlinear system on each grid cell derived from the SGS method, a fixed-point iteration preconditioned with its asymptotic limit is developed. The preconditioner only requires solving an algebraic system which is easy to implement and can speed up the convergence significantly especially in the case of small Knudsen numbers. Additionally, we couple our numerical scheme with the multigrid method to accelerate convergence. A variety of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of these methods.</description>

      <title>ELM-FBPINN: efficient finite-basis physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer several advantages when compared to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs, such as being a mesh-free approach and being easily extendable to solving inverse problems. One promising approach for allowing PINNs to scale to multi-scale problems is to combine them with domain decomposition; for example, finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) replace the global PINN network with many localised networks which are summed together to approximate the solution. In this work, we significantly accelerate the training of FBPINNs by linearising their underlying optimisation problem. We achieve this by employing extreme learning machines (ELMs) as their subdomain networks and showing that this turns the FBPINN optimisation problem into one of solving a linear system or least-squares problem. We test our workflow in a preliminary fashion by using it to solve an illustrative 1D problem.</description>

      <title>Joint Approximate Partial Diagonalization of Large Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of $p$ symmetric (real) matrices, the Orthogonal Joint Diagonalization (OJD) problem consists of finding an orthonormal basis in which the representation of each of these $p$ matrices is as close as possible to a diagonal matrix. We argue that when the matrices are of large dimension, then the natural generalization of this problem is to seek an orthonormal basis of a certain subspace that is a near eigenspace for all the matrices in the set. We refer to this as the problem of ``partial joint diagonalization of matrices.'' The approach proposed first finds this approximate common near eigenspace and then proceeds to a joint diagonalization of the restrictions of the input matrices in this subspace. A few solution methods for this problem are proposed and illustrations of its potential applications are provided.</description>

      <title>Very high-order symmetric positive-interior quadrature rules on triangles and tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel fully-symmetric quadrature rules with positive weights and strictly interior nodes of degrees up to 84 on triangles and 40 on tetrahedra. Initial guesses for solving the nonlinear systems of equations needed to derive quadrature rules are generated by forming tensor-product structures on quadrilateral/hexahedral subdomains of the simplices using the Legendre-Gauss nodes on the first half of the line reference element. In combination with a methodology for node elimination, these initial guesses lead to the development of highly efficient quadrature rules, even for very high polynomial degrees. Using existing estimates of the minimum number of quadrature points for a given degree, we show that the derived quadrature rules on triangles and tetrahedra are more than 95% and 80% efficient, respectively, for almost all degrees. The accuracy of the quadrature rules is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Analysis of nonlocal smart beams following fractional-order constitutive relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a fractional-calculus based constitutive model for capturing nonlocal interactions over the multiphysics response in solids. More specifically, we develop constitutive relations for nonlocal piezoelectricity incorporating fractional-order kinematic relations to capture the long-range interactions over electrical and mechanical field variables. This study breaks new ground by developing fractional-order constitutive models for a two-way multiphysics (electro-mechanical) coupling, specifically the direct and converse piezoelectric effect. It is expected that long-range interactions over each field variable (elastic and electrical) can be leveraged to develop metastructures with enhanced multiphysics coupling. To better illustrate this, we choose the example of a smart beam composed of a nonlocal substrate and a piezoelectric layer. We establish the analytical and numerical framework to analyze nonlocal smart beams based on variational principles. The fractional-Finite Element (f-FE) numerical solver, facilitating multiphysics coupling, undergoes comprehensive validation through multiple case studies. Finally, detailed studies point towards tuning the multiphysics coupling possible via nonlocal interactions across the domain.</description>

      <title>Methods based on Radon transform for non-affine deformable image registration of noisy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a standard engineering problem used to determine the distortion experienced by a body by comparing two images of it in different states. This study introduces two new DIR methods designed to capture non-affine deformations using Radon transform-based similarity measures and a classical regularizer based on linear elastic deformation energy. It establishes conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions for both methods and presents synthetic experimental results comparing them with a standard method based on the sum of squared differences similarity measure. These methods have been tested to capture various non-affine deformations in images, both with and without noise, and their convergence rates have been analyzed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these methods was also evaluated in a lung image registration scenario.</description>

      <title>A fast solver for the spatially homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the velocity-space, spatially homogeneous, collisional Boltzmann equation for electron transport in low-temperature plasma (LTP) conditions. Modeling LTP plasmas is useful in many applications, including advanced manufacturing, material processing, semiconductor processing, and hypersonics, to name a few. Most state-of-the-art methods for electron kinetics are based on Monte-Carlo sampling for collisions combined with Lagrangian particle-in-cell methods. We discuss an Eulerian solver that approximates the electron velocity distribution function using spherical harmonics (angular components) and B-splines (energy component). Our solver supports electron-heavy elastic and inelastic binary collisions, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, steady-state and transient dynamics, and an arbitrary nmber of angular terms in the electron distribution function. We report convergence results and compare our solver to two other codes: an in-house particle Monte-Carlo ethod; and Bolsig+, a state-of-the-art Eulerian solver for electron transport in LTPs. Furthermore, we use our solver to study the relaxation time scales of the higher-order anisotropic correction terms. Our code is open-source and provides an interface that allows coupling to multiphysics simulations of low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generalized bathtub model, a nonlocal transport equation for describing network trip flows served by privately operated vehicles inside a road network. First, we establish the well-posedness of the mathematical model for both classical and weak solutions. Then we consider an inverse source problem of the model with model parameters embodying particular traffic situations. We establish a conditional Lipschitz stability of the inverse problem under suitable a priori regularity assumption on the problem data, using a Volterra integral formulation of the problem. Inspired by the analysis, we develop an easy-to-implement numerical method for reconstructing the flow rates, and provide the error analysis of the method. Further we present several numerical experiments to complement the theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: We study the universal approximation properties of transformers and neural integral operators for operators in Banach spaces. In particular, we show that the transformer architecture is a universal approximator of integral operators between H\"older spaces. Moreover, we show that a generalized version of neural integral operators, based on the Gavurin integral, are universal approximators of arbitrary operators between Banach spaces. Lastly, we show that a modified version of transformer, which uses Leray-Schauder mappings, is a universal approximator of operators between arbitrary Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>On the optimal approximation of Sobolev and Besov functions using deep ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of how efficiently functions in the Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{W}^{s,q}([0,1]^d)$ and Besov spaces $\mathcal{B}^s_{q,r}([0,1]^d)$ can be approximated by deep ReLU neural networks with width $W$ and depth $L$, when the error is measured in the $L^p([0,1]^d)$ norm. This problem has been studied by several recent works, which obtained the approximation rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s/d})$ up to logarithmic factors when $p=q=\infty$, and the rate $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2s/d})$ for networks with fixed width when the Sobolev embedding condition $1/q -1/p&lt;s/d$ holds. We generalize these results by showing that the rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s/d})$ indeed holds under the Sobolev embedding condition. It is known that this rate is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The key tool in our proof is a novel encoding of sparse vectors by using deep ReLU neural networks with varied width and depth, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness, long-time behavior, and discretization of some models of nonlinear acoustics in velocity-enthalpy formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of models for nonlinear acoustics, including the well-known Westervelt and Kuznetsov equations, as well as a model of Rasmussen that can be seen as a thermodynamically consistent modification of the latter. Using linearization, energy estimates, and fixed-point arguments, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions that, for sufficiently small data, are global in time and converge exponentially fast to equilibrium. In contrast to previous work, our analysis is based on a velocity-enthalpy formulation of the problem, whose weak form reveals the underlying port-Hamiltonian structure. Moreover, the weak form of the problem is particularly well-suited for a structure-preserving discretization. This is demonstrated in numerical tests, which also highlight typical characteristics of the models under consideration.</description>

      <title>Exponential polynomials and identification of polygonal regions from Fourier samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the set $E(D, N)$ of all bivariate exponential polynomials $$ f(\xi, \eta) = \sum_{j=1}^n p_j(\xi, \eta) e^{2\pi i (x_j\xi+y_j\eta)}, $$ where the polynomials $p_j \in \mathbb{C}[\xi, \eta]$ have degree $&lt;D$, $n\le N$ and where $x_j, y_j \in \mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. We find a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ that depends on $N$ and $D$ only and is of size $O(D^2 N \log N)$ such that the values of $f$ on $A$ determine $f$. Notice that the size of $A$ is only larger by a logarithmic quantity than the number of parameters needed to write down $f$.
  We use this in order to prove some uniqueness results about polygonal regions given a small set of samples of the Fourier Transform of their indicator function. If the number of different slopes of the edges of the polygonal region is $\le k$ then the region is determined from a predetermined set of Fourier samples that depends only on $k$ and the maximum number of vertices $N$ and is of size $O(k^2 N \log N)$. In the particular case where all edges are known to be parallel to the axes the polygonal region is determined from a set of $O(N \log N)$ Fourier samples that depends on $N$ only.
  Our methods are non-constructive.</description>

      <title>Stein transport for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Stein transport}$, a novel methodology for Bayesian inference designed to efficiently push an ensemble of particles along a predefined curve of tempered probability distributions. The driving vector field is chosen from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and can be derived either through a suitable kernel ridge regression formulation or as an infinitesimal optimal transport map in the Stein geometry. The update equations of Stein transport resemble those of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), but introduce a time-varying score function as well as specific weights attached to the particles. While SVGD relies on convergence in the long-time limit, Stein transport reaches its posterior approximation at finite time $t=1$. Studying the mean-field limit, we discuss the errors incurred by regularisation and finite-particle effects, and we connect Stein transport to birth-death dynamics and Fisher-Rao gradient flows. In a series of experiments, we show that in comparison to SVGD, Stein transport not only often reaches more accurate posterior approximations with a significantly reduced computational budget, but that it also effectively mitigates the variance collapse phenomenon commonly observed in SVGD.</description>

      <title>Causality-guided adaptive sampling method for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to purely data-driven methods, a key feature of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) - a proven powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) - is the embedding of PDE constraints into the loss function. The selection and distribution of collocation points for evaluating PDE residuals are critical to the performance of PINNs. Furthermore, the causal training is currently a popular training mode. In this work, we propose the causality-guided adaptive sampling (Causal AS) method for PINNs. Given the characteristics of causal training, we use the weighted PDE residuals as the indicator for the selection of collocation points to focus on areas with larger PDE residuals within the regions being trained. For the hyper-parameter $p$ involved, we develop the temporal alignment driven update (TADU) scheme for its dynamic update beyond simply fixing it as a constant. The collocation points selected at each time will be released before the next adaptive sampling step to avoid the cumulative effects caused by previously chosen collocation points and reduce computational costs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the Causal AS method, we apply it to solve time-dependent equations, including the Allen-Cahn equation, the NLS equation, the KdV equation and the mKdV equation. During the training process, we employe a time-marching technique and strictly impose the periodic boundary conditions by embedding the input coordinates into Fourier expansion to mitigate optimization challenges. Numerical results indicate that the predicted solution achieves an excellent agreement with the ground truth. Compared to a similar work, the causal extension of R3 sampling (Causal R3), our proposed Causal AS method demonstrates a significant advantage in accuracy.</description>

      <title>A novel and efficient parameter estimation of the Lognormal-Rician turbulence model based on k-Nearest Neighbor and data generation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient parameter estimator based on $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) and data generation method for the Lognormal-Rician turbulence channel. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit statistical tools are employed to investigate the validity of $k$NN approximation under different channel conditions and it is shown that the choice of $k$ plays a significant role in the approximation accuracy. We present several numerical results to illustrate that solving the constructed objective function can provide a reasonable estimate for the actual values. The accuracy of the proposed estimator is investigated in terms of the mean square error. The simulation results show that increasing the number of generation samples by two orders of magnitude does not lead to a significant improvement in estimation performance when solving the optimization problem by the gradient descent algorithm. However, the estimation performance under the genetic algorithm (GA) approximates to that of the saddlepoint approximation and expectation-maximization estimators. Therefore, combined with the GA, we demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves the best tradeoff between the computation complexity and the accuracy.</description>

      <title>PINNIES: An Efficient Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework to Integral Operator Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient tensor-vector product technique for the rapid and accurate approximation of integral operators within physics-informed deep learning frameworks. Our approach leverages neural network architectures to evaluate problem dynamics at specific points, while employing Gaussian quadrature formulas to approximate the integral components, even in the presence of infinite domains or singularities. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to both Fredholm and Volterra integral operators, as well as to optimal control problems involving continuous time. Additionally, we outline how this approach can be extended to approximate fractional derivatives and integrals and propose a fast matrix-vector product algorithm for efficiently computing the fractional Caputo derivative. In the numerical section, we conduct comprehensive experiments on forward and inverse problems. For forward problems, we evaluate the performance of our method on over 50 diverse mathematical problems, including multi-dimensional integral equations, systems of integral equations, partial and fractional integro-differential equations, and various optimal control problems in delay, fractional, multi-dimensional, and nonlinear configurations. For inverse problems, we test our approach on several integral equations and fractional integro-differential problems. Finally, we introduce the pinnies Python package to facilitate the implementation and usability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Inverting the sound speed profile from multi-beam echo sounder data and historical measurements -- a simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ocean's opacity poses challenges for security, as new technology, e.g. underwater drones, offers new opportunities for illegal activities, such as smuggling and terrorism. A network of unmanned surface vehicles (USV) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) offers a potential underwater surveillance solution, but demands high autonomy and compact hardware. For improved situational awareness and efficient operation, sonar performance models may provide the network with sensor coverage maps, but this requires constantly updated environmental information, in particular the present sound speed profile (SSP).
  We propose the inversion of SSPs from multibeam echo sounder (MBES) data in an environment with known topography. The method exploits the two-way travel time from the MBES to the bottom, comparing the measurements to modelled travel time for a proposed SSP model. An acoustic raytracer models the travel time for the SSP model. The inversion problem is shown to be non-unique when basing the cost function on the two-way travel time alone. This is resolved by incorporating a Tikhonov-type regularization term for inclusion of a priori knowledge on the SSPs in addition to the travel time in the final cost function. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are derived from a historical SSP data set, and variance for the EOF coefficients are determined from the same data set. The EOF coefficient distributions are assumed Gaussian and used in the regularization term to limit the search space of the inversion algorithm to physically feasible SSPs. A neural network determines the regularization parameters.
  The method's validity and sensitivity to errors is assessed using synthetic sonar data for the Norwegian Trench. The method accurately recovers SSPs with average root mean square errors of 0.83 m/s. For comparison, the error obtained using state-of-the-art climatology (WOA) is 2.6 m/s.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for the rigid-body response of masonry structures under blast loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of masonry structures to explosions can be hardly investigated relying only on numerical and analytical tools. Experimental tests are of paramount importance for improving the current comprehension and validate existing models. However, experiments involving blast scenarios are, at present, partial and limited in number, compared to tests under different dynamic conditions, such as earthquakes. The reason lies on the fact that full-scale blast experiments present many difficulties, mainly due to the nature of the loading action. Experiments in reduced-scale offer instead greater flexibility. Nevertheless, appropriate scaling laws for the response of masonry structures under blast excitations are needed before performing such tests. We propose here new scaling laws for the dynamic, rigid-body response and failure modes of masonry structures under blast loads. This work takes its roots from previous studies, where closed-form solutions for the rocking response of slender blocks due to explosions have been derived and validated against numerical and experimental tests. The proposed scaling laws are here validated with detailed numerical simulations accounting for combined rocking, up-lifting, and sliding mechanisms of monolithic structures. Then, the application to multi-drum stone columns is considered. In particular, we show that, whilst the presence of complex behaviors, such as wobbling and impacts, similarity is assured. The developments demonstrate their applicability in the design of reduced-scale experiments of masonry structures.</description>

Abstract: A unified construction of $H(\textrm{div})$-conforming finite element tensors, including vector element, symmetric matrix element, traceless matrix element, and, in general, tensors with linear constraints, is developed in this work. It is based on the geometric decomposition of Lagrange elements into bubble functions on each sub-simplex. Each tensor at a sub-simplex is decomposed into tangential and normal components. The tangential component forms the bubble function space, while the normal component characterizes the trace. Some degrees of freedom can be redistributed to $(n-1)$-dimensional faces. The developed finite element spaces are $H(\textrm{div})$-conforming and satisfy the discrete inf-sup condition. Intrinsic bases of the constraint tensor space are also established.</description>

      <title>Blending Neural Operators and Relaxation Methods in PDE Numerical Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks suffer from spectral bias having difficulty in representing the high frequency components of a function while relaxation methods can resolve high frequencies efficiently but stall at moderate to low frequencies. We exploit the weaknesses of the two approaches by combining them synergistically to develop a fast numerical solver of partial differential equations (PDEs) at scale. Specifically, we propose HINTS, a hybrid, iterative, numerical, and transferable solver by integrating a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) with standard relaxation methods, leading to parallel efficiency and algorithmic scalability for a wide class of PDEs, not tractable with existing monolithic solvers. HINTS balances the convergence behavior across the spectrum of eigenmodes by utilizing the spectral bias of DeepONet, resulting in a uniform convergence rate and hence exceptional performance of the hybrid solver overall. Moreover, HINTS applies to large-scale, multidimensional systems, it is flexible with regards to discretizations, computational domain, and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free cut finite element methods for Stokes flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14230v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop two unfitted finite element methods for the Stokes equations using $H^{\text{div}}$-conforming finite elements. Both methods achieve optimal convergence for velocity, ensure pointwise divergence-free velocity fields, and produce well-posed linear systems, regardless of the boundary's position relative to the computational mesh. The first method is a cut finite element discretization of the Stokes equations based on Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM) elements, incorporating interior penalty terms to enforce tangential continuity of velocity at interior mesh edges. The second method involves a cut finite element discretization of a three-field formulation of the Stokes problem, utilizing Raviart-Thomas (RT) space for velocity. We introduce mixed ghost penalty stabilization terms for both methods to ensure stability and to preserve the divergence-free property of the $H^{\text{div}}$-conforming elements, even on unfitted meshes. Boundary conditions in both methods are imposed weakly, which presents challenges: 1) The divergence-free property of the RT and BDM finite elements may be compromised depending on how the normal component of the velocity field at the boundary is imposed. 2) Pressure robustness is influenced by the accuracy of boundary condition enforcement and may fail even if the incompressibility condition holds pointwise. We explore two approaches for weakly imposing the normal component of the boundary velocity: using a penalty parameter with Nitsche's method or a Lagrange multiplier method. We demonstrate that specific conditions on the velocity space are necessary when employing Nitsche's method or penalty. While pressure robustness can be maintained with both approaches by minimizing boundary errors, this comes at the cost of increased condition numbers in the resulting linear systems, whether the mesh is fitted or unfitted to the boundary.</description>

      <title>A fully conservative and shift-invariant formulation for Galerkin discretizations of incompressible variable density flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04813v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a formulation of the variable density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by modifying the nonlinear terms in a consistent way. For Galerkin discretizations, the formulation leads to full discrete conservation of mass, squared density, momentum, angular momentum and kinetic energy without the divergence-free constraint being strongly enforced. In addition to favorable conservation properties, the formulation is shown to make the density field invariant to global shifts. The effect of viscous regularizations on conservation properties is also investigated. Numerical tests validate the theory developed in this work. The new formulation shows superior performance compared to other formulations from the literature, both in terms of accuracy for smooth problems and in terms of robustness.</description>

      <title>A stopping rule for randomly sampling bipartite networks with fixed degree sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04937v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of bipartite networks frequently requires randomly sampling from the set of all bipartite networks with the same degree sequence as an observed network. Trade algorithms offer an efficient way to generate samples of bipartite networks by incrementally `trading' the positions of some of their edges. However, it is difficult to know how many such trades are required to ensure that the sample is random. I propose a stopping rule that focuses on the distance between sampled networks and the observed network, and stops performing trades when this distribution stabilizes. Analyses demonstrate that, for over 650 different degree sequences, using this stopping rule ensures a random sample with a high probability, and that it is practical for use in empirical applications.</description>

      <title>The universal equivariance properties of exotic aromatic B-series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exotic aromatic Butcher series were originally introduced for the calculation of order conditions for the high order numerical integration of ergodic stochastic differential equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and on manifolds. We prove in this paper that exotic aromatic B-series satisfy a universal geometric property, namely that they are characterised by locality and equivariance with respect to orthogonal changes of coordinates. This characterisation confirms that exotic aromatic B-series are a fundamental geometric object that naturally generalises aromatic B-series and B-series, as they share similar equivariance properties. In addition, we provide a classification of the main subsets of the exotic aromatic B-series, in particular the exotic B-series, using different equivariance properties. Along the analysis, we present a generalised definition of exotic aromatic trees, dual vector fields, and we explore the impact of degeneracies on the classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel monolithic algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner for the Taylor-Hood ($\pmb{\mathbb{P}}_2/\mathbb{P}_1$) and Scott-Vogelius ($\pmb{\mathbb{P}}_2/\mathbb{P}_1^{disc}$) discretizations of the Stokes equations. The algorithm is based on the use of the lower-order $\pmb{\mathbb{P}}_1\text{iso}\kern1pt\pmb{\mathbb{P}}_2/\mathbb{P}_1$ operator within a defect-correction setting, in combination with AMG construction of interpolation operators for velocities and pressures. The preconditioning framework is primarily algebraic, though the $\pmb{\mathbb{P}}_1\text{iso}\kern1pt\pmb{\mathbb{P}}_2/\mathbb{P}_1$ operator must be provided. We investigate two relaxation strategies in this setting. Specifically, a novel block factorization approach is devised for Vanka patch systems, which significantly reduces storage requirements and computational overhead, and a Chebyshev adaptation of the LSC-DGS relaxation is developed to improve parallelism. The preconditioner demonstrates robust performance across a variety of 2D and 3D Stokes problems, often matching or exceeding the effectiveness of an inexact block-triangular (or Uzawa) preconditioner, especially in challenging scenarios such as elongated-domain problems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of divergence-preserving unfitted finite element methods for the mixed Poisson problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new H(div)-conforming unfitted finite element method for the mixed Poisson problem which is robust in the cut configuration and preserves conservation properties of body-fitted finite element methods. The key is to formulate the divergence-constraint on the active mesh, instead of the physical domain, in order to obtain robustness with respect to cut configurations without the need for a stabilization that pollutes the mass balance. This change in the formulation results in a slight inconsistency, but does not affect the accuracy of the flux variable. By applying post-processings for the scalar variable, in virtue of classical local post-processings in body-fitted methods, we retain optimal convergence rates for both variables and even the superconvergence after post-processing of the scalar variable. We present the method and perform a rigorous a-priori error analysis of the method and discuss several variants and extensions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present article, we construct a logarithm transformation based Milstein-type method for the stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model evolving in the domain (0,N). The new scheme is explicit and unconditionally boundary and dynamics preserving, when used to solve the stochastic SIS epidemic model. Also, it is proved that the scheme has a strong convergence rate of order one. Different from existing time discretization schemes, the newly proposed scheme for any time step size h &gt; 0, not only produces numerical approximations living in the entire domain (0,N), but also unconditionally reproduces the extinction and persistence behavior of the original model, with no additional requirements imposed on the model parameters. Numerical experiments are presented to verify our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an inexact Newton method for solving real-valued nonlinear eigenvalue problems with eigenvector dependency (NEPv) is introduced that is able to solve the problem on a matrix level. Our main contribution is to derive a variant of Newton's method that uses global Krylov methods such as global GMRES to solve the linear operator equation necessary to compute the Newton correction in a matrix-free way. The advantages that this second order method has over the well-established SCF algorithm are explained and visualized by a variety of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods Using Tensor-Product Summation-by-Parts Operators on Triangles and Tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new class of efficient and robust discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws on curved triangular and tetrahedral unstructured grids. Such discretizations employ a recently introduced family of sparse tensor-product summation-by-parts (SBP) operators in collapsed coordinates within an entropy-stable modal formulation. The proposed algorithms exploit the structure of such SBP operators alongside that of the Proriol-Koornwinder-Dubiner polynomial basis, and a weight-adjusted approximation is used to efficiently invert the local mass matrix for curvilinear elements. Using such techniques, the number of required entropy-conservative two-point flux evaluations between pairs of quadrature nodes is significantly reduced relative to existing entropy-stable formulations using (non-tensor-product) multidimensional SBP operators, particularly for high polynomial degrees, with an improvement in time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(p^{2d})$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^{d+1})$, where $p$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation and $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions. In numerical experiments involving smooth solutions to the compressible Euler equations, the proposed tensor-product schemes demonstrate similar levels of accuracy for a given mesh and polynomial degree to those using multidimensional SBP operators based on symmetric quadrature rules. Furthermore, both operator families are shown to give rise to entropy-stable methods which exhibit excellent robustness for under-resolved problems. Such results suggest that the algorithmic advantages resulting from the use of tensor-product operators are obtained without compromising accuracy or robustness, enabling the efficient extension of the benefits of entropy stability to higher polynomial degrees than previously considered for triangular and tetrahedral elements.</description>

      <title>A unified structure-preserving parametric finite element method for anisotropic surface diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a unified structure-preserving parametric finite element method (SP-PFEM) for the anisotropic surface diffusion of curves in two dimensions $(d=2)$ and surfaces in three dimensions $(d=3)$ with an arbitrary anisotropic surface energy density $\gamma(\boldsymbol{n})$, where $\boldsymbol{n}\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ represents the outward unit vector. By introducing a novel unified surface energy matrix $\boldsymbol{G}_k(\boldsymbol{n})$ depending on $\gamma(\boldsymbol{n})$, the Cahn--Hoffman $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-vector and a stabilizing function $k(\boldsymbol{n}):\ \mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to {\mathbb R}$, we obtain a unified and conservative variational formulation for the anisotropic surface diffusion via different surface differential operators including the surface gradient operator, the surface divergence operator and the surface Laplace--Beltrami operator. A SP-PFEM discretization is presented for the variational problem. In order to establish the unconditional energy stability of the proposed SP-PFEM under a very mild condition on $\gamma(\boldsymbol{n})$, we propose a new framework via {\sl local energy estimate} for proving energy stability/structure-preserving properties of the parametric finite element method for the anisotropic surface diffusion. This framework sheds light on how to prove unconditional energy stability of other numerical methods for geometric partial differential equations. Extensive numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy as well as structure-preserving properties of the proposed SP-PFEM for the anisotropic surface diffusion with arbitrary anisotropic surface energy density $\gamma(\boldsymbol{n})$ arising from different applications.</description>

      <title>Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method: State Estimation from Few Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) estimates a function from its incomplete pointwise measurements. Unfortunately, DEIM suffers large interpolation errors when few measurements are available. Here, we introduce Sparse DEIM (S-DEIM) for accurately estimating a function even when very few measurements are available. To this end, S-DEIM leverages a kernel vector which has been neglected in previous DEIM-based methods. We derive theoretical error estimates for S-DEIM, showing its relatively small error when an optimal kernel vector is used. When the function is generated by a continuous-time dynamical system, we propose a data assimilation algorithm which approximates the optimal kernel vector using observational time series. We prove that, under certain conditions, data assimilated S-DEIM converges exponentially fast towards the true state. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Using $LDL^{T}$ factorizations in Newton's method for solving general large-scale algebraic Riccati equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations can be found in many disciplines in different forms. In the case of small-scale dense coefficient matrices, stabilizing solutions can be computed to all possible formulations of the Riccati equation. This is not the case when it comes to large-scale sparse coefficient matrices. In this paper, we provide a reformulation of the Newton-Kleinman iteration scheme for continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations using indefinite symmetric low-rank factorizations. This allows the application of the method to the case of general large-scale sparse coefficient matrices. We provide convergence results for several prominent realizations of the equation and show in numerical examples the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow for the Gross-Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of the ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) eigenvalue problem with a fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow induced by the $H^1$ norm. For the spatial discretization, we consider the finite element method with quadrature using $P^k$ basis on a simplicial mesh and $Q^k$ basis on a rectangular mesh. We prove the global convergence to a critical point of the discrete GP energy, and establish a local exponential convergence to the ground state under the assumption that the linearized discrete Schr\"odinger operator has a positive spectral gap. We also show that for the $P^1$ finite element discretization with quadrature on an unstructured shape regular simplicial mesh, the eigengap satisfies a mesh-independent lower bound, which implies a mesh-independent local convergence rate for the proposed discrete gradient flow. Numerical experiments with discretization by high order $Q^k$ spectral element methods in two and three dimensions are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of push-forwards on locally analytic functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for investigating analytic maps from finite discrete data. Our approach is to consider the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals, instead of directly handling the analytic map itself. We establish a methodology enabling appropriate finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward from finite discrete data, through the theory of the Fourier--Borel transform and the Fock space. Moreover, we prove a rigorous convergence result with a convergence rate. As an application, we prove that it is not the least-squares polynomial, but the polynomial obtained by truncating its higher-degree terms, that approximates analytic functions and further allows for approximation beyond the support of the data distribution. One advantage of our theory is that it enables us to apply linear algebraic operations to the finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward. Utilizing this, we prove the convergence of a method for approximating an analytic vector field from finite data of the flow map of an ordinary differential equation.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy and efficiency of reduced order models: towards real-world applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter provides an extended overview about Reduced Order Models (ROMs), with a focus on their features in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, the aim is to browse the more common ROM frameworks, considering both intrusive and data-driven approaches. We present the validation of such techniques against several test cases. The first one is an academic benchmark, the thermal block problem, where a Poisson equation is considered. Here a classic intrusive ROM framework based on a Galerkin projection scheme is employed. The second and third test cases come from real-world applications, the one related to the investigation of the blood flow patterns in a patient specific coronary arteries configuration where the Navier Stokes equations are addressed and the other one concerning the granulation process within pharmaceutical industry where a fluid-particle system is considered. Here we employ two data-driven ROM approaches showing a very relevant trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In the last part of the contribution, two novel technological platforms, ARGOS and ATLAS, are presented. They are designed to provide a user-friendly access to data-driven models for real-time predictions for complex biomedical and industrial problems.</description>

      <title>A multigrid reduction framework for domains with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Divergence constraints are present in the governing equations of numerous physical phenomena, and they usually lead to a Poisson equation whose solution represents a bottleneck in many simulation codes. Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) is arguably the most powerful preconditioner for Poisson's equation, and its effectiveness results from the complementary roles played by the smoother, responsible for damping high-frequency error components, and the coarse-grid correction, which in turn reduces low-frequency modes. This work presents several strategies to make AMG more compute-intensive by leveraging reflection, translational and rotational symmetries. AMGR, our final proposal, does not require boundary conditions to be symmetric, therefore applying to a broad range of academic and industrial configurations. It is based on a multigrid reduction framework that introduces an aggressive coarsening to the multigrid hierarchy, reducing the memory footprint, setup and application costs of the top-level smoother. While preserving AMG's excellent convergence, AMGR allows replacing the standard sparse matrix-vector product with the more compute-intensive sparse matrix-matrix product, yielding significant accelerations. Numerical experiments on industrial CFD applications demonstrated up to 70% speed-ups when solving Poisson's equation with AMGR instead of AMG. Additionally, strong and weak scalability analyses revealed no significant degradation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-dimensional beam-shell-solid couplings in linear Cosserat continua via tangential differential calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to the coupling of mixed-dimensional continua by employing the mathematically enriched linear Cosserat micropolar model. The kinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its fundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom intrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different dimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples involving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved graphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block reinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver shells reinforced with graphite beams.</description>

      <title>Distinct Numerical Solutions for Elliptic Cross-Interface Problems Using Finite Element and Finite Difference Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the second-order finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM) for numerically solving elliptic cross-interface problems characterized by vertical and horizontal straight lines, piecewise constant coefficients, two homogeneous jump conditions, continuous source terms, and Dirichlet boundary conditions. For brevity, we consider a 2D simplified version where the intersection points of the interface lines coincide with grid points in uniform Cartesian grids. Our findings reveal interesting and important results: (1) When the coefficient functions exhibit either high jumps with low-frequency oscillations or low jumps with high-frequency oscillations, the finite element method and finite difference method yield similar numerical solutions. (2) However, when the interface problems involve high-contrast and high-frequency coefficient functions, the numerical solutions obtained from the finite element and finite difference methods differ significantly. Given that the widely studied SPE10 benchmark problem (see https://www.spe.org/web/csp/datasets/set02.htm) typically involves high-contrast and high-frequency permeability due to varying geological layers in porous media, this phenomenon warrants attention. Furthermore, this observation is particularly important for developing multiscale methods, as reference solutions for these methods are usually obtained using the standard second-order finite element method with a fine mesh, and analytical solutions are not available. We provide sufficient details to enable replication of our numerical results, and the implementation is straightforward. This simplicity ensures that readers can easily confirm the validity of our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the variance of a stochastic estimator for computing Schatten norms of matrices. The estimator extracts information from a single sketch of the matrix, that is, the product of the matrix with a few standard Gaussian random vectors. While this estimator has been proposed and used in the literature before, the existing variance bounds are often pessimistic. Our work provides a sharper upper bound on the variance and we also give estimates of the variance that work well for numerically low-rank matrices. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments, demonstrating that the new bounds are significantly tighter than the existing ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed statistical finite element (statFEM) approach synthesises measurement data with finite element models and allows for making predictions about the true system response. We provide a probabilistic error analysis for a prototypical statFEM setup based on a Gaussian process prior under the assumption that the noisy measurement data are generated by a deterministic true system response function that satisfies a second-order elliptic partial differential equation for an unknown true source term. In certain cases, properties such as the smoothness of the source term may be misspecified by the Gaussian process model. The error estimates we derive are for the expectation with respect to the measurement noise of the $L^2$-norm of the difference between the true system response and the mean of the statFEM posterior. The estimates imply polynomial rates of convergence in the numbers of measurement points and finite element basis functions and depend on the Sobolev smoothness of the true source term and the Gaussian process model. A numerical example for Poisson's equation is used to illustrate these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual extrapolation methods for monotone inclusions under local Lipschitz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of monotone inclusion (MI) problems of finding a zero of the sum of two monotone operators, in which one operator is maximal monotone while the other is {\it locally Lipschitz} continuous. We propose primal-dual extrapolation methods to solve them using a point and operator extrapolation technique, whose parameters are chosen by a backtracking line search scheme. The proposed methods enjoy an operation complexity of ${\cal O}(\log \epsilon^{-1})$ and ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$, measured by the number of fundamental operations consisting only of evaluations of one operator and resolvent of the other operator, for finding an $\varepsilon$-residual solution of strongly and non-strongly MI problems, respectively. The latter complexity significantly improves the previously best operation complexity ${\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. As a byproduct, complexity results of the primal-dual extrapolation methods are also obtained for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT or $\varepsilon$-residual solution of convex conic optimization, conic constrained saddle point, and variational inequality problems under {\it local Lipschitz} continuity. We provide preliminary numerical results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>On the limits of neural network explainability via descrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the exact solutions to neural network descrambling--a mathematical model for explaining the fully connected layers of trained neural networks (NNs). By reformulating the problem to the minimization of the Brockett function arising in graph matching and complexity theory we show that the principal components of the hidden layer preactivations can be characterized as the optimal explainers or descramblers for the layer weights, leading to descrambled weight matrices. We show that in typical deep learning contexts these descramblers take diverse and interesting forms including (1) matching largest principal components with the lowest frequency modes of the Fourier basis for isotropic hidden data, (2) discovering the semantic development in two-layer linear NNs for signal recovery problems, and (3) explaining CNNs by optimally permuting the neurons. Our numerical experiments indicate that the eigendecompositions of the hidden layer data--now understood as the descramblers--can also reveal the layer's underlying transformation. These results illustrate that the SVD is more directly related to the explainability of NNs than previously thought and offers a promising avenue for discovering interpretable motifs for the hidden action of NNs, especially in contexts of operator learning or physics-informed NNs, where the input/output data has limited human readability.</description>

Abstract: Since optimization on Riemannian manifolds relies on the chosen metric, it is appealing to know that how the performance of a Riemannian optimization method varies with different metrics and how to exquisitely construct a metric such that a method can be accelerated. To this end, we propose a general framework for optimization problems on product manifolds where the search space is endowed with a preconditioned metric, and we develop the Riemannian gradient descent and Riemannian conjugate gradient methods under this metric. Specifically, the metric is constructed by an operator that aims to approximate the diagonal blocks of the Riemannian Hessian of the cost function, which has a preconditioning effect. We explain the relationship between the proposed methods and the variable metric methods, and show that various existing methods, e.g., the Riemannian Gauss--Newton method, can be interpreted by the proposed framework with specific metrics. In addition, we tailor new preconditioned metrics and adapt the proposed Riemannian methods to the canonical correlation analysis and the truncated singular value decomposition problems, and we propose the Gauss--Newton method to solve the tensor ring completion problem. Numerical results among these applications verify that a delicate metric does accelerate the Riemannian optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Measure transport with kernel mean embeddings</title>

Abstract: Kalman filters constitute a scalable and robust methodology for approximate Bayesian inference, matching first and second order moments of the target posterior. To improve the accuracy in nonlinear and non-Gaussian settings, we extend this principle to include more or different characteristics, based on kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Focusing on the continuous-time setting, we develop a family of interacting particle systems (termed $\textit{KME-dynamics}$) that bridge between prior and posterior, and that include the Kalman-Bucy filter as a special case. KME-dynamics does not require the score of the target, but rather estimates the score implicitly and intrinsically, and we develop links to score-based generative modeling and importance reweighting. A variant of KME-dynamics has recently been derived from an optimal transport and Fisher-Rao gradient flow perspective by Maurais and Marzouk, and we expose further connections to (kernelised) diffusion maps, leading to a variational formulation of regression type. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on toy examples and the Lorenz 63 and 96 models, comparing our results against the ensemble Kalman filter and the mapping particle filter (Pulido and van Leeuwen, 2019, J. Comput. Phys.). Our experiments show particular promise for a hybrid modification (called Kalman-adjusted KME-dynamics).</description>

      <title>Swarm-based gradient descent meets simulated annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for non-convex optimization, called Swarm-based Simulated Annealing (SSA), which is at the interface between the swarm-based gradient-descent (SBGD) [J. Lu et. al., ArXiv:2211.17157; E.Tadmor and A. Zenginoglu, Acta Applicandae Math., 190, 2024] and Simulated Annealing (SA) [V. Cerny, J. optimization theory and appl., 45:41-51, 1985; S.Kirkpatrick et. al., Science, 220(4598):671-680, 1983; S. Geman and C.-R. Hwang, SIAM J. Control and Optimization, 24(5):1031-1043, 1986]. Similar to SBGD, we introduce a swarm of agents, each identified with a position, ${\mathbf x}$ and mass $m$, to explore the ambient space. Similar to SA, the agents proceed in the gradient descent direction, and are subject to Brownian motion. The annealing rate, however, is dictated by a decreasing function of their mass. As a consequence, instead of the SA protocol for time-decreasing temperature, we let the swarm decide how to `cool down' agents, depending on their accumulated mass over time. The dynamics of masses is coupled with the dynamics of positions: agents at higher ground transfer (part of) their mass to those at lower ground. Consequently, resulting SSA optimizer is dynamically divided between heavier, cooler agents viewed as `leaders' and lighter, warmer agents viewed as `explorers'. Mean-field convergence analysis and benchmark optimizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the swarm-based method as a multi-dimensional global optimizer.</description>

      <title>Automatic Differentiation is Essential in Training Neural Networks for Solving Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14099</link>

Abstract: Neural network-based approaches have recently shown significant promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering, especially in scenarios featuring complex domains or incorporation of empirical data. One advantage of the neural network methods for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving PDEs.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient Splitting Methods for Convex-Concave Saddle-Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based a novel primal-dual dynamical model with adaptive scaling parameters and Bregman divergences, we propose new accelerated primal-dual proximal gradient splitting methods for solving bilinear saddle-point problems with provable optimal nonergodic convergence rates. For the first, using the spectral analysis, we show that a naive extension of acceleration model for unconstrained optimization problems to a quadratic game is unstable. Motivated by this, we present an accelerated primal-dual hybrid gradient (APDHG) flow which combines acceleration with careful velocity correction. To work with non-Euclidean distances, we also equip our APDHG model with general Bregman divergences and prove the exponential decay of a Lyapunov function. Then, new primal-dual splitting methods are developed based on proper semi-implicit Euler schemes of the continuous model, and the theoretical convergence rates are nonergodic and optimal with respect to the matrix norms,\, Lipschitz constants and convexity parameters. Thanks to the primal and dual scaling parameters, both the algorithm designing and convergence analysis cover automatically the convex and (partially) strongly convex objectives. Moreover, the use of Bregman divergences not only unifies the standard Euclidean distances and general cases in an elegant way, but also makes our methods more flexible and adaptive to problem-dependent metrics.</description>

      <title>On the logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases. In particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the lowest logarithmic energy of the family.</description>
