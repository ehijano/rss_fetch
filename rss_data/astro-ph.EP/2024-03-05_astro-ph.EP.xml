      <title>Jupiter's Polar Vortex Crystals Explored using the Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the poles of Jupiter, cyclonic vortices are clustered together in patterns made up of equilateral triangles called vortex crystals. Such patterns are seen in laboratory flows but never before in a planetary atmosphere, where the planet's rotation and gravity add new physics. Here we use the shallow water (SW) equations at the pole of a rotating planet to study the emergence and evolution of vortices starting from an initial random pattern of small-scale turbulence. The flow is in a single layer with a free surface whose slope produces the horizontal pressure gradient force. We explored three parameters in the problem: the mean kinetic energy of the initial turbulence, the horizontal scale of the initial turbulence, and the radius of deformation of the undisturbed fluid layer. We find that some regions of this parameter space lead to vortex crystals and others lead to chaotic behavior and mergers. Our results identified that the relative change of the layer thickness is the key quantity that determines whether the vortex crystal or chaotic patterns emerge.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam Imaging of Young Stellar Objects III: Detailed Imaging of the Nebular Environment Around the HL Tau Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program "Direct Imaging of YSOs" (program ID 1179), we use JWST NIRCam's direct imaging mode in F187N, F200W, F405N, and F410M to perform high contrast observations of the circumstellar structures surrounding the protostar HL Tau. The data reveal the known stellar envelope, outflow cavity, and streamers, but do not detect any companion candidates. We detect scattered light from an in-flowing spiral streamer previously detected in $\textrm{HCO}^+$ by ALMA, and part of the structure connected to the c-shaped outflow cavity. For detection limits in planet mass we use BEX evolutionary tracks when $M_\textrm{p}&lt;2M_\textrm{J}$ and AMES-COND evolutionary tracks otherwise, assuming a planet age of 1 Myr (youngest available age). Inside the disk region, due to extended envelope emission, our point-source sensitivities are $\sim5$ mJy ($37~M_{\rm J}$) at 40 AU in F187N, and $\sim0.37$ mJy ($5.2~M_{\rm J}$) at 140 AU in F405N. Outside the disk region, the deepest limits we can reach are $\sim0.01$ mJy ($0.75~M_{\rm J}$) at a projected separation of $\sim525$ AU.</description>

      <title>Examining the detectability of ringing on highly eccentric exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Eccentric exoplanets offer an opportunity to study the response of an atmosphere to changing thermal forcing and the robustness of the superrotating equatorial jet seen on tidally locked hot Jupiters. However, the atmospheric dynamics on eccentric planets strongly depend on the planetary rotation period, which is difficult to constrain observationally. The ringing phenomenon, whereby the observed emission increases and decreases after the periastron passage as the flash-heated hemisphere rotates in and out of view, can provide a tight constraint on rotation. Aims. We examine which of the highly eccentric transiting exoplanets HAT-P-2 b, HD 80606 b, TOI-3362 b, TOI-4127 b and HD 17156 b displays sufficiently strong ringing signals for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to detect. Methods. We implemented the treatment of eccentricity and non-synchronous rotation in the non-grey climate model expeRT/MITgcm and generate synthetic light curves. Results. We find four detectable ringing peaks on HD 80606 b and some undetectable ringing on TOI-4127 b and HD 17156 b. The lack of clouds, photo-chemistry and obliquity in our models may lead us to overestimate the amplitude of the ringing however. The strength of the ringing signal is mostly determined by the eccentricity, planetary rotation period, planet-to-star radius ratio and apparent magnitude of the system. We seek more exoplanets that could show ringing but find no candidates as promising as HD 80606 b. Conclusions. We recommend prioritising HD 80606 b as a target for ringing with JWST. A baseline of five days after the periastron passage captures three ringing peaks, sufficient to tightly constrain the planetary rotation period. An extension to seven days adds a fourth peak, verifying the rotation period.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI/MRS Observations of T Cha: Discovery of a Spatially Resolved Disk Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding when and how circumstellar disks disperse is crucial to constrain planet formation and migration. Thermal winds powered by high-energy stellar photons have long been theorized to drive disk dispersal. However, evidence for these winds is currently based only on small (~3-6 km/s) blue-shifts in [Ne II] 12.81 um lines, which does not exclude MHD winds. We report JWST MIRI MRS spectro-imaging of T Cha, a disk with a large dust gap (~30 au in radius) and blue-shifted [Ne II] emission. We detect four forbidden noble gas lines, [Ar II], [Ar III], [Ne II], and [Ne III], of which [Ar III] is the first detection in any protoplanetary disk. We use line flux ratios to constrain the energy of the ionizing photons and find that Argon is ionized by EUV whereas Neon is most likely ionized by X-rays. After performing continuum and Point Spread Function (PSF) subtraction on the IFU cube, we discover a spatial extension in the [Ne II] emission off the disk continuum emission. This is the first spatially resolved [Ne II] disk wind emission. The mostly ionic spectrum of T Cha, in combination with the extended [Ne II] emission, points to an evolved stage for any inner MHD wind and is consistent with the existence of an outer thermal wind ionized and driven by high-energy stellar photons. This work acts as a pathfinder for future observations aiming at investigating disk dispersal using JWST.</description>

      <title>A Search for Temporal Atmospheric Variability of $\textit{Kepler}$ Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic search for atmospheric variability in short-period gas-giant planets (hot Jupiters) observed by the Kepler mission, by looking for temporal variability of their secondary eclipse depths. This is motivated by a recent detection of a decrease in the dayside brightness of KELT-1 b between TESS Sectors 17 and 57, separated by about 3 years. We fit the Kepler light curves of 53 hot Jupiters and measure their secondary eclipse depths during individual Kepler quarters and 4-quarter windows. We detect the secondary eclipses in individual quarters or four-quarter windows for 17 out of the 53 systems. In those 17 systems we do not detect statistically significant astrophysical variation in the secondary eclipse depths. We show that the data is sensitive to the variability seen for KELT-1 b in TESS data. Therefore, the absence of detected secondary eclipse variability in Kepler data suggests that the atmospheric variability in KELT-1 b is not common. In addition, several of the 53 targets we investigated display variability in their transit depths with a period of 4 quarters (1 year). This instrumental signal is likely present in the light curves of other transiting planets we did not analyze and other variable stars observed by Kepler. Finally, we find that Kepler-488 b has a secondary eclipse depth that is unphysically large for a planet, and thus is likely a misclassified red dwarf.</description>

      <title>Europa's structural conditions for the existence of subsurface ocean and the absence of metallic core-driven magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europa's interior is expected to be divided into the metallic core, rocky mantle and hydrosphere based on the moment of inertia factor estimated from gravity field measurements. Specifically, the thickness of the outermost water layer is 120-170 km, and the radius of the metallic core is 0.12-0.43 times the surface radius. No systematic study of Europa's internal evolution has been conducted to estimate the current state of the subsurface ocean and to explain the absence of a core dynamo field within such uncertainty for internal structure and material properties. Herein, I performed a numerical simulation of the long-term thermal evolution of Europa's interior and investigated the temporal changes in the ocean thickness as well as the temperature and heat flow of the metallic core. If the ice reference viscosity is greater than 5$\times$10$^{14}$ Pa s, the ocean can persist even in the absence of tidal heating. In the case of a tidal heating of 10 and 20 mW/m$^{2}$, the ice shell thickness is $\le$90 km if the ice viscosity is $\ge$1$\times$10$^{15}$ and 1$\times$10$^{14}$ Pa s, respectively. Regardless of the ice viscosity, if the tidal heating is $\ge$50 mW/m$^{2}$, the shell thickness will be $\le$40 km. The thermal history of the metallic core is determined by the hydrosphere thickness and the metallic core density, and is unaffected by variations in the ice shell (ocean) thickness. Preferred conditions for the absence of the core dynamo include CI chondritic abundance for the long-lived radioactive isotopes, lower initial core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature and thicker hydrosphere. The core may be molten without convection if the composition is near the eutectic in a Fe-FeS alloy, or not molten (without convection) if the composition is near the Fe or FeS endmember.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LIV. Multiple molecular species in the atmosphere of HAT-P-11 b and review of the HAT-P-11 planetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheric characterisation of hot and warm Neptune-size exoplanets is challenging due to their small radius and atmospheric scale height. The warm-Neptune HAT-P-11b is a remarkable target for such characterisation due to the large brightness of its host star (V=9.46 mag; H=7.13 mag). This work aims at: (i) reviewing the main physical and architectural properties of the HAT-P-11 planetary system; (ii) probing the presence of 8 molecular species in the atmosphere of HAT-P-11b at high spectral resolution in the near-Infrared. The planetary system was reviewed by analysing transits and occultations of HAT-P-11b from the Kepler data set as well as HIRES at Keck archival radial-velocity (RV) data. The latter were modelled with Gaussian-Process regression and a combined quasi-periodic and squared-exponential kernel to account for stellar variations on both (short-term) rotation and (long-term) activity-cycle timescales. To probe the atmospheric composition of HAT-P-11b, 4 transits of this target were observed with GIANO-B at TNG. We find that the long-period ($P\sim9.3$ years) RV signal previously attributed to planet HAT-P-11c is more likely due to the stellar magnetic activity cycle. Nonetheless, the Hipparcos-Gaia difference in proper motion anomaly suggests that an outer-bound companion might still exist. For HAT-P-11b, we measure a radius $R_{\rm p}=0.4466\pm0.0059\,R_{\rm J}$, a mass $M_{\rm p}=0.0787\pm0.0048\,M_{\rm J}$, and an eccentricity $e=0.2577^{+0.0033}_{-0.0025}$, in accordance with values in the literature. Probing its atmosphere, we detect the presence of $NH_3$ (S/N$=5.3$, significance$=5.0\sigma$) and confirm the presence of $H_2O$ (S/N$=5.1$, significance$=3.4\sigma$). We also tentatively detect the signal of $CO_2$ (S/N$=3.0$, significance$=3.2\sigma$) and $CH_4$ (S/N$=4.8$, significance$=2.6\sigma$), whose presence need to be confirmed by further observations.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopy of comets using Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing the vibrational/rotational lines in a comet's optical spectrum requires high-resolution spectroscopy, as they are otherwise seen as a blended feature. To achieve this, we have obtained medium and high-resolution (R ($\lambda/\Delta \lambda$) = 30000 and 60000) spectra of several comets, including C/2015 V2 (Johnson), 46P/Wirtanen, 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kres\'ak and 38P/Stephan-Oterma, using the Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) mounted on the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in India. The spectra effectively cover the wavelength range 3700 - 10,000 {\AA}, allowing us to probe the various vibrational bands and band sequences to identify the rotational lines in the cometary molecular emission. We were also able to separate the cometary Oxygen lines from the telluric lines and analyse the green-to-red (G/R) forbidden oxygen [OI] ratios in a few comets. For comets C/2015 V2, 46P, and 41P, the computed G/R ratios, 0.04$\pm$0.01, 0.04$\pm$0.01, and 0.08$\pm$0.02 respectively, point to H$_2$O being a major source of Oxygen emissions. Notably, in the second fibre pointing at a location 1000 km away from the photocenter of comet 46P, the G/R ratio reduced by more than half the value observed in the first fibre, indicating the effects of quenching within the inner coma. We also measured the NH$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio of comet 46P to be about 3.41$\pm$0.05 and derived an ammonia ratio of 1.21$\pm$0.03 corresponding to a spin temperature of $\sim$26 K. With these, we present the results of the study of four comets from different cometary reservoirs using medium and high-resolution optical spectroscopy, emphasising the capabilities of the instrument for future cometary studies.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Dependence of Microlensing Planet Frequency on The Host Star Mass and Galactocentric Distance by using a Galactic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, $M_{\rm L}$, and distance from the Galactic center, $R_{\rm L}$, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel}$, and the Einstein radius crossing time, $t_{\rm E}$, measured for 22 planetary events from \citet{suz16} with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to $M_{\rm L}^m R_{\rm L}^r$, we calculate the likelihood distribution of $(m,r)$. We estimate that $r = 0.10^{+0.51}_{-0.37}$ and $m = 0.50^{+0.90}_{-0.70}$ under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. %This result suggests that planets are uniformly distributed in the Galaxy and more massive stars are more likely to possess planets. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, $q$, and estimate that $m=-0.08^{+0.95}_{-0.65}$ for $q &lt; 10^{-3}$ and $1.25^{+1.07}_{-1.14}$ for $q &gt; 10^{-3}$. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.</description>

      <title>ROME IV. The Arecibo Search for Substellar Magnetospheric Radio Emissions in Purported Exoplanet-Hosting Systems at 5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma flow-obstacle interactions, such as those between an exoplanet's magnetosphere and the host star's stellar wind, may lead to detectable radio emissions. Despite many attempts to detect magnetospheric (auroral) radio emissions from exoplanets, a reproducible, unambiguous detection remains elusive. This fourth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of nine nearby systems that host exoplanet, brown dwarf, and low-mass-stellar companions conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz. This search for magnetospheric radio emissions has the greatest sensitivity ($\sim$1 mJy during $&lt;$1 s integration times) and collected full Stokes parameters over the largest simultaneous bandpass of any survey to date. It is also the first survey to search for radio emission from brown dwarfs of spectral class Y, which may illuminate open questions regarding their magnetism, interior and atmospheric structure, and formation histories. No magnetospheric radio emissions from substellar companions were detected. These results are examined within the context of recent theoretical work on plasma flow-obstacle interactions, and radio emissions observed from the solar system planets and ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Towards atmospheric retrievals of panchromatic light-curves: ExPLOR-ing generalized inversion techniques for transiting exoplanets with JWST and Ariel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional atmospheric retrieval codes are designed to extract information, such as chemical abundances, thermal structures and cloud properties, from fully "reduced" spectra obtained during transit or eclipse. Reduced spectra, however, are assembled by fitting a series of simplified light-curves to time series observations, wavelength-by-wavelength. Thus, spectra are a post-processed summary statistics of the original data, which by definition does not encode all the available information (i.e., astrophysical signal, model covariance, instrumental noise). Here, we explore an alternative inversion strategy where the atmospheric retrieval is performed on the light-curve directly -- i.e., closer to the data. This method is implemented in ExPLOR (EXoplanet Panchromatic Light-curve Observation and Retrieval), a novel atmospheric retrieval code inheriting from the TauREx project. By explicitly considering time in the model, ExPLOR naturally handles transit, eclipse, phase-curve and other complex geometries for transiting exoplanets. In this paper, we have validated this new technique by inverting simulated panchromatic light-curves. The model was tested on realistic simulations of a WASP-43b like exoplanet as observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel telescope. By comparing our panchromatic light-curve approach against conventional spectral retrievals on mock scenarios, we have identified key breaking points in information and noise propagation when employing past literature techniques. Throughout the paper, we discuss the importance of developing "closer-to-data" approaches such as the method presented in this work, and highlight the inevitable increase in model complexity and computing requirements associated with the recent JWST revolution.</description>

Abstract: The study of planets and small bodies within our Solar System is fundamental for understanding the formation and evolution the Earth and other planets. Compositional and meteorological studies of the giant planets provide a foundation for understanding the nature of the most commonly observed exoplanets, while spectroscopic observations of the atmospheres of terrestrial planets, moons, and comets provide insights into the past and present-day habitability of planetary environments, and the availability of the chemical ingredients for life. While prior and existing (sub)millimeter observations have led to major advances in these areas, progress is hindered by limitations in the dynamic range, spatial and temporal coverage, as well as sensitivity of existing telescopes and interferometers. Here, we summarize some of the key planetary science use cases that factor into the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a proposed 50-m class single dish facility: (1) to more fully characterize planetary wind fields and atmospheric thermal structures, (2) to measure the compositions of icy moon atmospheres and plumes, (3) to obtain detections of new, astrobiologically relevant gases and perform isotopic surveys of comets, and (4) to perform synergistic, temporally-resolved measurements in support of dedicated interplanetary space missions. The improved spatial coverage (several arcminutes), resolution ($\sim1.2''-12''$), bandwidth (several tens of GHz), dynamic range ($\sim10^5$) and sensitivity ($\sim1$~mK km s$^{-1}$) required by these science cases would enable new insights into the chemistry and physics of planetary environments, the origins of prebiotic molecules and the habitability of planetary systems in general.</description>

      <title>Latitude-dependent Atmospheric Waves and Long-period Modulations in Luhman 16 B from the Longest Lightcurve of an Extrasolar World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the longest photometric monitoring of up to 1200 hours of the strongly variable brown-dwarf binaries Luhman 16 AB and provide evidence of $\pm$5% variability on a timescale of several-to-hundreds of hours for this object. We show that short-period rotational modulation around 5 hours (k = 1 wavenumber) and 2.5 hours (k = 2 wavenumber) dominate the variability under 10 hours, where the planetary-scale waves model composed of k = 1 and k = 2 waves provides good fits to both the periodogram and light curve. In particular, models consisting of three to four sine waves could explain the variability of light curve durations up to 100 hours. We show that the relative range of k = 2 periods is narrower compared to k = 1 period. Using simple models of zonal banding in Solar System giants, we suggest that the difference in period range arises from the difference in windspeed distribution at low and mid-to-high latitudes in the atmosphere. Lastly, we show that Luhman 16 AB also exhibits long-period $\pm$5% variability with periods ranging from 15 hours up to 100 hours over the longest monitoring of this object. Our results on k = 1 and k = 2 waves and long-period evolution are consistent with previous 3D atmosphere simulations, demonstrating that both latitude-dependent waves and slow-varying atmospheric features are potentially present in Luhman 16 AB atmospheres and are significant contribution to the light curve modulation over hundreds of rotations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of charged particles in Earth's magnetosphere: an approach to the Van Allen belts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's magnetosphere, beyond protecting the ozone layer, is a natural phenomena which allows to study the interaction between charged particles from solar activity and electromagnetic fields. In this paper we studied trajectories of charged particles interacting with a constant dipole magnetic field as first approach of the Earth's magnetosphere using different initial conditions. As a result of this interaction there is a formation of well defined radiation regions by a confinement of charged particles around the lines of the magnetic field. These regions, called Van Allen radiation belts, are described by classical electrodynamics and appear naturally in the numerical modeling done in this work.</description>

      <title>A clear case for dust obscuration of the lunar retroreflectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The passive retroreflector arrays placed on the moon by Apollo 11, 14 and 15 astronauts continue to produce valuable Earth-Moon range measurements that enable high-precision tests of gravitational physics, as well as studies of geo- and selenophysics. The optical throughput of these retroreflectors has declined since their deployment, with an additional signal loss at full moon when the reflectors experience direct solar illumination. We show that the loss in return rate can be attributed to the accumulation of a thin layer of lunar dust on the surfaces of the corner cube retroreflectors. First, a careful analysis of the optical link budget for the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) experiment reveals that the lunar return rate is 15--20 times smaller than predicted, a deficit that can be explained by a reflector dust covering fraction of ${\sim} 50$\%. Second, range measurements taken during a lunar eclipse indicate that the solar illumination of the retroreflectors degrades their throughput by an additional factor of ${\sim}15$. Finally, a numerical simulation of heat transfer in dust-coated reflectors is able to model the resulting thermal lensing effect, in which thermal gradients in the retroreflectors degrade their far-field diffraction pattern. A comparison of this simulation to eclipse measurements finds a dust coverage fraction of ${\sim}50$%. Taken together, the link analysis, eclipse observations and thermal modeling support the claim that the retroreflectors are obscured by lunar dust, with both link budget and simulation independently finding the dust fraction to be $\sim$50%.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Our Galaxy</title>

Abstract: As we learn more about the multi-scale interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy, we develop a greater understanding for the complex relationships between the large-scale diffuse gas and dust in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), how it moves, how it is affected by the nearby massive stars, and which portions of those GMCs eventually collapse into star forming regions. The complex interactions of those gas, dust and stellar populations form what has come to be known as the ecology of our Galaxy. Because we are deeply embedded in the plane of our Galaxy, it takes up a significant fraction of the sky, with complex dust lanes scattered throughout the optically recognisable bands of the Milky Way. These bands become bright at (sub-)millimetre wavelengths, where we can study dust thermal emission and the chemical and kinematic signatures of the gas. To properly study such large-scale environments, requires deep, large area surveys that are not possible with current facilities. Moreover, where stars form, so too do planetary systems, growing from the dust and gas in circumstellar discs, to planets and planetesimal belts. Understanding the evolution of these belts requires deep imaging capable of studying belts around young stellar objects to Kuiper belt analogues around the nearest stars. Here we present a plan for observing the Galactic Plane and circumstellar environments to quantify the physical structure, the magnetic fields, the dynamics, chemistry, star formation, and planetary system evolution of the galaxy in which we live with AtLAST; a concept for a new, 50m single-dish sub-mm telescope with a large field of view which is the only type of facility that will allow us to observe our Galaxy deeply and widely enough to make a leap forward in our understanding of our local ecology.</description>

      <title>On the Arnold diffusion mechanism in Medium Earth Orbit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space debris mitigation guidelines represent the most effective method to preserve the circumterrestrial environment. Among them, end-of-life disposal solutions play a key role. A growing effort is devoted to exploit natural perturbations to lead the satellites towards an atmospheric reentry, reducing the disposal cost, also if departing from high-altitude regions. In the case of the Medium Earth Orbit region, home of the navigation satellites (like Galileo), the main driver is the gravitational perturbation due to the Moon, that can increase the eccentricity in the long term. In this way, the pericenter altitude can get into the atmospheric drag domain and the satellite can eventually reenter.
  In this work, we show how an Arnold diffusion mechanism can trigger the eccentricity growth. Focusing on the case of Galileo, we consider a hierarchy of Hamiltonian models, assuming that the main perturbations on the motion of the spacecraft are the oblateness of the Earth and the gravitational attraction of the Moon. First, the Moon is assumed to lay on the ecliptic plane and periodic orbits and associated stable and unstable invariant manifolds are computed for various energy levels, in the neighborhood of a given resonance. Along each invariant manifold, the eccentricity increases naturally, achieving its maximum at the first intersection between them. This growth is, however, not sufficient to achieve reentry. By moving to a model where the inclination of the Moon is taken into account, the problem becomes non-autonomous and the satellite is able to move along different energy levels. Under the ansatz of transversality of the manifolds in the autonomous case, checked numerically, Poincar\'e-Melnikov techniques are applied to show how diffusion can be attained, by constructing a sequence of homoclinic orbits that connect invariant tori at different energy levels.</description>

Abstract: Current and upcoming large optical and near-infrared astronomical surveys have fundamental science as their primary drivers. To cater to those, these missions scan large frac- tions of the entire sky at multiple wavelengths and epochs. These aspects make these data sets also valuable for investigations into astronomical hazards for life on Earth. The Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA) is a partner in several optical / near-infrared surveys. In this paper we focus on the astronomical hazard value for two sets of those: the surveys with the OmegaCAM wide-field imager at the VST and with the Euclid Mission. For each of them we provide a brief overview of the astronomical survey hardware, the data and the information systems. We present first results related to the astronomical hazard investigations. We evaluate to what extent the existing functionality of the information systems covers the needs for the astronomical hazard investigations</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the stellar activity of M dwarfs. II. Relationship between Ca, H$\alpha$, and Na chromospheric emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chromospheric emission estimated in the core of different lines, such as Ca II H &amp; K, Na D1 and D2, and Halpha, is not always correlated between lines, as the Ca II H &amp; K and Halpha emission time series are anti-correlated for a few percent of the stars, contrary to what is observed on the Sun. This puzzling result has been observed for both solar-type and M stars. Our objective is to characterise these relationships in more detail using complementary criteria, based on a set of spectra obtained with HARPS for a large sample of M dwarfs, to evaluate whether or not additional processes are required to explain the observations. We analysed the time average and variability of the Ca, Na, and Halpha emissions for 177 M0-M8 stars. We computed synthetic Halpha time series based on different assumptions of plage properties. The statistical properties of our sample, in terms of correlations and slopes between indices at different timescales, differ from what we previously obtained for FGK stars, with fewer stars with a null correlation, and a weaker dependence of the correlations on timescale. However, there can be a large dispersion from one season to another for stars. We find a clear indication of a change in the slope sign from the relation between averaged Ca (or Na) and Halpha for the most massive M dwarfs, as well as a change in slope in the Na-Ca relation. At this stage, we are not able to find simple plage properties that, alone, are sufficient to reproduce the observations. Simulations shows that it is not straightforward to compare the temporal variability correlation and the integrated indices and demonstrate the need for complex activity patterns to explain some of the observations. We conclude that the relation between these indices exhibits a large diversity in behaviour. More detailed simulations with complex activity patterns are necessary to understand these observations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T Tauri stars with UVIT/AstroSat: probing accretion process in young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T-Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs ($&gt;10^4$ K) are also found to be relatively higher than that in WTTSs ($&lt;8500$ K). From the UV excess, we have re-classified two WTTSs (BS Tau, V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), showing strong H$\alpha$ line emission. We find that CTTS show strong excess emission in both FUV ($&gt;$10$^7$) and NUV ($&gt;$10$^3$) bands, while WTTS show strong excess only in the FUV ($\lesssim$10$^5$), suggesting that excess emission in NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and H$\alpha$ luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.21$\pm$0.17 and intercept of 2.18$\pm$0.56.</description>

Abstract: We used VLT/SPHERE to observe 20 systems in the Cha I cloud in polarized scattered light in the near-infrared. We combined the scattered light observations with existing literature data on stellar properties and with archival ALMA continuum data to study trends with system age and dust mass. We also connected resolved near-infrared observations with the spectral energy distributions of the systems. In 13 of the 20 systems included in this study we detected resolved scattered light signals from circumstellar dust. For the CR Cha, CT Cha, CV Cha, SY Cha, SZ Cha, and VZ Cha systems we present the first detailed descriptions of the disks in scattered light. The observations found typically smooth or faint disks, often with little substructure, with the notable exceptions of SZ Cha, which shows an extended multiple-ringed disk, and WW Cha, which shows interaction with the cloud environment. New high S/N K- band observations of the HD 97048 system in our survey reveal a significant brightness asymmetry that may point to disk misalignment and subsequent shadowing of outer disk regions, possibly related to the suggested planet candidate in the disk. We resolve for the first time the stellar binary in the CS Cha system. Multiple wavelength observations of the disk around CS Cha have revealed that the system contains small, compact dust grains that may be strongly settled, consistent with numerical studies of circumbinary disks. We find in our sample that there is a strong anti-correlation between the presence of a (close) stellar companion and the detection of circumstellar material with five of our seven nondetections located in binary systems.</description>

Abstract: We present SPHERE/IRDIS H-band data for a sample of 23 stars in the Orion Star forming region observed within the DESTINYS (Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars) program. We use polarization differential imaging in order to detect scattered light from circumstellar dust. From the scattered light observations we characterize the disk orientation, radius and contrast. We analyse the disks in context of the stellar parameters and the environment of the Orion star-forming region. We use ancillary X-shooter spectroscopic observations to characterize the central stars in the systems. We furthermore use a combination of new and archival ALMA mm-continuum observations to characterize the dust masses present in the circumstellar disks. Within our sample we detect extended circumstellar disks in 10 of 23 systems. Of these, three are exceptionally extended (V351 Ori, V599 Ori and V1012 Ori) and show scattered light asymmetries which may indicate perturbations by embedded planets or (in the case of V599 Ori) by an outer stellar companion. Our high resolution imaging observations are also sensitive to close (sub)stellar companions and we detect 9 such objects in our sample of which 5 were previously unknown. We find in particular a possible sub-stellar companion (either a very low mass star or a high mass brown dwarf) 137 au from the star RY Ori. We find a strong anti-correlation between disk detection and multiplicity, with only 2 of our 10 disk detections located in stellar multiple systems. We also find a correlation between scattered light contrast and the millimetre flux suggesting that disks that have a high dust content are typically bright in near-infrared scattered light. Conversely we do not find significant correlations between scattered light contrast of the disks and the stellar mass or age.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sample of planet-forming disks observed by high-contrast imaging campaigns over the last decade is mature enough to enable the demographical analysis of individual star-forming regions. We present the full census of Taurus sources with VLT/SPHERE polarimetric images available. The whole sample sums up to 43 targets (of which 31 have not been previously published) corresponding to one-fifth of the Class II population in Taurus and about half of such objects that are observable. A large fraction of the sample is apparently made up of isolated faint disks (equally divided between small and large self-shadowed disks). Ambient signal is visible in about one-third of the sample. This probes the interaction with the environment and with companions or the outflow activity of the system. The central portion of the Taurus region almost exclusively hosts faint disks, while the periphery also hosts bright disks interacting with their surroundings. The few bright disks are found around apparently older stars. The overall picture is that the Taurus region is in an early evolutionary stage of planet formation. Yet, some objects are discussed individually, as in an intermediate or exceptional stage of the disk evolution. This census provides a first benchmark for the comparison of the disk populations in different star forming regions.</description>

Abstract: We report new observations of the classical T~Tauri star CI~Tau with the SPIRou near-infrared spectropolarimeter and velocimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) in late 2019, 2020 and 2022, complemented with observations obtained with the ESPaDOnS optical spectropolarimeter at CFHT in late 2020. From our SPIRou and ESPaDOnS spectra, to which we applied Least-Squares Deconvolution, we infer longitudinal fields clearly modulated with the 9-d rotation period of CI~Tau. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology, first from SPIRou data only in all three seasons, then from our 2020 SPIRou and ESPaDOnS data simultaneously. We find that CI~Tau hosts a mainly axisymmetric poloidal field, with a 1~kG dipole slightly tilted to the rotation axis and dark spots close to the pole that coincide with the footpoints of accretion funnels linking the star to the inner disc. Our results also suggest that CI~Tau accretes mass from the disc in a stable fashion. We further find that radial velocities (RV) derived from atomic and CO lines in SPIRou spectra are both rotationally modulated, but with a much lower amplitude than that expected from the putative candidate planet CI~Tau~b. We confirm the presence of a RV signal at a period of 23.86~d reported in a separate analysis, but detect it clearly in CO lines only and not in atomic lines, suggesting that it likely traces a non-axisymmetric structure in the inner disc of CI~Tau rather than a massive close-in planet.</description>

      <title>Zonostrophic turbulence in the subsurface oceans of the Jovian and Saturnian moons</title>

Abstract: In order to characterize the global circulation of the subsurface ocean of Jovian and Saturnian moons, we analyze the properties of 21 three-dimensional simulations of Boussinesq thermal convection in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. Flow is driven by an adverse temperature contrast imposed across the domain, and is subjected to no-slip boundary conditions. We cover a region of parameter space previously unexplored by global simulations, both in terms of rapid rotation and vigor of convective forcing, closer to, yet still admittedly far from, the conditions appropriate for the subsurface ocean of Ganymede, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Our most extreme simulations exhibit a dynamic global circulation that combines powerful east-west zonal jets, planetary waves, and vortices. A spectral analysis of the kinetic energy distribution performed in cylindrical geometry reveals a high degree of anisotropy of the simulated flows. Specifically, the axisymmetric zonal energy spectra follow a steep $-5$ slope in wavenumber space, with the energy amplitude exclusively controlled by the rotation rate. In contrast, the non-axisymmetric residual spectra display a gentle $-5/3$ slope, with the energy amplitude controlled by the thermal buoyancy input power. This spectral behavior conforms with the theory of zonostrophic turbulence and allows us to propose tentative extrapolations of these findings to the more extreme conditions of icy satellites. By assuming that kinetic energy dissipates via Ekman friction we predict an upper bound for the zonal velocity ranging from a few centimeters per second for Enceladus to about one meter per second for Ganymede, with residual velocities smaller than the zonal velocity by an order of magnitude on each moon. These predictions yield typical jets size approaching the ocean depth of Titan, Ganymede and Europa and $10$ to $40\%$ of the ocean depth on Enceladus.</description>

      <title>The initial state of Pluto-Charon with Tidal Evolution</title>

Abstract: This study explores the gravitational interaction between Pluto and its moon Charon, which has led to their synchronous orbit, where they consistently show the same face to each other. This process is known as tidal evolution, which explains how the gravitational pull between two celestial bodies can adjust their spinning speeds until they match their orbital speed. By simulating various initial conditions, we aim to understand the specific paths Pluto and Charon might have taken to reach their current stage. We observe that the tilt of their orbits has a negligible long-term effect, typically stabilizing quickly. In our analysis, we examine a scenario when the orbital size initially increases, leading to an increased orbit and a high eccentricity, a phenomenon attributed to the dissipation of tidal energy.</description>

      <title>The "Drake equation" of exomoons -- a cascade of formation, stability and detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After 25 years of the prediction of the possibility of observations, and despite the many hundreds of well studied transiting exoplanet systems, we are still waiting for the announcement of the first confirmed exomoon. We follow the ``cascade'' structure of the Drake equation, but apply it to the chain of events leading to a successful detection of an exomoon. The scope of this paper is to reveal the structure of the problem, rather than to give a quantitative solution. We identify three important steps that can lead us to discovery. The steps are the formation, the orbital dynamics and long-term stability, and the observability of a given exomoon in a given system. This way, the question will be closely related to questions of star formation, planet formation, 5 possible pathways of moon formation; long-term dynamics of evolved planet systems involving stellar and planetary rotation and internal structure; and the proper evaluation of the observed data, taking the correlated noise of stellar and instrumental origin and the sampling function also into account. We highlight how a successful exomoon observation and the interpretations of the expected further measurements prove to be among the most complex and most interdisciplinary questions in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>How do wavelength correlations affect transmission spectra? Application of a new fast and flexible 2D Gaussian process framework to transiting exoplanet spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) is a common approach to account for correlated noise in exoplanet time series, particularly for transmission and emission spectroscopy. This analysis has typically been performed for each wavelength channel separately, with the retrieved uncertainties in the transmission spectrum assumed to be independent. However, the presence of noise correlated in wavelength could cause these uncertainties to be correlated, which could significantly affect the results of atmospheric retrievals. We present a method that uses a GP to model noise correlated in both wavelength and time simultaneously for the full spectroscopic dataset while avoiding the use of a 'common-mode' correction. To make this analysis computationally tractable, we introduce a new fast and flexible GP method that can analyse 2D datasets when the input points lie on a (potentially non-uniform) 2D grid - in our case a time by wavelength grid - and the kernel function has a Kronecker product structure. This simultaneously fits all light curves and enables the retrieval of the covariance matrix of the transmission spectrum. By testing on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our new approach can reliably recover atmospheric features contaminated by noise correlated in time and wavelength. In contrast, fitting each spectroscopic light curve separately performed poorly when wavelength-correlated noise was present. It frequently underestimated the uncertainty of the scattering slope and overestimated the uncertainty in the strength of sharp absorption peaks in transmission spectra. Two archival VLT/FORS2 transit observations of WASP-31b were re-analysed, with our method strongly constraining the presence of wavelength-correlated noise in both datasets and recovering significantly different constraints on atmospheric features such as the scattering slope and strength of sodium and potassium features.</description>

      <title>The Binary Broadening Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extended formalism for the spectral broadening function (BF) based on the multiplication rule of block matrices. The formalism, which we named the binary broadening function (BBF), can produce decomposed BFs for individual components of a binary star system by using two spectral templates. The decomposed BFs can be used to derive precise rotational profiles and radial velocities for individual components. We test the BBF on simulated spectra and actual observational spectra to show that the method is feasible on spectroscopic binaries, even when the spectral lines of two stellar components are heavily blended. To demonstrate the capability of the method, we conduct a simulation of `sketching' (imaging) a transiting circumbinary exoplanet using the BBF. We also discuss issues of implementation such as the variation of BBF with biased templates, the pros and cons of BBF, and cases when the method is not applicable.</description>
