      <title>Hydrodynamic fields in fluctuating environment: the emergent phononic and tachyonic-like excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using functional methods, we investigate in a low-temperature liquid, the sound quanta defined by the quantized hydrodynamic fields, under the effects of high-energy processes on the atomic/molecular scale. To obtain in the molecular level the excitation spectra of liquids, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive delta-correlated in space and time quantum noise field. The hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation fuctions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, named configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. Each term of the series describes in the liquid the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual gapless phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momenta space, i.e., tachyonic-like excitations. Furthermore, the Fourier representation of the two-point correlation functions of the model with the contribution coming from all phononic and tachyonic-like fields is presented. Finally, our analysis reveals that the emergent tachyonic-like and phononic excitations yield a distinctive thermodynamic signature - a quadratic temperature dependence of specific heat ($C_V \propto T^2$) at low temperatures, providing a theoretical foundation for experiments in confined and supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Density of states and non-smooth Lyapunov exponent in the localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of wave functions in the disordered models can be characterized by the Lyapunov exponent, which is zero in the extended phase and nonzero in the localized phase. Previous studies have shown that this exponent is a smooth function of eigenenergy in the same phase, thus its non-smoothness can serve as strong evidence to determine the phase transition from the extended phase to the localized phase. However, logically, there is no fundamental reason that prohibits this Lyapunov exponent from being non-smooth in the localized phase. In this work, we show that if the localization centers are inhomogeneous in the whole chain and if the system possesses (at least) two different localization modes, the Lyapunov exponent can become non-smooth in the localized phase at the boundaries between the different localization modes. We demonstrate these results using several slowly varying models and show that the singularities of density of states are essential to these non-smoothness, according to the Thouless formula. These results can be generalized to higher-dimensional models, suggesting the possible delicate structures in the localized phase, which can revise our understanding of localization hence greatly advance our comprehension of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Ultradense Sphere Packings Derived From Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings are an emerging class of exotic amorphous two-phase materials endowed with novel physical properties. Such packings of identical spheres have been created from SHU point patterns via a modified collective-coordinate optimization scheme that includes a soft-core repulsion, besides the standard `stealthy' pair potential. Using the distributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find that when the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal values of $\phi$, denoted by $\phi_{\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the particle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By contrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large $\phi_{\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$ in the zero-$\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at $\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for $\phi_{\max}$ as functions of $\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our soft-core SHU packings for small $\chi$ become configurationally very close to the jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as measured by the pair statistics. As $\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the packings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting structure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that soft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range correlations in the SHU ground states. We also compute the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$, which can be used to estimate various physical properties (e.g., electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean survival time) of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for discovering novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with unprecedentedly high density.</description>

      <title>Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Liang Information Flow Probe of Causality across Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating causation in the quantum domain is crucial. Despite numerous studies of correlations in quantum many-body systems, causation, which is very distinct from correlations, has hardly been studied. We address this by demonstrating the efficacy of the newly established causation measure, quantum Liang information flow, in quantifying causality across phase diagrams of quantum many-body systems. We focus on quantum criticality, which are highly nonclassical points. We extract causation behavior across a spectrum-wide critical point and a ground state second-order phase transition in both integrable and nonintegrable systems. Across criticality, each case exhibits distinct hallmarks, different from correlation measures. We also deduce that quantum causation qualitatively follows the quasiparticle picture of information propagation in integrable systems but exhibits enhanced quantum nonlocality near criticality. At times significantly larger than the spatial separation, it extracts additional features from the equilibrium wave function, leading to a peak just before the critical point for near boundary sites.</description>

      <title>Discover physical concepts and equations with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from the other is available. However, these two aspects are often intertwined and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across various physical systems. We apply the model to several examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentrism, Newton's law of gravity, Schr\"odinger's wave mechanics, and Pauli's spin-magnetic formulation. The results demonstrate that the correct physical theories can emerge in the neural network.</description>
