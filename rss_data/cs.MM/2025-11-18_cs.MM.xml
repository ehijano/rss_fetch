      <title>ProAV-DiT: A Projected Latent Diffusion Transformer for Efficient Synchronized Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sounding Video Generation (SVG) remains a challenging task due to the inherent structural misalignment between audio and video, as well as the high computational cost of multimodal data processing. In this paper, we introduce ProAV-DiT, a Projected Latent Diffusion Transformer designed for efficient and synchronized audio-video generation. To address structural inconsistencies, we preprocess raw audio into video-like representations, aligning both the temporal and spatial dimensions between audio and video. At its core, ProAV-DiT adopts a Multi-scale Dual-stream Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder (MDSA), which projects both modalities into a unified latent space using orthogonal decomposition, enabling fine-grained spatiotemporal modeling and semantic alignment. To further enhance temporal coherence and modality-specific fusion, we introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism, which consists of multi-scale temporal self-attention and group cross-modal attention. Furthermore, we stack the 2D latents from MDSA into a unified 3D latent space, which is processed by a spatio-temporal diffusion Transformer. This design efficiently models spatiotemporal dependencies, enabling the generation of high-fidelity synchronized audio-video content while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ProAV-DiT outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>SynthGuard: An Open Platform for Detecting AI-Generated Multimedia with Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made it possible for anyone to create images, audio, and video with unprecedented ease, enriching education, communication, and creative expression. At the same time, the rapid rise of AI-generated media has introduced serious risks, including misinformation, identity misuse, and the erosion of public trust as synthetic content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real media. Although deepfake detection has advanced, many existing tools remain closed-source, limited in modality, or lacking transparency and educational value, making it difficult for users to understand how detection decisions are made. To address these gaps, we introduce SynthGuard, an open, user-friendly platform for detecting and analyzing AI-generated multimedia using both traditional detectors and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SynthGuard provides explainable inference, unified image and audio support, and an interactive interface designed to make forensic analysis accessible to researchers, educators, and the public. The SynthGuard platform is available at: https://in-engr-nova.it.purdue.edu/</description>

      <title>Tactile Data Recording System for Clothing with Motion-Controlled Robotic Sliding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tactile sensation of clothing is critical to wearer comfort. To reveal physical properties that make clothing comfortable, systematic collection of tactile data during sliding motion is required. We propose a robotic arm-based system for collecting tactile data from intact garments. The system performs stroking measurements with a simulated fingertip while precisely controlling speed and direction, enabling creation of motion-labeled, multimodal tactile databases. Machine learning evaluation showed that including motion-related parameters improved identification accuracy for audio and acceleration data, demonstrating the efficacy of motion-related labels for characterizing clothing tactile sensation. This system provides a scalable, non-destructive method for capturing tactile data of clothing, contributing to future studies on fabric perception and reproduction.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Heisenberg Transform Capabilities in JPEG Compression Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the development and research of a new compression technology based on Weyl-Heisenberg bases (WH-technology) for modifying the JPEG compression standard and improving its characteristics. For this purpose, the paper analyzes the main stages of the JPEG compression algorithm, notes its key features and problems that limit further enhancement of its efficiency. To overcome these limitations, it is proposed to use the real version of the two-dimensional discrete orthogonal Weyl-Heisenberg transform (DWHT) instead of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the stage of transformation coding. This transformation, unlike DCT, initially has a block structure and is built on the basis of the Weyl-Heisenberg optimal signal basis, the functions of which are orthogonal and well localized both in the frequency and time domains. This feature of DWHT allows for more efficient decorrelation and compression of element values in each block of the image after transformation coding. As a result, it is possible to obtain more efficient selection and screening of insignificant elements at the subsequent stages of quantization and information coding. Based on DWHT, a new version of the JPEG compression algorithm was developed, and convenient criteria for evaluating the compression efficiency and metrics of quality losses were proposed. The results of an experimental study are presented, confirming the higher compression efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the JPEG compression standard.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning harmonizes distinct modalities by aligning them into a unified latent space. Recent research generalizes traditional cross-modal alignment to produce enhanced multimodal synergy but requires all modalities to be present for a common instance, making it challenging to utilize prevalent datasets with missing modalities. We provide theoretical insights into this issue from an anchor shift perspective. Observed modalities are aligned with a local anchor that deviates from the optimal one when all modalities are present, resulting in an inevitable shift. To address this, we propose CalMRL for multimodal representation learning to calibrate incomplete alignments caused by missing modalities. Specifically, CalMRL leverages the priors and the inherent connections among modalities to model the imputation for the missing ones at the representation level. To resolve the optimization dilemma, we employ a bi-step learning method with the closed-form solution of the posterior distribution of shared latents. We validate its mitigation of anchor shift and convergence with theoretical guidance. By equipping the calibrated alignment with the existing advanced method, we offer new flexibility to absorb data with missing modalities, which is originally unattainable. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the superiority of CalMRL. Our code, model checkpoints, and evaluation raw data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>To Align or Not to Align: Strategic Multimodal Representation Alignment for Optimal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12121v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning often relies on aligning representations across modalities to enable effective information integration, an approach traditionally assumed to be universally beneficial. However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Real-Time Low-Latency Music Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of deep learning for music demixing. However, there has been limited attention on real-time, low-latency music demixing, which holds potential for various applications, such as hearing aids, audio stream remixing, and live performances. Additionally, a notable tendency has emerged towards the development of larger models, limiting their applicability in certain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight real-time low-latency model called Real-Time Single-Path TFC-TDF UNET (RT-STT), which is based on the Dual-Path TFC-TDF UNET (DTTNet). In RT-STT, we propose a feature fusion technique based on channel expansion. We also demonstrate the superiority of single-path modeling over dual-path modeling in real-time models. Moreover, we investigate the method of quantization to further reduce inference time. RT-STT exhibits superior performance with significantly fewer parameters and shorter inference times compared to state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Moving Pictures of Thought: Extracting Visual Knowledge in Charles S. Peirce's Manuscripts with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources.</description>

      <title>Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Knowledge Graphs for Story Understanding in Visual Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the structured semantic understanding of visual narratives, using comics as a representative domain for multimodal storytelling. The framework organizes narrative content across three levels-panel, event, and macro-event, by integrating symbolic graphs that encode semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, it models visual elements such as characters, objects, and actions alongside textual components including dialogue and narration. These are systematically connected to higher-level graphs that capture narrative sequences and abstract story structures.
  Applied to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset, the framework supports interpretable symbolic reasoning across four representative tasks: action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character appearance mapping, and timeline reconstruction. Rather than prioritizing predictive performance, the system emphasizes transparency in narrative modeling and enables structured inference aligned with cognitive theories of event segmentation and visual storytelling. This work contributes to explainable narrative analysis and offers a foundation for authoring tools, narrative comprehension systems, and interactive media applications.</description>

      <title>Failures to Surface Harmful Contents in Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are increasingly deployed on numerous critical applications, where users rely on auto-generated summaries while casually skimming the video stream. We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.</description>

      <title>MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>DRAGON: Distributional Rewards Optimize Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modal encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference may be of a different modality (text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them with the reward function to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two finite sets to approximate distributional reward optimization. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. DRAGON is a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Demos at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment for Perceptual Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14475</link>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in https://sxfly99.github.io/FGResQ-Homepage.</description>

      <title>MusRec: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Rectified Flow and Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences. However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true zero-shot capability. leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, a zero-shot text-to-music editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.</description>
