      <title>Palladium-Coated Laterally Vibrating Resonators (LVRs) for Hydrogen Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel hydrogen sensor based on 30% scandium-doped aluminum nitride (ScAlN) laterally vibrating resonators (LVRs) functionalized with a palladium (Pd) thin film. The micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) device operates by detecting shifts in resonant frequency resulting from hydrogen absorption in the Pd layer. The sensor demonstrates a high mechanical quality factor (Qm) of 820, an electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt2) of 3.18%, and an enhanced responsivity of 26 Hz/ppm in the low-parts per million (ppm) range, making it highly suitable for hydrogen leak detection. Compared to existing MHz-range technologies, the sensor achieves up to 50x higher sensitivity, while also offering multi-frequency definition in a single lithographic step, minimal footprint, and the highest quality factor among comparable miniaturized platforms.</description>

      <title>Self-heating in SIS Mixers: Experimental Evidence and Theoretical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the relationship between self-heating and the characteristic features observed in the current-voltage characteristics (IVCs) of superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junctions. Finite-element analysis is employed to evaluate the steady-state temperature distribution around SIS junctions, explicitly accounting for the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivities of the constituent materials. This approach enables flexible estimation of self-heating under various practical conditions, such as different substrate materials, interfacial thermal resistances, and geometric layouts. A heating coefficient is extracted from the simulations and used as an input parameter for IVC modeling. Incorporating self-heating through temperature-dependent gap energy and quasiparticle broadening, the simulated IVCs reproduce bending features near the energy gap that agree with measured characteristics. Furthermore, when a weak link is present near an SIS junction, its critical current can be significantly reduced by junction heating, producing unexpected bends at the linear branch of measured IVCs. Conversely, such bends may serve as indicators that the junction temperature approaches the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>HEEPidermis: a versatile SoC for BioZ recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological impedance (BioZ) is an information-packed modality that allows for non-invasive monitoring of health and emotional state. Currently, most research involving tissue impedance is based on bulky or fixed-purpose hardware, which limits the scope of research and the possibilities of experiments. In this work, we present HEEPidermis: a System-on-Chip (SoC) which integrates all the blocks needed for tissue impedance measurement, including two 8-bit, arbitrary-signal current DACs, two VCO-based ADCs, and a RISC-V CPU to enable on-chip feature extraction for closed-loop operation. An event-based sub-sampler improves storage and energy efficiency for long-term recording. In addition to the versatile SoC, the digital back-end and behavioral models of the analog front-end are open-source, allowing fast system-level simulations or repurposing. The SoC was taped out on TSMC 65 nm LP process.</description>

      <title>Time Resolution Characterization of 4H-SiC LGADs with a ${}^{90}$Sr Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents timing measurements of 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (4H-SiC LGADs) using beta particles from a ${}^{90}$Sr source. The 4H-SiC LGADs exhibit fast signal responses, and a time resolution of 61~ps was achieved, comparable to that of standard Si LGADs. The present limitation in the time resolution of 4H-SiC LGADs appears to stem from limited charge generation. Nevertheless, their higher voltage tolerance and faster carrier drift suggest that, with increased charge collection, their timing performance could approach or even surpass that of Si LGADs. These results demonstrate the strong potential of 4H-SiC LGADs as a robust platform for precision timing in future 4D tracking detectors, while also highlighting that signal charge is the dominant factor currently limiting their performance, indicating that further optimization of gain and drift structures will be essential for future development.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Correcting Gain Jumps in TES Microcalorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of microcalorimeters based on transition-edge sensors (TESs) are being actively deployed to laboratories all over the world. A TES microcalorimeter array produces very large quantities of data and users of these devices have varying levels of experience, so it is important to provide robust software for data acquisition and analysis that can function with minimal user supervision. This software should be capable of addressing common phenomena that can adversely affect spectrum quality. Gain jumping is one such phenomenon that is characterized by abrupt changes in the gain of a device. Left unaddressed, gain jumps can degrade spectra by introducing false peaks. We are not aware of any previously published methods for resetting gain jumps during data acquisition or existing algorithms for correcting data that is degraded by gain jumps. We have developed automated methods for detecting and correcting gain jumps in gamma-ray TES microcalorimeters. We present a procedure for resetting gain jumps during a live data acquisition that involves briefly driving the TES into its normal state using the bias current. We also describe an algorithm for locating gain jumps and identifying unique gain states within existing microcalorimeter data. Finally, we provide a possible approach for correcting gain jumps after they have been identified.</description>

      <title>GEMINI: The First Underground Testbed for Seismic Isolation and Interplatform Control in Next-Generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GEMINI is an underground research and development facility dedicated to advancing seismic isolation and control technologies for future gravitational-wave observatories, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). This paper presents the technical design and theoretical framework of GEMINI's active seismic isolation platforms, including detailed noise budget analyses, performance predictions, and residual platform motion evaluations. The GEMINI platforms are designed to achieve unprecedented vibration isolation, targeting motion suppression across the 10 mHz to 10 Hz frequency band, and with the goal to make them the quietest platforms of their kind. In the context of ET, GEMINI will enable the development and validation of inter-platform control strategies essential for the stabilization of auxiliary degrees of freedom of its interferometers. GEMINI will also support the testing of cryogenic payloads and ultra-sensitive inertial sensors required for LGWA. By integrating advanced cryogenic systems, precision inertial sensors, and state-of-the-art vibration isolation technologies, GEMINI will serve as a versatile testbed for next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors and lunar seismometry missions.</description>

      <title>Preparation and measurement of an $\rm ^{37}$Ar source for liquid xenon detector calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the preparation and measurement of the radioactive isotope $\rm ^{37}Ar$, which was produced using thermal neutrons from a reactor, as a calibration source for liquid xenon time projection chambers. $\rm ^{37}Ar$ is a low-energy calibration source with a half-life of 35.01 days, making it suitable for calibration in the low-energy region of liquid xenon dark-matter experiments. Radioactive isotope $\rm ^{37}Ar$ was produced by irradiating $\rm ^{36}Ar$ with thermal neutrons. It was subsequently measured in a gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXe TPC) to validate its radioactivity. Our results demonstrate that $\rm ^{37}Ar$ is an effective and viable calibration source that offers precise calibration capabilities in the low-energy domain of xenon-based detectors.</description>

      <title>LEMURS dataset: Large-scale multi-detector ElectroMagnetic Universal Representation of Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LEMURS: an extensive dataset of simulated calorimeter showers designed to support the development and benchmarking of fast simulation methods in high-energy physics, most notably providing a step towards the development of foundation models. This new dataset is more robust than the well-established CaloChallenge dataset 2, featuring substantially greater statistics, a wider range of incident angles in the detector, and most crucially multiple detector geometries (including more realistic calorimeters). The dataset is provided in HDF5 format, with a file structure inspired by the CaloChallenge shower representation while also including more variables. LEMURS scale and diversity make it particularly suitable for development of foundation models and has been used in the CaloDiT-2 model, a pre-trained model released in the community standard simulation toolkit Geant4 (version 11.4.beta). All data and code for generation and analysis are openly accessible, facilitating reproducibility and reuse across the community.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Magnetic Evaporative Beamline Cooling for Preparation of Cold Atomic Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the endpoint of the beta spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular (T$_{2}$) tritium sources, at currents of at least 10$^{15}$ atoms per second. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and/or magnetic bottles for beta spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magneto-gravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique, and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.</description>

      <title>R&amp;D of KLM Upgrade for Direct Measurement of Neutral Hadron Momentum via Time-of-Flight in Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate momentum determination of a neutral hadron, such as a KL meson or a neutron, remains a significant challenge in particle physics and nuclear physics experiments. The Belle II experiment presents an opportunity to address this challenge through an upgrade incorporating Time-of-Flight (TOF) capability for its large KL and Muon Detector (KLM). We investigate the feasibility of momentum determination via TOF measurement. To achieve high time resolution for the KLM upgrade, we conduct research and development of cost-effective plastic scintillators in collaboration with GaoNengKeDi Company, and technology utilizing silicon photomultipliers(SiPMs) arrays. A bulk attenuation length of 120 \pm 7 cm has been achieved with a 135 cm-long sample, along with a time resolution of 70 \pm 7 ps at its midpoint. A 50 cm-long scintillator demonstrates an exceptional time resolution of 47 \pm 2 ps. These results highlight the potential of the proposed technology for improving neutral hadron momentum measurements in an upgraded Belle II KLM detector.</description>

      <title>The potential applications of muography to revealing sea shipwrecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon imaging, a non-invasive technique leveraging naturally occurring cosmic muons, has emerged as a promising tool for exploring underwater objects, including shipwrecks. This article examines the potential of muon imaging to investigate the contents of wrecked ships in the Baltic Sea and other marine environments. By analyzing the principles of muon tomography, its applications in underwater archaeology, and its advantages over traditional methods, we highlight its potential to reveal hidden details within shipwrecks while addressing challenges posed by the marine environment. These wrecks pose significant environmental risks due to their hazardous contents, such as explosives and crude oil products, making their detection and monitoring a matter of environmental and safety concern. Accurate modeling and imaging of such wrecks are therefore crucial for assessing potential dangers and mitigating environmental impacts. In this work, we adopted an approach similar to that used in underground muon experiments. Muon propagation through 50 meters of seawater was simulated using GEANT4, with muons transported to a depth of 35 meters and recorded in a virtual detector. The saved distributions of particle type, kinetic energy, interaction position, and angular directions were then used as tabulated input to the PrimaryGeneratorAction module. This approach enabled the generation of a realistic underwater muon flux over a 20 m x 20 m surface at 35 meters depth, which was subsequently employed to simulate different shipwreck filling scenarios. Assuming an exposure time of one week for a wreck located at a depth of 50 meters, our simulations demonstrate that muon imaging can resolve density contrasts sufficiently to distinguish between water, oil, and high-density materials, underscoring its feasibility as a practical tool for underwater hazard assessment.</description>
