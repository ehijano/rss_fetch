      <title>Differentially Private Federated Learning without Noise Addition: When is it Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) with Secure Aggregation (SA) has gained significant attention as a privacy preserving framework for training machine learning models while preventing the server from learning information about users' data from their individual encrypted model updates. Recent research has extended privacy guarantees of FL with SA by bounding the information leakage through the aggregate model over multiple training rounds thanks to leveraging the "noise" from other users' updates. However, the privacy metric used in that work (mutual information) measures the on-average privacy leakage, without providing any privacy guarantees for worse-case scenarios. To address this, in this work we study the conditions under which FL with SA can provide worst-case differential privacy guarantees. Specifically, we formally identify the necessary condition that SA can provide DP without addition noise. We then prove that when the randomness inside the aggregated model update is Gaussian with non-singular covariance matrix, SA can provide differential privacy guarantees with the level of privacy $\epsilon$ bounded by the reciprocal of the minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. However, we further demonstrate that in practice, these conditions are almost unlikely to hold and hence additional noise added in model updates is still required in order for SA in FL to achieve DP. Lastly, we discuss the potential solution of leveraging inherent randomness inside aggregated model update to reduce the amount of addition noise required for DP guarantee.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Data with Private Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need to analyze sensitive data, such as medical records or financial data, has created a critical research challenge in recent years. In this paper, we adopt the framework of differential privacy, and explore mechanisms for generating an entire dataset which accurately captures characteristics of the original data. We build upon the work of Boedihardjo et al, which laid the foundations for a new optimization-based algorithm for generating private synthetic data. Importantly, we adapt their algorithm by replacing a uniform sampling step with a private distribution estimator; this allows us to obtain better computational guarantees for discrete distributions, and develop a novel algorithm suitable for continuous distributions. We also explore applications of our work to several statistical tasks.</description>

      <title>Inferring Discussion Topics about Exploitation of Vulnerabilities from Underground Hacking Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of cyber threats necessitates proactive measures to identify vulnerabilities and potential exploits. Underground hacking forums serve as breeding grounds for the exchange of hacking techniques and discussions related to exploitation. In this research, we propose an innovative approach using topic modeling to analyze and uncover key themes in vulnerabilities discussed within these forums. The objective of our study is to develop a machine learning-based model that can automatically detect and classify vulnerability-related discussions in underground hacking forums. By monitoring and analyzing the content of these forums, we aim to identify emerging vulnerabilities, exploit techniques, and potential threat actors. To achieve this, we collect a large-scale dataset consisting of posts and threads from multiple underground forums. We preprocess and clean the data to ensure accuracy and reliability. Leveraging topic modeling techniques, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we uncover latent topics and their associated keywords within the dataset. This enables us to identify recurring themes and prevalent discussions related to vulnerabilities, exploits, and potential targets.</description>

      <title>Carbon Filter: Real-time Alert Triage Using Large Scale Clustering and Fast Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Alert fatigue" is one of the biggest challenges faced by the Security Operations Center (SOC) today, with analysts spending more than half of their time reviewing false alerts. Endpoint detection products raise alerts by pattern matching on event telemetry against behavioral rules that describe potentially malicious behavior, but can suffer from high false positives that distract from actual attacks. While alert triage techniques based on data provenance may show promise, these techniques can take over a minute to inspect a single alert, while EDR customers may face tens of millions of alerts per day; the current reality is that these approaches aren't nearly scalable enough for production environments.
  We present Carbon Filter, a statistical learning based system that dramatically reduces the number of alerts analysts need to manually review. Our approach is based on the observation that false alert triggers can be efficiently identified and separated from suspicious behaviors by examining the process initiation context (e.g., the command line) that launched the responsible process. Through the use of fast-search algorithms for training and inference, our approach scales to millions of alerts per day. Through batching queries to the model, we observe a theoretical maximum throughput of 20 million alerts per hour. Based on the analysis of tens of million alerts from customer deployments, our solution resulted in a 6-fold improvement in the Signal-to-Noise ratio without compromising on alert triage performance.</description>

      <title>Cryptanalysis of the SIMON Cypher Using Neo4j</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has seen the introduction of several Lightweight Encryption Algorithms (LEA). While LEAs are designed to enhance the integrity, privacy and security of data collected and transmitted by IoT devices, it is hazardous to assume that all LEAs are secure and exhibit similar levels of protection. To improve encryption strength, cryptanalysts and algorithm designers routinely probe LEAs using various cryptanalysis techniques to identify vulnerabilities and limitations of LEAs. Despite recent improvements in the efficiency of cryptanalysis utilising heuristic methods and a Partial Difference Distribution Table (PDDT), the process remains inefficient, with the random nature of the heuristic inhibiting reproducible results. However, the use of a PDDT presents opportunities to identify relationships between differentials utilising knowledge graphs, leading to the identification of efficient paths throughout the PDDT. This paper introduces the novel use of knowledge graphs to identify intricate relationships between differentials in the SIMON LEA, allowing for the identification of optimal paths throughout the differentials, and increasing the effectiveness of the differential security analyses of SIMON.</description>

      <title>AttacKG+:Boosting Attack Knowledge Graph Construction with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attack knowledge graph construction seeks to convert textual cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports into structured representations, portraying the evolutionary traces of cyber attacks. Even though previous research has proposed various methods to construct attack knowledge graphs, they generally suffer from limited generalization capability to diverse knowledge types as well as requirement of expertise in model design and tuning. Addressing these limitations, we seek to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), which have achieved enormous success in a broad range of tasks given exceptional capabilities in both language understanding and zero-shot task fulfillment. Thus, we propose a fully automatic LLM-based framework to construct attack knowledge graphs named: AttacKG+. Our framework consists of four consecutive modules: rewriter, parser, identifier, and summarizer, each of which is implemented by instruction prompting and in-context learning empowered by LLMs. Furthermore, we upgrade the existing attack knowledge schema and propose a comprehensive version. We represent a cyber attack as a temporally unfolding event, each temporal step of which encapsulates three layers of representation, including behavior graph, MITRE TTP labels, and state summary. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that: 1) our formulation seamlessly satisfies the information needs in threat event analysis, 2) our construction framework is effective in faithfully and accurately extracting the information defined by AttacKG+, and 3) our attack graph directly benefits downstream security practices such as attack reconstruction. All the code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Honeyfile Camouflage: Hiding Fake Files in Plain Sight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeyfiles are a particularly useful type of honeypot: fake files deployed to detect and infer information from malicious behaviour. This paper considers the challenge of naming honeyfiles so they are camouflaged when placed amongst real files in a file system. Based on cosine distances in semantic vector spaces, we develop two metrics for filename camouflage: one based on simple averaging and one on clustering with mixture fitting. We evaluate and compare the metrics, showing that both perform well on a publicly available GitHub software repository dataset.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Cyber Security: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities for leveraging artificial intelligence in various domains, including cybersecurity. As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats continue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of LLMs in cybersecurity (LLM4Security). By comprehensively collecting over 30K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 127 papers from top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic view of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the cybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings. First, we observe that LLMs are being applied to a wide range of cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, network intrusion detection, and phishing detection. Second, we find that the datasets used for training and evaluating LLMs in these tasks are often limited in size and diversity, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and representative datasets. Third, we identify several promising techniques for adapting LLMs to specific cybersecurity domains, such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain-specific pre-training. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities for future research in LLM4Security, including the need for more interpretable and explainable models, the importance of addressing data privacy and security concerns, and the potential for leveraging LLMs for proactive defense and threat hunting. Overall, our survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in LLM4Security and identifies several promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Blockchains for Internet of Things: Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) services necessitate the storage, transmission, and analysis of diverse data for inference, autonomy, and control. Blockchains, with their inherent properties of decentralization and security, offer efficient database solutions for these devices through consensus-based data sharing. However, it's essential to recognize that not every blockchain system is suitable for specific IoT applications, and some might be more beneficial when excluded with privacy concerns. For example, public blockchains are not suitable for storing sensitive data. This paper presents a detailed review of three distinct blockchains tailored for enhancing IoT applications. We initially delve into the foundational aspects of three blockchain systems, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implementation needs. Additionally, we discuss the security issues in different blockchains. Subsequently, we explore the blockchain's application in three pivotal IoT areas: edge AI, communications, and healthcare. We underscore potential challenges and the future directions for integrating different blockchains in IoT. Ultimately, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the synergies between blockchains and the IoT ecosystem, highlighting the opportunities and complexities involved.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Edge Cloud Computing: A Future Paradigm for IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding rapidly, which has created a need for sophisticated computational frameworks that can handle the data and security requirements inherent in modern IoT applications. However, traditional cloud computing frameworks have struggled with latency, scalability, and security vulnerabilities. Quantum-Edge Cloud Computing (QECC) is a new paradigm that effectively addresses these challenges by combining the computational power of quantum computing, the low-latency benefits of edge computing, and the scalable resources of cloud computing. This study has been conducted based on a published literature review, performance improvements, and metrics data from Bangladesh on smart city infrastructure, healthcare monitoring, and the industrial IoT sector. We have discussed the integration of quantum cryptography to enhance data integrity, the role of edge computing in reducing response times, and how cloud computing's resource abundance can support large IoT networks. We examine case studies, such as the use of quantum sensors in self-driving vehicles, to illustrate the real-world impact of QECC. Furthermore, the paper identifies future research directions, including developing quantum-resistant encryption and optimizing quantum algorithms for edge computing. The convergence of these technologies in QECC promises to overcome the existing limitations of IoT frameworks and set a new standard for the future of IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Explanation as a Watermark: Towards Harmless and Multi-bit Model Ownership Verification via Watermarking Feature Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ownership verification is currently the most critical and widely adopted post-hoc method to safeguard model copyright. In general, model owners exploit it to identify whether a given suspicious third-party model is stolen from them by examining whether it has particular properties `inherited' from their released models. Currently, backdoor-based model watermarks are the primary and cutting-edge methods to implant such properties in the released models. However, backdoor-based methods have two fatal drawbacks, including harmfulness and ambiguity. The former indicates that they introduce maliciously controllable misclassification behaviors ($i.e.$, backdoor) to the watermarked released models. The latter denotes that malicious users can easily pass the verification by finding other misclassified samples, leading to ownership ambiguity.
  In this paper, we argue that both limitations stem from the `zero-bit' nature of existing watermarking schemes, where they exploit the status ($i.e.$, misclassified) of predictions for verification. Motivated by this understanding, we design a new watermarking paradigm, $i.e.$, Explanation as a Watermark (EaaW), that implants verification behaviors into the explanation of feature attribution instead of model predictions. Specifically, EaaW embeds a `multi-bit' watermark into the feature attribution explanation of specific trigger samples without changing the original prediction. We correspondingly design the watermark embedding and extraction algorithms inspired by explainable artificial intelligence. In particular, our approach can be used for different tasks ($e.g.$, image classification and text generation). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and harmlessness of our EaaW and its resistance to potential attacks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Data Integrity and Traceability in Industry Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS) through Blockchain Technology: A Comprehensive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology, heralded as a transformative innovation, has far-reaching implications beyond its initial application in cryptocurrencies. This study explores the potential of blockchain in enhancing data integrity and traceability within Industry Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), a crucial aspect in the era of Industry 4.0. ICPS, integrating computational and physical components, is pivotal in managing critical infrastructure like manufacturing, power grids, and transportation networks. However, they face challenges in security, privacy, and reliability. With its inherent immutability, transparency, and distributed consensus, blockchain presents a groundbreaking approach to address these challenges. It ensures robust data reliability and traceability across ICPS, enhancing transaction transparency and facilitating secure data sharing. This research unearths various blockchain applications in ICPS, including supply chain management, quality control, contract management, and data sharing. Each application demonstrates blockchain's capacity to streamline processes, reduce fraud, and enhance system efficiency. In supply chain management, blockchain provides real-time auditing and compliance. For quality control, it establishes tamper-proof records, boosting consumer confidence. In contract management, smart contracts automate execution, enhancing efficiency. Blockchain also fosters secure collaboration in ICPS, which is crucial for system stability and safety. This study emphasizes the need for further research on blockchain's practical implementation in ICPS, focusing on challenges like scalability, system integration, and security vulnerabilities. It also suggests examining blockchain's economic and organizational impacts in ICPS to understand its feasibility and long-term advantages.</description>

      <title>Systematic review, analysis, and characterisation of malicious industrial network traffic datasets for aiding Machine Learning algorithm performance testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as a complementary technology to Operational Technology (OT) has enabled a new level of standardised data access and process visibility. This convergence of Information Technology (IT), OT, and IIoT has also created new cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks that must be managed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful tool to monitor OT/IIoT networks for malicious activity and is a highly active area of research. AI researchers are applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to the detection of anomalous or malicious activity in network traffic. They typically use datasets derived from IoT/IIoT/OT network traffic captures to measure the performance of their proposed approaches. Therefore, there is a widespread need for datasets for algorithm testing. This work systematically reviews publicly available network traffic capture-based datasets, including categorisation of contained attack types, review of metadata, and statistical as well as complexity analysis. Each dataset is analysed to provide researchers with metadata that can be used to select the best dataset for their research question. This results in an added benefit to the community as researchers can select the best dataset for their research more easily and according to their specific Machine Learning goals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) encompasses a nation's essential assets that are fundamental to the operation of society and the economy, ensuring the provision of vital utilities such as energy, water, transportation, and communication. Nevertheless, growing cybersecurity threats targeting these infrastructures can potentially interfere with operations and seriously risk national security and public safety. In this paper, we examine the intricate issues raised by cybersecurity risks to vital infrastructure, highlighting these systems' vulnerability to different types of cyberattacks. We analyse the significance of trust, privacy, and resilience for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), examining the diverse standards and regulations to manage these domains. We also scrutinise the co-analysis of safety and security, offering innovative approaches for their integration and emphasising the interdependence between these fields. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive method for CIP leveraging Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), giving a tailored lifecycle and discussing specific applications across different critical infrastructure sectors. Lastly, we discuss potential future directions that promise to enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructures. This paper proposes innovative strategies for CIP from evolving attacks and enhances comprehension of cybersecurity concerns related to critical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is more demanding nowadays and it can be achieved through deploying Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs) exchange traffic events. Malicious drivers generate false events. Thus, they need to be identified to maintain trustworthy communication. When an authorised user acts maliciously, the security scheme typically fails. However, a trust model can isolate false messages. In this paper, the significance of trustworthy announcements for VANETs is analysed. To this end, a series of experiments is conducted in Veins to illustrate how the trustworthiness of announcements affects travel time. A traffic scenario is created where vehicles detour to an alternate route with an announcement from the leading vehicle. Both true and false announcements are considered. Results confirm that false announcements and refraining from announcements increase travel time. However, the travel time is reduced with trustworthy announcements. From this analysis, it can be concluded that trustworthy announcements facilitate driver comfort.</description>

      <title>A trust management framework for vehicular ad hoc networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) enable road users and public infrastructure to share information that improves the operation of roads and driver experience. However, these are vulnerable to poorly behaved authorized users. Trust management is used to address attacks from authorized users in accordance with their trust score. By removing the dissemination of trust metrics in the validation process, communication overhead and response time are lowered. In this paper, we propose a new Tamper-Proof Device (TPD) based trust management framework for controlling trust at the sender side vehicle that regulates driver behaviour. Moreover, the dissemination of feedback is only required when there is conflicting information in the VANET. If a conflict arises, the Road-Side Unit (RSU) decides, using the weighted voting system, whether the originator is to be believed, or not. The framework is evaluated against a centralized reputation approach and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the latter.</description>

      <title>A fuzzy reward and punishment scheme for vehicular ad hoc networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust management is an important security approach for the successful implementation of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Trust models evaluate messages to assign reward or punishment. This can be used to influence a driver's future behaviour. In the author's previous work, a sender side based trust management framework is developed which avoids the receiver evaluation of messages. However, this does not guarantee that a trusted driver will not lie. These "untrue attacks" are resolved by the RSUs using collaboration to rule on a dispute, providing a fixed amount of reward and punishment. The lack of sophistication is addressed in this paper with a novel fuzzy RSU controller considering the severity of incident, driver past behaviour, and RSU confidence to determine the reward or punishment for the conflicted drivers. Although any driver can lie in any situation, it is expected that trustworthy drivers are more likely to remain so, and vice versa. This behaviour is captured in a Markov chain model for sender and reporter drivers where their lying characteristics depend on trust score and trust state. Each trust state defines the driver's likelihood of lying using different probability distribution. An extensive simulation is performed to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy assessment and examine the Markov chain driver behaviour model with changing the initial trust score of all or some drivers in Veins simulator. The fuzzy and the fixed RSU assessment schemes are compared, and the result shows that the fuzzy scheme can encourage drivers to improve their behaviour.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Threats to Automatic Modulation Open Set Recognition in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Open Set Recognition (AMOSR) is a crucial technological approach for cognitive radio communications, wireless spectrum management, and interference monitoring within wireless networks. Numerous studies have shown that AMR is highly susceptible to minimal perturbations carefully designed by malicious attackers, leading to misclassification of signals. However, the adversarial security issue of AMOSR has not yet been explored. This paper adopts the perspective of attackers and proposes an Open Set Adversarial Attack (OSAttack), aiming at investigating the adversarial vulnerabilities of various AMOSR methods. Initially, an adversarial threat model for AMOSR scenarios is established. Subsequently, by analyzing the decision criteria of both discriminative and generative open set recognition, OSFGSM and OSPGD are proposed to reduce the performance of AMOSR. Finally, the influence of OSAttack on AMOSR is evaluated utilizing a range of qualitative and quantitative indicators. The results indicate that despite the increased resistance of AMOSR models to conventional interference signals, they remain vulnerable to attacks by adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>HackCar: a test platform for attacks and defenses on a cost-contained automotive architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the design of HackCar, a testing platform for replicating attacks and defenses on a generic automotive system without requiring access to a complete vehicle. This platform empowers security researchers to illustrate the consequences of attacks targeting an automotive system on a realistic platform, facilitating the development and testing of security countermeasures against both existing and novel attacks. The HackCar platform is built upon an F1-10th model, to which various automotive-grade microcontrollers are connected through automotive communication protocols. This solution is crafted to be entirely modular, allowing for the creation of diverse test scenarios. Researchers and practitioners can thus develop innovative security solutions while adhering to the constraints of automotive-grade microcontrollers. We showcase our design by comparing it with a real, licensed, and unmodified vehicle. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of the HackCar in both an attack-free scenario and a scenario where an attack on in-vehicle communication is deployed.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner Basis Cryptanalysis of Ciminion and Hydra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ciminion and Hydra are two recently introduced symmetric key Pseudo-Random Functions for Multi-Party Computation applications. For efficiency both primitives utilize quadratic permutations at round level. Therefore, polynomial system solving-based attacks pose a serious threat to these primitives. For Ciminion we construct a quadratic degree reverse lexicographic (DRL) Gr\"obner basis for the iterated polynomial model via affine transformations. For Hydra we provide a computer-aided proof in SageMath that a quadratic DRL Gr\"obner basis is already contained within the iterated polynomial system for the Hydra heads after affine transformations and a linear change of coordinates.
  Our Ciminion DRL Gr\"obner basis simplifies cryptanalysis, since one does not need to impose genericity assumptions, like being regular or semi-regular, anymore to derive complexity estimates on key recovery attacks.
  In the Hydra proposal it was claimed that $r_\mathcal{H} = 31$ rounds for the heads are sufficient to achieve $128$ bits of security against Gr\"obner basis attacks for key recovery. However, for $r_\mathcal{H} = 31$ standard term order conversion to a lexicographic (LEX) Gr\"obner basis for our Hydra DRL Gr\"obner basis requires just $126$ bits. Moreover, via the Eigenvalue Method up to $r_\mathcal{H} = 33$ rounds can be attacked below $128$ bits.</description>

      <title>(In)Security of Mobile Apps in Developing Countries: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In developing countries, several key sectors, including education, finance, agriculture, and healthcare, mainly deliver their services via mobile app technology on handheld devices. As a result, mobile app security has emerged as a paramount issue in developing countries. In this paper, we investigate the state of research on mobile app security, focusing on developing countries. More specifically, we performed a systematic literature review exploring the research directions taken by existing works, the different security concerns addressed, and the techniques used by researchers to highlight or address app security issues. Our main findings are: (1) the literature includes only a few studies on mobile app security in the context of developing countries ; (2) among the different security concerns that researchers study, vulnerability detection appears to be the leading research topic; (3) FinTech apps are revealed as the main target in the relevant literature. Overall, our work highlights that there is largely room for developing further specialized techniques addressing mobile app security in the context of developing countries.</description>

      <title>Air Gap: Protecting Privacy-Conscious Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents to manage sensitive user data raises significant privacy concerns. While these agents excel at understanding and acting on context, this capability can be exploited by malicious actors. We introduce a novel threat model where adversarial third-party apps manipulate the context of interaction to trick LLM-based agents into revealing private information not relevant to the task at hand.
  Grounded in the framework of contextual integrity, we introduce AirGapAgent, a privacy-conscious agent designed to prevent unintended data leakage by restricting the agent's access to only the data necessary for a specific task. Extensive experiments using Gemini, GPT, and Mistral models as agents validate our approach's effectiveness in mitigating this form of context hijacking while maintaining core agent functionality. For example, we show that a single-query context hijacking attack on a Gemini Ultra agent reduces its ability to protect user data from 94% to 45%, while an AirGapAgent achieves 97% protection, rendering the same attack ineffective.</description>

      <title>Systematic Use of Random Self-Reducibility against Physical Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel, black-box software-based countermeasure against physical attacks including power side-channel and fault-injection attacks. The approach uses the concept of random self-reducibility and self-correctness to add randomness and redundancy in the execution for protection. Our approach is at the operation level, is not algorithm-specific, and thus, can be applied for protecting a wide range of algorithms. The countermeasure is empirically evaluated against attacks over operations like modular exponentiation, modular multiplication, polynomial multiplication, and number theoretic transforms. An end-to-end implementation of this countermeasure is demonstrated for RSA-CRT signature algorithm and Kyber Key Generation public key cryptosystems. The countermeasure reduced the power side-channel leakage by two orders of magnitude, to an acceptably secure level in TVLA analysis. For fault injection, the countermeasure reduces the number of faults to 95.4% in average.</description>

      <title>SINBAD: Saliency-informed detection of breakage caused by ad blocking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-enhancing blocking tools based on filter-list rules tend to break legitimate functionality. Filter-list maintainers could benefit from automated breakage detection tools that allow them to proactively fix problematic rules before deploying them to millions of users. We introduce SINBAD, an automated breakage detector that improves the accuracy over the state of the art by 20%, and is the first to detect dynamic breakage and breakage caused by style-oriented filter rules. The success of SINBAD is rooted in three innovations: (1) the use of user-reported breakage issues in forums that enable the creation of a high-quality dataset for training in which only breakage that users perceive as an issue is included; (2) the use of 'web saliency' to automatically identify user-relevant regions of a website on which to prioritize automated interactions aimed at triggering breakage; and (3) the analysis of webpages via subtrees which enables fine-grained identification of problematic filter rules.</description>

      <title>Nearly-Optimal Consensus Tolerating Adaptive Omissions: Why is a Lot of Randomness is Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of reaching agreement in a synchronous distributed system by $n$ autonomous parties, when the communication links from/to faulty parties can omit messages. The faulty parties are selected and controlled by an adaptive, full-information, computationally unbounded adversary. We design a randomized algorithm that works in $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$ rounds and sends $O(n^2\log^3 n)$ communication bits, where the number of faulty parties is $\Theta(n)$. Our result is simultaneously tight for both these measures within polylogarithmic factors: due to the $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on communication by Abraham et al. (PODC'19) and $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ lower bound on the number of rounds by Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or (PODC'98). We also quantify how much randomness is necessary and sufficient to reduce time complexity to a certain value, while keeping the communication complexity (nearly) optimal. We prove that no MC algorithm can work in less than $\Omega(\frac{n^2}{\max\{R,n\}\log n})$ rounds if it uses less than $O(R)$ calls to a random source, assuming a constant fraction of faulty parties. This can be contrasted with a long line of work on consensus against an {\em adversary limited to polynomial computation time}, thus unable to break cryptographic primitives, culminating in a work by Ghinea et al. (EUROCRYPT'22), where an optimal $O(r)$-round solution with probability $1-(cr)^{-r}$ is given. Our lower bound strictly separates these two regimes, by excluding such results if the adversary is computationally unbounded. On the upper bound side, we show that for $R\in\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ there exists an algorithm solving consensus in $\tilde{O}(\frac{n^2}{R})$ rounds with high probability, where tilde notation hides a polylogarithmic factor. The communication complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the amount of randomness $R$ and stays optimal within polylogarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure Virtual Elections: Multiparty Computation of Order Based Voting Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10580v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic voting systems are essential for holding virtual elections, and the need for such systems increases due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing that it mandates. One of the main challenges in e-voting systems is to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are consistent with the cast ballots, and that the privacy of the voters is preserved. We propose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot secrecy, in the sense that it issues only the required output, while no other information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, which is achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the voters' confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol's computational costs establishes that it is lightweight and can be readily implemented in real-life electronic elections.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on CVSS Scoring Inconsistencies: A User-Centric Study on Evaluating Widespread Security Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a popular method for evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities in vulnerability management. In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the "2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses" list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security of model parameters and user data is critical for Transformer-based services, such as ChatGPT. While recent strides in secure two-party protocols have successfully addressed security concerns in serving Transformer models, their adoption is practically infeasible due to the prohibitive cryptographic overheads involved. Drawing insights from our hands-on experience in developing two real-world Transformer-based services, we identify the inherent efficiency bottleneck in the two-party assumption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel three-party threat model. Within this framework, we design a semi-symmetric permutation-based protection scheme and present STIP, the first secure Transformer inference protocol without any inference accuracy loss. Experiments on representative Transformer models in real systems show that STIP has practical security and outperforms state-of-the-art secure two-party protocols in efficiency by millions of times.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Difficulty Calibration for Enhanced Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, are currently an integral part of various applications, from healthcare to finance. However, using sensitive data to train these models raises concerns about privacy and security. One method that has emerged to verify if the trained models are privacy-preserving is Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which allows adversaries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's training dataset. While a series of MIAs have been proposed in the literature, only a few can achieve high True Positive Rates (TPR) in the low False Positive Rate (FPR) region (0.01%~1%). This is a crucial factor to consider for an MIA to be practically useful in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a novel approach to MIA that is aimed at significantly improving TPR at low FPRs. Our method, named learning-based difficulty calibration for MIA(LDC-MIA), characterizes data records by their hardness levels using a neural network classifier to determine membership. The experiment results show that LDC-MIA can improve TPR at low FPR by up to 4x compared to the other difficulty calibration based MIAs. It also has the highest Area Under ROC curve (AUC) across all datasets. Our method's cost is comparable with most of the existing MIAs, but is orders of magnitude more efficient than one of the state-of-the-art methods, LiRA, while achieving similar performance.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Network-based Block Propagation with Optimal AoI and Reputation in Web 3.0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web 3.0 is recognized as a pioneering paradigm that empowers users to securely oversee data without reliance on a centralized authority. Blockchains, as a core technology to realize Web 3.0, can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management. Nevertheless, the evolution of blockchain-enabled Web 3.0 is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as ensuring efficiency and reliability to enhance block propagation performance. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based reliable block propagation optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Web 3.0. We first innovatively apply a data-freshness metric called age of block to measure block propagation efficiency in public blockchains. To achieve the reliability of block propagation, we introduce a reputation mechanism based on the subjective logic model, including the local and recommended opinions to calculate the miner reputation value. Moreover, considering that the GAT possesses the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT with reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal block propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding block propagation efficiency and reliability compared with traditional routing mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Underwater datacenters (UDCs) hold promise as next-generation data storage due to their energy efficiency and environmental sustainability benefits. While the natural cooling properties of water save power, the isolated aquatic environment and long-range sound propagation in water create unique vulnerabilities which differ from those of on-land data centers. Our research discovers the unique vulnerabilities of fault-tolerant storage devices, resource allocation software, and distributed file systems to acoustic injection attacks in UDCs. With a realistic testbed approximating UDC server operations, we empirically characterize the capabilities of acoustic injection underwater and find that an attacker can reduce fault-tolerant RAID 5 storage system throughput by 17% up to 100%. Our closed-water analyses reveal that attackers can (i) cause unresponsiveness and automatic node removal in a distributed filesystem with only 2.4 minutes of sustained acoustic injection, (ii) induce a distributed database's latency to increase by up to 92.7% to reduce system reliability, and (iii) induce load-balance managers to redirect up to 74% of resources to a target server to cause overload or force resource colocation. Furthermore, we perform open-water experiments in a lake and find that an attacker can cause controlled throughput degradation at a maximum allowable distance of 6.35 m using a commercial speaker. We also investigate and discuss the effectiveness of standard defenses against acoustic injection attacks. Finally, we formulate a novel machine learning-based detection system that reaches 0% False Positive Rate and 98.2% True Positive Rate trained on our dataset of profiled hard disk drives under 30-second FIO benchmark execution. With this work, we aim to help manufacturers proactively protect UDCs against acoustic injection attacks and ensure the security of subsea computing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Large pretrained language models (LLMs) have shown surprising In-Context Learning (ICL) ability. An important application in deploying large language models is to augment LLMs with a private database for some specific task. The main problem with this promising commercial use is that LLMs have been shown to memorize their training data and their prompt data are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) and prompt leaking attacks. In order to deal with this problem, we treat LLMs as untrusted in privacy and propose a locally differentially private framework of in-context learning(LDP-ICL) in the settings where labels are sensitive. Considering the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers by gradient descent, we provide an analysis of the trade-off between privacy and utility in such LDP-ICL for classification. Moreover, we apply LDP-ICL to the discrete distribution estimation problem. In the end, we perform several experiments to demonstrate our analysis results.</description>

      <title>SmmPack: Obfuscation for SMM Modules with TPM Sealed Key</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: System Management Mode (SMM) is the highest-privileged operating mode of x86 and x86-64 processors. Through SMM exploitation, attackers can tamper with the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware, disabling the security mechanisms implemented by the operating system and hypervisor. Vulnerabilities enabling SMM code execution are often reported as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs); however, no security mechanisms currently exist to prevent attackers from analyzing those vulnerabilities. To increase the cost of vulnerability analysis of SMM modules, we introduced SmmPack. The core concept of SmmPack involves encrypting an SMM module with the key securely stored in a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). We assessed the effectiveness of SmmPack in preventing attackers from obtaining and analyzing SMM modules using various acquisition methods. Our results show that SmmPack significantly increases the cost by narrowing down the means of module acquisition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SmmPack operates without compromising the performance of the original SMM modules. We also clarified the management and adoption methods of SmmPack, as well as the procedure for applying BIOS updates, and demonstrated that the implementation of SmmPack is realistic.</description>

      <title>One-Wayness in Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of one-way functions is one of the most fundamental assumptions in classical cryptography. In the quantum world, on the other hand, there are evidences that some cryptographic primitives can exist even if one-way functions do not exist. We therefore have the following important open problem in quantum cryptography: What is the most fundamental element in quantum cryptography? In this direction, Brakerski, Canetti, and Qian recently defined a notion called EFI pairs, which are pairs of efficiently generatable states that are statistically distinguishable but computationally indistinguishable, and showed its equivalence with some cryptographic primitives including commitments, oblivious transfer, and general multi-party computations. However, their work focuses on decision-type primitives and does not cover search-type primitives like quantum money and digital signatures. In this paper, we study properties of one-way state generators (OWSGs), which are a quantum analogue of one-way functions. We first revisit the definition of OWSGs and generalize it by allowing mixed output states. Then we show the following results. (1) We define a weaker version of OWSGs, weak OWSGs, and show that they are equivalent to OWSGs. (2) Quantum digital signatures are equivalent to OWSGs. (3) Private-key quantum money schemes (with pure money states) imply OWSGs. (4) Quantum pseudo one-time pad schemes imply both OWSGs and EFI pairs. (5) We introduce an incomparable variant of OWSGs, which we call secretly-verifiable and statistically-invertible OWSGs, and show that they are equivalent to EFI pairs.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Linear Regression with Linked Data</title>

Abstract: There has been increasing demand for establishing privacy-preserving methodologies for modern statistics and machine learning. Differential privacy, a mathematical notion from computer science, is a rising tool offering robust privacy guarantees. Recent work focuses primarily on developing differentially private versions of individual statistical and machine learning tasks, with nontrivial upstream pre-processing typically not incorporated. An important example is when record linkage is done prior to downstream modeling. Record linkage refers to the statistical task of linking two or more data sets of the same group of entities without a unique identifier. This probabilistic procedure brings additional uncertainty to the subsequent task. In this paper, we present two differentially private algorithms for linear regression with linked data. In particular, we propose a noisy gradient method and a sufficient statistics perturbation approach for the estimation of regression coefficients. We investigate the privacy-accuracy tradeoff by providing finite-sample error bounds for the estimators, which allows us to understand the relative contributions of linkage error, estimation error, and the cost of privacy. The variances of the estimators are also discussed. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulations and an application to synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Correlated Noise Provably Beats Independent Noise for Differentially Private Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private learning algorithms inject noise into the learning process. While the most common private learning algorithm, DP-SGD, adds independent Gaussian noise in each iteration, recent work on matrix factorization mechanisms has shown empirically that introducing correlations in the noise can greatly improve their utility. We characterize the asymptotic learning utility for any choice of the correlation function, giving precise analytical bounds for linear regression and as the solution to a convex program for general convex functions. We show, using these bounds, how correlated noise provably improves upon vanilla DP-SGD as a function of problem parameters such as the effective dimension and condition number. Moreover, our analytical expression for the near-optimal correlation function circumvents the cubic complexity of the semi-definite program used to optimize the noise correlation matrix in previous work. We validate our theory with experiments on private deep learning. Our work matches or outperforms prior work while being efficient both in terms of compute and memory.</description>

      <title>Espresso: Robust Concept Filtering in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models generate high-fidelity images for given textual prompts. They are trained on large datasets scraped from the Internet, potentially containing unacceptable concepts (e.g., copyright infringing or unsafe). Retraining T2I models after filtering out unacceptable concepts in the training data is inefficient and degrades utility. Hence, there is a need for concept removal techniques (CRTs) which are effective in removing unacceptable concepts, utility-preserving on acceptable concepts, and robust against evasion with adversarial prompts. None of the prior filtering and fine-tuning CRTs satisfy all these requirements simultaneously.
  We introduce Espresso, the first robust concept filter based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). It identifies unacceptable concepts by projecting the generated image's embedding onto the vector connecting unacceptable and acceptable concepts in the joint text-image embedding space. This ensures robustness by restricting the adversary to adding noise only along this vector, in the direction of the acceptable concept. Further fine-tuning Espresso to separate embeddings of acceptable and unacceptable concepts, while preserving their pairing with image embeddings, ensures both effectiveness and utility. We evaluate Espresso on eleven concepts to show that it is effective (~5% CLIP accuracy on unacceptable concepts), utility-preserving (~93% normalized CLIP score on acceptable concepts), and robust (~4% CLIP accuracy on adversarial prompts for unacceptable concepts). Finally, we present theoretical bounds for the certified robustness of Espresso against adversarial prompts, and an empirical analysis.</description>
