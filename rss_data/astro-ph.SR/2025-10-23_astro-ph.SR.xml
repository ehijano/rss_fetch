      <title>A comprehensive grid of massive binary evolution models for the Galaxy - Surface properties of post-mass transfer stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars often evolve in binary systems, in which binary interactions significantly affect their evolution. Massive stars in the Galaxy serve as valuable testbeds for this due to their proximity. We computed the evolution of more than 38000 galactic binary systems with initial primary star masses of 5...100 Msun. In this paper, we aim to investigate the surface properties of post-mass transfer mass donor and mass gainer stars through core hydrogen burning, core helium burning, and for the pre-supernova stage. The models are computed with MESA, incorporating detailed stellar and binary physics, including internal differential rotation, magnetic angular momentum transport, mass-dependent overshooting, stellar wind mass-loss, mass and angular momentum transfer and tidal interaction. They incorporate a new extensive nuclear network for hydrogen burning, which allows us to track the full range of hydrogen burning nucleosynthesis products, from the light elements to aluminum. The widest, non-interacting binary models in our grid effectively serve as single star models. We find that mass gainers and mass donors may evolve through long-lived blue and yellow supergiant stages during core helium burning where single stars of the same mass remain red supergiants. Furthermore, some of our gainers evolve into more luminous yellow and blue supergiants prior to core collapse than single stars, while some donors end their life as red or yellow supergiants, showing a rich diversity in supernova progenitors. We show that the surface elemental and isotopic abundances carry valuable information about a star's evolutionary history and can be used to distinguish binary interaction products from single stars. Our binary model grid may serve as a tool for identifying post-mass transfer stars and supernovae, and holds potential for population studies, supernova modeling, and guidance of future observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux cancellation in the solar atmosphere through 3D realistic numerical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulation of a magnetic cancellation event. The model is calculated with the Bifrost code and spans from the uppermost convection zone to the corona. The cancellation occurs between the positive polarity of an emerged magnetic bipole and a preexisting negative polarity. We try both to understand the RMHD aspects as well as to carry out comparison to observations, in part via spectral synthesis of optically thick photospheric and chromospheric lines using the RH1.5D code, and optically thin coronal ones. The reconnection between the opposite flux systems takes place at chromospheric heights through a quasi-separatrix layer without null points. Sharp V-shaped upward-moving field lines and highly warped downward-moving post-reconnection loops are created. The chromospheric reconnection is in full swing when the colliding magnetic patches are still separated by a granular cell at the photosphere. In a later phase, photospheric cancellation takes place with submergence of the closed magnetic loops linking the opposite polarities. We carry out comparisons with the observations of the photospheric magnetic flux loss rates, as well as of the horizontal magnetic field and vertical velocity at the polarity inversion line. The reconnection outflows cause intensity brightenings, jets and different spectral features in the synthesized chromospheric spectral lines, strongly reminiscent of those found in recent observations. Coherent, twisted magnetic flux ropes are created by the flows associated with the process. Including coronal levels is crucial for proper modeling, even if no major ejection or brightening is produced in the corona in this event.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 79 $\delta$ Scuti Stars in NGC 3532 Suggests a Decrease of Pulsator Occurrence with Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many A-F type stars do not display $\delta$ Scuti pulsations, despite being located within the instability strip. Open clusters provide a unique opportunity to study $\delta$ Scuti pulsations among coeval populations with uniform chemical composition. Here we use data from the TESS Mission to discover 79 $\delta$ Scuti pulsators in the 300 Myr old open cluster NGC 3532, the largest number found within a single open cluster to-date. We report a $50\pm5\%$ pulsator fraction in NGC 3532, considerably lower than in younger stellar populations, such the Pleiades (110 Myr), NGC 2516 (100 Myr), and the Cep-Her Complex ($\leq\,$80 Myr), and similar to the pulsator fraction found among field star samples. We introduce the concept of pulsator occurrence, which corrects for incompleteness, and find it to be $63\pm6\%$. For the stars that do pulsate, we find that the hotter stars occupy a distinct branch in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) due to faster rotation ($&gt;\,$150 km/s) than their non-pulsating counterparts. These results suggest that pulsator occurrence decreases with age and that rapid rotation is important in maintaining $\delta$ Scuti pulsations over time. We also investigate the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relation and the $\nu_{\rm max}$--$T_{\rm eff}$ relation of $\delta$ Scuti stars in NGC 3532. We find much scatter in the P-L relation of the dominant mode and two distinct branches in the $\nu_{\rm max}$--$T_{\rm eff}$ relation, similar to the Cep-Her Complex.</description>

      <title>The impact of stellar winds and tidal locking effects on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets around M dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an assessment of the effects of stellar wind magnetic and mechanical components on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting the inner and outer radii of the habitable zone (HZ) of M dwarfs. We consider stars with masses in the range of $0.09 - 0.75 M_\odot$ and planets with a surface dipolar magnetic field of 0.5 G. We estimate the size of the magnetospheres of such exoplanets using the pressure balance equation including the contribution of magnetic and ram pressures from stellar winds. We explore different scenarios, including fast and slow stellar winds, to assess the relevance of kinetic contribution. Furthermore, the effect of tidal locking and potential deviations from the Parker spiral, typically used to describe the interplanetary magnetic field, are analyzed. We show that for low mass stars ($M &lt; 0.15 M_\odot$), the ram pressure exerted by stellar winds affects the size of the magnetosphere more than the stellar wind magnetic pressure. Interestingly, when the ram pressure is not much stronger than the magnetic pressure, typically for higher mass stars, the inclusion of ram pressure can be beneficial to the magnetosphere due to the magnetopause currents. A magnetosphere with the size of that of modern Earth is difficult to achieve with the current assumptions. However, an early Earth magnetosphere is achieved by roughly half of our hypothetical planets orbiting the outer radius of the HZ in most of the considered cases. We find that deviations from the Parker spiral can affect the results significantly, reducing the magnetosphere by $56\%$ in extreme cases. Most of the hypothetical planets are most likely (or might be) tidally locked, with the notable exception of those orbiting the outer HZ of GJ 846 and V1005 Ori.</description>

      <title>Mass-Radius relationship and Gravitational Wave Emission from Spheroidal Magnetized Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we have studied the masses, equatorial radii and gravitational wave strain amplitudes of strongly magnetized oblate spheroidal quark stars. We have used an anisotropic Equation of State (EoS) based on the MIT bag model, extended to incorporate the effects of strong magnetic fields and the resulting pressure anisotropy due to the breaking of spatial rotational symmetry. Our analysis includes both magnetized free strange quark matter (MSQM) and magnetized color-flavor locked (MCFL) phases. The masses and equatorial radii are computed using the stellar structure equations in presence of the {\gamma}-metric. We also computed the ellipticity, the gravitational redshift, the mass quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability for two values of bag constants: 65 MeV/ fm^3 and 75 MeV/ fm^3, for both MSQM and MCFL phases. Additionally, using the mass quadrupole moment, we have calculated the gravitational wave strain amplitudes for isolated deformed rotating magnetized quark stars.</description>

      <title>Barium abundances of A--F--G type stars in the Hyades cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an aim of clarifying the extent and parameter-dependence of compositional anomaly of barium in A-type stars, Ba abundances were spectroscopically determined based on BaII 6141/6496 lines for 89 (23 A-type and 66 F--G-type) main-sequence stars belonging to the members of Hyades cluster by taking into account the non-LTE effect and the hyper-fine-structure effect. While the non-LTE effect tends to strengthen lines in G stars, it acts in the direction of line weakening in the regime of A stars due to increasing imortance of overionization. The Ba abundances of G stars turned out almost constant (&lt;A&gt;= 2.33), indicating that the primordial composition of Ba in Hyades is mildly supersolar by ~+0.2dex. In contrast, A-type stars show Ba overabundances of considerably large dispersion (0~&lt;[Ba/H]~&lt;2). Since this Ba excess tends to increase with an increase/decrease in Teff/vsini, these two parameters may be essential for producing or controling the anomaly. Regarding Hyades F-type stars, their Ba abundances are not uniform but show a broad depression (by &lt;~0.3dex) around Teff~6500K, interestingly coinciding with the location of Li-dip.</description>

      <title>Scaler data from the Pierre Auger Observatory as a proxy of solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity variations strongly impact the modulation of the flux of low-energy Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) reaching the Earth. The secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of GCRs with the atmosphere, can be revealed by an array of ground detectors. We show that the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded over 16 years of operation by the surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malarg\"ue (Argentina) strongly reflects solar activity and can be considered as a new proxy of solar variability. To achieve this result, we apply advanced spectral methods to this time series and to the classical solar sunspot number and sunspot area series. We detect and compare highly significant variations with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale and identify the origin of each variability mode. In conclusion, we show that the Auger scaler data, thanks to the very low noise level and high statistical significance related to the very high count rates ($\sim 10^6$ counts per second), allow for a thorough and detailed investigation of the GCR flux variations in the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Assessing the star formation history of all-sky and part-sky 100pc white dwarf samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to Gaia and large-scale spectroscopic follow-up surveys (4MOST, DESI, WEAVE, SDSS-V), it is now possible to build representative and minimally biased samples of the local white dwarf population. Here we analyse several volume-limited 100pc samples of white dwarfs, constructed from different surveys and studies, to evaluate their completeness and residual biases. We model the underlying star formation history and Galactic disc age via comparison with simulated populations of white dwarfs to quantitatively characterise completeness. We assess whether the benefit of Gaia XP spectra in datasets outweighs the reduction in sample size, and to what extent targeted, part-sky, and magnitude limited surveys can be used in comparison to all-sky volume limited surveys. Additionally, we simulate the 4MOST 100PC sub-survey and discuss its use to better understand the local star formation history.</description>

      <title>DKIST resolves sub-arcsec photospheric scattering polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering polarization signals offer a unique diagnostics of the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere, in particular magnetic fields via the Hanle effect. However, their spatial structure remains poorly constrained due to the difficulty of achieving high spatial resolution and polarimetric sensitivity simultaneously. We present the first direct observation of sub-arcsecond structuring in the linear scattering polarization of the photospheric Sr i 4607 \AA\, line near the solar disk center ($\mu$ = 0.74), obtained with the Visible Spectro- Polarimeter (ViSP) at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The data achieve about 0".2 resolution with 30 s integration and sufficient sensitivity to detect fine-scale patterns in the total linear polarization, which are evident in Sr i but absent in a nearby Fe i line that is simultaneously observed. Since this Fe i line is more Zeeman-sensitive than the Sr i 4607 \AA\, this disparity confirms that the signals in the Sr i 4607 \AA\, line arise from scattering. These data provide the first spatially resolved two-dimensional maps of photospheric scattering polarization at sub-arcsecond scales, enabled by the capabilities of a 4-meter solar telescope.</description>

      <title>Doubling the Number of Blue Large-Amlitude Pulsators: Final Results of Searches for BLAPs in the OGLE Inner Galactic Bulge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are rare short-period ($\lesssim$80 min) pulsating variable stars exhibiting large-amplitude brightness variations (typically between 0.1 and 0.4 mag). As a recently discovered class of radial-mode pulsators, the origin and nature of these variables remain the subject of ongoing investigations. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of all BLAPs identified in the data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), including the discovery of 88 new BLAPs in the inner Galactic bulge fields. We performed a systematic search for periodic signals in the $I$-band light curves of more than 400 milion stars with magnitudes down to $I = 21$. Our search effectively doubles the number of these variables to almost 200. The detected BLAPs exhibit pulsation periods between roughly 5 and 76 minutes. The analyzed dataset covers a timespan from 2001 to 2024, with some stars observed up to 20,000 times, providing the temporal coverage needed to study period and amplitude variations. We report on three objects that show enormous period changes, at a rate of $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, which could provide important clues to the evolutionary status of BLAPs. Full dataset is incorporated into the publicly available OGLE Collection of Variable Stars (OCVS), enabling future studies of these enigmatic objects.</description>

      <title>The long-term effects of gas removal from hydrodynamic simulations of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The removal of gas left over from star formation has long been thought to dominate the dynamical evolution, and dissolution of star-forming regions. Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid timescales (&lt;10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal. Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with (sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>The Opacity Project: R-Matrix Calculations for Opacities of High-Energy-Density Astrophysical and Laboratory Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of opacity is critical for understanding radiation transport in both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. We employ atomic data from R-Matrix calculations to investigate radiative properties in high-energy-density (HED) plasma sources. Specifically, we analyze environments such as the base of the convective zone (BCZ) of the Sun 2 x 10^6$ K, N_e = 10^{23}/cc and the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device at the Sandia Z facility 2.11 x 10^6 K, N_e = 3.16 x 10^{22}/cc. We calculate Rosseland Mean Opacities (RMO) within a range of temperatures and densities and analyze how they vary under different plasma conditions. In this study, we specifically focus on electron collisional and Stark ion microfield broadening effects on autoionizing resonances in photoabsorption cross sections. Our results are relevant to astrophysical models, particularly in the context of the solar opacity problem, and provide insights into discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. In addition, we investigate the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities. In addition, we examine the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities of the "chemical picture" Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen EOS with respect to level populations of excited levels included in the R-matrix calculations. This study should contribute to improving opacity models of HED sources such as stellar interiors adn laboratory fusion plasma experiments.</description>

Abstract: Glitches in neutron stars originate from the sudden transfer of angular momentum between superfluid components and the observable crust. By modeling this glitch dynamics, including vortex motion, mutual friction, and angular momentum exchange, we can probe the dense matter equation of state. We match theoretical predictions of glitch rise times, overshoot patterns, and relaxation timescales to the well-documented observations of the 2016 Vela glitch. Our model incorporates microphysical parameters such as the mutual friction coefficient $\mathcal{B}$, which in the core arises from electron scattering off magnetized vortices, and in the crust from Kelvin wave excitation during vortex-lattice interactions. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the timing residuals reveals detailed glitch dynamics: the crustal superfluid couples on timescales of $\sim100$ seconds, the core exhibits overshoot behavior due to strong central behavior, and the inner crust shows weak entrainment, with $\sim70\%$ of free neutrons remaining superfluid. The modeled rise times are consistent with the observed upper limit of 12.6 seconds, and the observed overshoot requires strong crustal friction but weak core friction, supporting a spatially varying $\mathcal{B}$.These findings highlight the importance of microphysical modeling and demonstrate the potential of future high-cadence timing observations to further constrain the internal dynamics and composition of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Simulation-calibrated Bayesian inference for progenitor properties of the microquasar SS 433</title>

Abstract: SS\,433 is one of the most extreme Galactic X-ray binaries, exhibiting semi-relativistic jets and super-critical accretion, and harboring a compact object, likely a black hole. Despite decades of observation and modeling, the precise nature of its progenitor binary remains uncertain. To estimate the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) properties of binaries that evolve into SS\,433-like systems, we apply simulation-based calibration to Bayesian inference and convolve a multivariate Gaussian likelihood constructed from six measured binary parameters of SS\,433 with the isolated binary evolution model \textsc{COSMIC}. Employing the dynamic nested sampler of \texttt{dynesty}, we perform posterior inference over a ten-dimensional progenitor parameter space defined by the masses, orbital parameters, mass transfer possibilities, and natal kick velocity. We find that SS\,433-like systems arise from specific regions of binary evolution parameter space depending on key assumptions, such as the mass transfer rate and uncertainty taken from observations. Our simulation-based calibration framework, implemented with a suite of machine learning algorithms and scored by a heuristic reliability metric, allows us to iteratively build posterior distributions of the progenitors of SS\,433-like systems. This analysis reveals 90\% confidence intervals for the ZAMS primary mass $(8, 11)$ M$_\odot$, secondary mass $(32, 40)$ M$_\odot $, orbital period $(136, 2259)$ days, eccentricity $(0.26, 0.6)$, common envelope evolution efficiency $(0.44, 0.76)$, accreted fraction in stable mass transfer $(0.22, 0.6)$, and black hole natal kick velocity magnitude $(5, 68)$ km/s. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct probabilistic inference of X-ray binary progenitors to offer new insights into the evolution of high-accretion-rate systems such as SS\,433.</description>

      <title>Revealing the ages of metal-rich RR Lyrae via kinematic label transfer</title>

Abstract: RR Lyrae stars have long been considered reliable tracers of old, metal-poor populations, primarily due to their prevalence in globular clusters and the Galactic halo. However, the discovery of a metal-rich subpopulation in the Galactic disc, kinematically colder and more rotationally supported, challenges this classical view. Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars is crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what Galactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the unprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution of metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira variables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation, serve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae stars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across different metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &gt; -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with long-period ($\rm{period}\approx 150\,\rm{days}$), young Mira variable population; its age corresponds to $\sim 6-7$ Gyr (adopting the period-age relation in Zhang &amp; Sanders 2023) that is significantly younger than typically assumed for RR Lyrae stars. In contrast, those with $-1 &lt; [\rm Fe/H] &lt; -0.5$ show properties more aligned with older ($\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly we also find evidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR Lyrae, one younger with ages between 4 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging from 8 to 9 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations. This finding challenges the current model of RR Lyrae formation and supports alternative formation scenarios, such as binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundances in the disk around T Chamaeleontis (T Cha): PAH sizes, ionization fraction, and mass during JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The T Tauri star T Cha is known to have a protoplanetary disk with a dust gap separating the inner and outer disk regions. The mid-infrared JWST spectrum of T Cha shows multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include PAH dust grains, which are stochastically heated, in our model calculations to simulate the AIBs. Thus, we estimate the PAH abundances from our modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located within the outer disk in our model. Given our best fiducial model, we estimate a population of small PAHs of &lt;26 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of $\sim0.15$. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of ~7$\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to ~17% of the PAH-to-dust mass ratio observed in the ISM. We predict the outer disk to have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains, sizes limited up to $\mu$m-order, in order to properly fit the continuum slope within 14-25 $\mu$m. We propose a possibility of sub-micron dust grains within the gap to justify an observed plateau around ~10 $\mu$m in the JWST spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Growth of the Central Black Holes in Quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations by JWST have confirmed the presence of supermassive black holes (BHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, lending support to scenarios in which BHs experience rapid growth through intense gas accretion. Here we investigate the growth of a BH embedded at the center of a quasi-star, a theoretically predicted object formed via direct collapse. In a quasi-star, the central BH accretes at a highly super-Eddington rate, while the excess energy is transported outward by convection and radiated at approximately the Eddington luminosity of the entire star. We employ the open-source stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} to construct quasi-star models and follow the time-dependent growth of the central BH under different prescriptions for the accretion rate at the inner boundary $R_i$, and further considering the effect of winds. For the case $R_i=NR_{\rm B}$, where $N$ is a constant and $R_{\rm B}$ is the Bondi radius corresponding to the mass of the BH and the gas infalling onto it, our models terminate when the BH mass reaches a critical value $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(N)=c_{s,i}^3/(12\sqrt{N^3G^3\pi\rho_i})$ (where $c_{s,i}$ and $\rho_i$ are the sound speed and density at $R_i$, respectively), a limit we also derive analytically. Models that feature an inner convective region matched to an outer adiabatic envelope exhibit BH growth up to approximately $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\star\simeq 0.33$, largely independent of the stellar mass $M_\star$ itself. This ratio is approximately preserved even in the presence of mass loss, as several properties of the model are independent of the quasi-star's total mass.</description>

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XX. Constraining the Chemical Tracers of Young Protostellar Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the formation of planets in protoplanetary disks begins early in the embedded Class 0/I phases of protostellar evolution. The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1", 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)". Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.</description>
