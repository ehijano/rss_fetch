      <title>Integrated 4D/5D Digital-Twin Framework for Cost Estimation and Probabilistic Schedule Control: A Texas Mid-Rise Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent cost and schedule overruns in U.S. building projects expose limitations of conventional, document-based estimating and deterministic Critical Path Method (CPM) scheduling, which remain inflexible under uncertainty and lag dynamic field conditions. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework unifying Building Information Modeling (BIM), natural language processing (NLP), reality capture, computer vision, Bayesian risk modeling, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for construction cost and schedule control. The system automates project-control functions by: (a) mapping contract documents to standardized cost items using transformer-based NLP (0.883 weighted F1 score); (b) aligning photogrammetry and LiDAR data with BIM to compute earned value; (c) deriving real-time activity completion from site imagery (0.891 micro accuracy); (d) updating probabilistic CPM forecasts via Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulation; (e) using DRL for adaptive resource allocation (75% adoption rate); and (f) providing 4D/5D decision sandbox for predictive analysis. A Texas mid-rise case study demonstrates localized cost adjustment using RSMeans City Cost Index and Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data. Results show 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% overtime reduction (91 hours), and project completion matching P50 probabilistic forecast of 128 days, confirming improved estimation accuracy and responsiveness.</description>

      <title>AquaSentinel: Next-Generation AI System Integrating Sensor Networks for Urban Underground Water Pipeline Anomaly Detection via Collaborative MoE-LLM Agent Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground pipeline leaks and infiltrations pose significant threats to water security and environmental safety. Traditional manual inspection methods provide limited coverage and delayed response, often missing critical anomalies. This paper proposes AquaSentinel, a novel physics-informed AI system for real-time anomaly detection in urban underground water pipeline networks. We introduce four key innovations: (1) strategic sparse sensor deployment at high-centrality nodes combined with physics-based state augmentation to achieve network-wide observability from minimal infrastructure; (2) the RTCA (Real-Time Cumulative Anomaly) detection algorithm, which employs dual-threshold monitoring with adaptive statistics to distinguish transient fluctuations from genuine anomalies; (3) a Mixture of Experts (MoE) ensemble of spatiotemporal graph neural networks that provides robust predictions by dynamically weighting model contributions; (4) causal flow-based leak localization that traces anomalies upstream to identify source nodes and affected pipe segments. Our system strategically deploys sensors at critical network junctions and leverages physics-based modeling to propagate measurements to unmonitored nodes, creating virtual sensors that enhance data availability across the entire network. Experimental evaluation using 110 leak scenarios demonstrates that AquaSentinel achieves 100% detection accuracy. This work advances pipeline monitoring by demonstrating that physics-informed sparse sensing can match the performance of dense deployments at a fraction of the cost, providing a practical solution for aging urban infrastructure.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm with Log-Normal Distribution for Optimizing Coverage of Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are essential for monitoring and communication in complex environments, where coverage optimization directly affects performance and energy efficiency. However, traditional algorithms such as the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) often suffer from limited exploration and premature convergence. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced WOA which is called GLNWOA. GLNWOA integrates a log-normal distribution model into WOA to improve convergence dynamics and search diversity. GLNWOA employs a Good Nodes Set initialization for uniform population distribution, a Leader Cognitive Guidance Mechanism for efficient information sharing, and an Enhanced Spiral Updating Strategy to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Tests on benchmark functions verify its superior convergence accuracy and robustness. In WSN coverage optimization, deploying 25 nodes in a 60 m $\times$ 60 m area achieved a 99.0013\% coverage rate, outperforming AROA, WOA, HHO, ROA, and WOABAT by up to 15.5\%. These results demonstrate that GLNWOA offers fast convergence, high stability, and excellent optimization capability for intelligent network deployment.</description>

      <title>Sensor Informativeness, Identifiability, and Uncertainty in Bayesian Inverse Problems for Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the recovery of distributed mechanical parameters from sparse data is often ill-posed, raising critical questions about identifiability and the reliability of inferred states. While deterministic regularization methods such as Tikhonov stabilise the inversion, they provide little insight into the spatial limits of resolution or the inherent uncertainty of the solution. This paper presents a Bayesian inverse framework that rigorously quantifies these limits, using the identification of distributed flexural rigidity from rotation (tilt) influence lines as a primary case study. Fisher information is employed as a diagnostic metric to quantify sensor informativeness, revealing how specific sensor layouts and load paths constrain the recoverable spatial features of the parameter field.
  The methodology is applied to the full-scale openLAB research bridge (TU Dresden) using data from controlled vehicle passages. Beyond estimating the flexural rigidity profile, the Bayesian formulation produces credible intervals that expose regions of practical non-identifiability, which deterministic methods may obscure. The results demonstrate that while the measurement data carry high information content for the target parameters, their utility is spatially heterogeneous and strictly bounded by the experiment design. The proposed framework unifies identification with uncertainty quantification, providing a rigorous basis for optimising sensor placement and interpreting the credibility of SHM diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two dominant blockchain consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), evaluated across seven critical metrics: energy use, security, transaction speed, scalability, centralization risk, environmental impact, and transaction fees. Utilizing recent academic research and real-world blockchain data, the study highlights that PoW offers robust, time-tested security but suffers from high energy consumption, slower throughput, and centralization through mining pools. In contrast, PoS demonstrates improved scalability and efficiency, significantly reduced environmental impact, and more stable transaction fees, however it raises concerns over validator centralization and long-term security maturity. The findings underscore the trade-offs inherent in each mechanism and suggest hybrid designs may combine PoW's security with PoS's efficiency and sustainability. The study aims to inform future blockchain infrastructure development by striking a balance between decentralization, performance, and ecological responsibility.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.
  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.
  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.
  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Transient Nonlinear Circuit Simulator Using Exponential Integration and Block-Jacobi Precondition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient simulation of linear and nonlinear circuits remains an important task in modern EDA tools. At present, SPICE-like simulators face challenges in parallelization, nonlinear convergence and linear efficiency, especially when applied to large-scale circuits. To address the limitations of simulators in handling various nonlinear circuits, we adopt a generalized row-echelon regularization approach, which extends the applicability of exponential integrators to a broader class of differential algebraic equations. The proposed method employs matrix exponential vector products to integrate the regularized system, allowing for a larger time step size while preserving accuracy and stability. Furthermore, in order to accelerate GMRES-based solvers within Newton-Raphson iterations, a structured block-Jacobi preconditioner is designed for linear systems. For locally coupled circuits, Additive Schwarz overlapping strategy is adopted to enhance the solution performance. Numerical experiments of various nonlinear circuit models show that under same hardware environment, our method achieves a speedup of 1.95$\times$-- 3.27$\times$ in total computation time compared to Backward Euler with Inexact Newton iterations, and time steps have decreased by an average of 60.70\% (up to 74.59\%). Compared with EI-NK method, total computing time of our method has a speedup of 1.08$\times$-- 1.79$\times$. These results highlight the potential of proposed method for scalable and nonlinear circuit simulation.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap in XAI-Why Reliable Metrics Matter for Explainability and Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable explainability is not only a technical goal but also a cornerstone of private AI governance. As AI models enter high-stakes sectors, private actors such as auditors, insurers, certification bodies, and procurement agencies require standardized evaluation metrics to assess trustworthiness. However, current XAI evaluation metrics remain fragmented and prone to manipulation, which undermines accountability and compliance. We argue that standardized metrics can function as governance primitives, embedding auditability and accountability within AI systems for effective private oversight. Building upon prior work in XAI benchmarking, we identify key limitations in ensuring faithfulness, tamper resistance, and regulatory alignment. Furthermore, interpretability can directly support model alignment by providing a verifiable means of ensuring behavioral integrity in General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems. This connection between interpretability and alignment positions XAI metrics as both technical and regulatory instruments that help prevent alignment faking, a growing concern among oversight bodies. We propose a Governance by Metrics paradigm that treats explainability evaluation as a central mechanism of private AI governance. Our framework introduces a hierarchical model linking transparency, tamper resistance, scalability, and legal alignment, extending evaluation from model introspection toward systemic accountability. Through conceptual synthesis and alignment with governance standards, we outline a roadmap for integrating explainability metrics into continuous AI assurance pipelines that serve both private oversight and regulatory needs.</description>
