      <title>A case study on different one-factor Cheyette models for short maturity caplet calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [1], we calibrated a one-factor Cheyette SLV model with a local volatility that is linear in the benchmark forward rate and an uncorrelated CIR stochastic variance to 3M caplets of various maturities. While caplet smiles for many maturities could be reasonably well calibrated across the range of strikes, for instance the 1Y maturity could not be calibrated well across that entire range of strikes. Here, we study whether models with alternative local volatility terms and/or alternative stochastic volatility or variance models can calibrate the 1Y caplet smile better across the strike range better than the model studied in [1]. This is made possible and feasible by the generic simulation, pricing, and calibration frameworks introduced in [1] and some new frameworks presented in this paper. We find that some model settings calibrate well to the 1Y smile across the strike range under study. In particular, a model setting with a local volatility that is piece-wise linear in the benchmark forward rate together with an uncorrelated CIR stochastic variance and one with a local volatility that is linear in the benchmark rate together with a correlated lognormal stochastic volatility with quadratic drift (QDLNSV) as in [2] calibrate well. We discuss why the later might be a preferable model.

      <title>Joint Calibration to SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from SPX options and derivatives of VIX are also traded in market, which leads to the so-called "consistent modeling" problem. This paper proposes a time-changed L\'evy model for log price with a composite change of time structure to capture both features of the implied SPX volatility and the implied volatility of volatility. Consistent modeling is achieved naturally via flexible choices of jumps and leverage effects, as well as the composition of time changes. Many celebrated models are covered as special cases. From this model, we derive an explicit form of the characteristic function for the asset price (SPX) and the pricing formula for European options as well as VIX options. The empirical results indicate great competence of the proposed model in the problem of joint calibration of the SPX/VIX Markets.</description>

      <title>Local Volatility in Interest Rate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13595v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local Volatility (LV) is a very powerful tool for market modeling. This tool can be used to generate arbitrage-free scenarios calibrated to all available options. Here we demonstrate how to implement LV in order to reproduce most swaption prices within a single model.
  There was a good agreement between market prices and Monte Carlo prices for all tenors and maturities from 2 to 20 years. Note that due to the use of a normal distribution in the scenario generation process, the volatility of short-term swaptions cannot be generated accurately.</description>
