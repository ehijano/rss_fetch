      <title>Continuous high-yield fast neutron generation with few-cycle laser pulses at 10 Hz for applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a laser-based neutron source that produces $1.8 \times 10^5$ neutrons/s with a conversion rate of $7.8 \times 10^5$ neutrons/J. Laser pulses of 12 fs and 23 mJ were focused onto a 430-nm-thick heavy water liquid sheet at a 10 Hz repetition rate. The resulting peak intensity of $4 \times 10^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ accelerated deuterium ions from the target rear side to a kinetic energy of 1 MeV. This deuteron beam induced $^{2}$H(d,n)$^{3}$He fusion reactions in a deuterated polyethylene target, producing fast neutrons. The neutron yield was measured using two independent detection systems: the LILITH time-of-flight spectrometer, consisting of eight plastic scintillators covering nearly $180^\circ$, and a calibrated bubble detector spectrometer. The neutron yield per laser shot is 35 times higher than that recently achieved by lasers with comparable pulse energies, while the conversion rate is the highest ever achieved by continuously operating, sub-100 fs lasers. The generated neutrons are emitted from an area of 0.65 cm$^2$ corresponding to the deuteron beam spot on the catcher. Their angular distribution is peaked in forward and backward directions in agreement with the literature data on the angular distribution of $^{2}$H(d,n)$^{3}$He reaction. The system operated continuously for several hours per day with an unprecedented stability of 5%.</description>

      <title>Research on trigger technology of MRPC TOF-PET system and imaging results of $^{22}$Na radioactive source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on developing a self-triggered data acquisition system and a noise reduction algorithm for the Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET) system. The system integrates a fast front-end amplifier, a waveform digitization module based on the DRS4 chip, and an efficient noise reduction algorithm to address challenges such as high noise trigger rates and precise gamma-ray detection. The proposed self-triggered system, through threshold discrimination, coincidence logic, and continuous oscillation check, reduces the noise trigger rate to 0.004 Hz. Experimental results show that the system accurately localizes and images the $^{22}$Na radioactive source, and has a good time resolution of 162 ps FWHM for 0.511 MeV gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Extending frequency metrology to increasingly complex molecules: SI-traceable sub-Doppler mid-IR spectroscopy of trioxane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bringing increasingly complex polyatomic molecules within reach of precision measurement experiments offers fascinating and far-reaching prospects ranging from Earth sciences and astrophysics, to metrology and quantum sciences. Here, we demonstrate sub-Doppler spectroscopic measurements in the mid-IR fingerprint region of, to our knowledge, the largest molecule to date. To this end, we use a high-resolution ~10.3 $\mu$m spectrometer based on a sub-Hz quantum cascade laser remotely calibrated against state-of-the-art primary frequency standards via a metrology-grade fibre link. We perform saturated absorption spectroscopy in the v5 CO stretching mode of 1,3,5-trioxane, (H2CO)3, at a resolution of ~100 kHz, allowing us to measure the absolute frequency of hundreds of rovibrational transitions at unprecedented uncertainties for such a complex species, as low as ~5 kHz. Our work demonstrates the extension of frequency metrology methodologies to ever larger molecular system, confirming the potential of the technologies we develop for bringing increasingly complex species within reach of ultra-precise measurement experiments.</description>

      <title>DUNE: science and status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. Its primary goal is the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and the CP-violating phase. The DUNE physics program also includes the detection of astrophysical neutrinos and the search for beyond the Standard Model phenomena, such as nucleon decays. DUNE will consist of a near detector complex placed at Fermilab, several hundred meters downstream of the neutrino production point, and 17-kton Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) far detector modules to be built in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), approximately 1.5 km underground and 1300 km away. The detectors will be exposed to a wide-band neutrino beam generated by a 1.2 MW proton beam, with a planned upgrade to 2.4 MW. Two prototypes of the FD technology, the ProtoDUNE 700 ton LArTPCs, have been operated at CERN for over 2 years, and have been recently optimized to take new data in 2024-2025. Additionally, the 2x2 Demonstrator, a prototype of the LAr component of the near detector, has recently started operations in the NuMI beam at Fermilab. This talk will present the science programme, as well as recent progress, of DUNE and its different prototyping efforts.</description>

      <title>Performance studies of the CE-65v2 MAPS prototype structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the next upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system (ITS3) as its primary focus, a set of small MAPS test structures have been developed in the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS process. The CE-65 focuses on the characterisation of the analogue charge collection properties of this technology. The latest iteration, the CE-65v2, was produced in different processes (standard, with a low-dose n-type blanket, and blanket with gap between pixels), pixel pitches (15, 18, 22.5 $\mu$m), and pixel arrangements (square or staggered). The comparatively large pixel array size of $48\times24$ pixels in CE-65v2 allows the uniformity of the pixel response to be studied, among other benefits.
  The CE-65v2 chip was characterised in a test beam at the CERN SPS. A first analysis showed that hit efficiencies of $\geq 99\%$ and spatial resolution better than 5 $\mu$m can be achieved for all pitches and process variants. For the standard process, thanks to larger charge sharing, even spatial resolutions below 3 $\mu$m are reached, in line with vertex detector requirements for the FCC-ee.
  This contribution further investigates the data collected at the SPS test beam. Thanks to the large sensor size and efficient data collection, a large amount of statistics was collected, which allows for detailed in-pixel studies to see the efficiency and spatial resolution as a function of the hit position within the pixels. Again, different pitches and process variants are compared.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Relaxation Oscillations in Superconducting Nanobridge Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of ~19 MHz. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. An electrical model that does not include thermal effects can be used to simulate the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Good agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.</description>
