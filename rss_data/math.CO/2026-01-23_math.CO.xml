      <title>Maximal Green Sequences for Cluster Algebras Associated to Closed Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the existence of a maximal green sequence for a quiver associated to surfaces is equivalent to the equality of the cluster algebra and upper cluster algebra generated by the quiver. This paper makes the first steps in investigating this behavior in the generalised case of cluster algebras from orbifolds; determining when such surfaces admit a diagram with a maximal green sequence. Specifically, we will provide a triangulation for the orientable surfaces of genus $n$ with an arbitrary number of orbifold points and arbitrary number of punctures, determine when it has a maximal green sequence, and construct one if it exists.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ramsey Numbers in the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized Ramsey numbers $f(Q_n, C_{k}, q)$, that is, the minimum number of colors needed to edge-color the hypercube $Q_n$ so that every copy of the cycle $C_{k}$ has at least $q$ colors. Our main result is that for any integers $k,q$ satisfying $k \geq 6$ and $3 \leq q \leq k/2+1$, we have $f(Q_n, C_{k}, q)= o\left( n^{\frac{k/2-1}{k-q+1}} \right).$ We also prove a few other upper and lower bounds in the special cases $k=4$ and $k=6$. This continues the line of research initiated by Faudree, Gy\'arf\'as, Lesniak, and Schelp and Mubayi and Stading who studied the case $k=q$, and by Conder who considered the case $k=6$ and $q=2$.</description>

      <title>Maps on Surfaces as a Structural Framework for Genus-One Virtual Knot Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a purely combinatorial framework for the systematic enumeration of knot and link diagrams supported on the thickened torus $T^2\times I$. Using the theory of maps on surfaces, cellular $4$--regular torus projections are encoded by permutation pairs $(\alpha,\sigma)$, and unsensed projection classes are enumerated completely and without duplication via canonical representatives. For a fixed projection, crossing assignments are encoded by bit data, and an immediate Reidemeister~II reduction supported by a bigon face is characterized directly in terms of these bits. The genus-one generalized Kauffman-type bracket is then evaluated as a state sum entirely within the permutation model, without drawing diagrams in a fundamental polygon.
  The implementation is validated against published genus-one classifications for $N\le 5$ under explicit comparison conventions, with remaining discrepancies explained at the level of global conventions. Beyond the published range, we compute projection and diagram data for crossing numbers up to $N=8$ and provide a public reference implementation together with machine-readable datasets. Via the standard correspondence between virtual knots and knots in thickened surfaces, this yields a canonical and fully reproducible genus-one framework for virtual knot tabulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lift to the multivariate Eulerian polynomials the identity implying that univariate Eulerian polynomials are palindromic. As a consequence of this generalization, we obtain nice combinatorial identities that can be directly extracted from this polynomial relation and the bijection between permutations involved in the proof of the identity.</description>

      <title>Degree-choosability of proper conflict-free list coloring of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a mapping $f:V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$, an $f$-list assignment of $G$ is a function that maps each $v \in V(G)$ to a set of at least $f(v)$ colors. For an $f$-list assignment $L$ of a graph $G$, a proper conflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ such that for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, $\phi(v) \in L(v)$ and some appears precisely once in the neighborhood of $v$. We say that $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable if for every $f$-list assignment $L$ of $G$, there exists a proper conflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$. If $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable and there is a constant $k$ such that $f(v)= d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$, then we say $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable. In this paper, we consider graphs with a bounded maximum average degree. We show that every graph with the maximum average degree less than $\frac{10}{3}$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+3)$-choosable, and that every graph with the maximum average degree less than $\frac{18}{7}$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+2)$-choosable. As a result, every planar graph with girth at least $5$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+3)$-choosable, and every planar graph with girth at least $9$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+2)$-choosable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a_{r,s}(n)$ denote the number of mutlicolored partitions of $n$, wherein both even parts and odd parts may appear in one of $r$-colors and $s$-colors, respectively, for fixed $r,s\ge 1$. The paper aims to study arithmetic properties satisfied by $a_{r,s}(n)$, using elementary generating function manipulations and classical $q$-series techniques.</description>

      <title>Shuriken Graphs Arising from Clean Graphs of Rings and Their Properties Relative to Base Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring with identity. The idempotent graph $I(R)$ is the graph whose vertex set consists of the non-trivial idempotent elements of $R$, where two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $xy = yx = 0$. The clean graph $Cl_2(R)$ is a graph whose vertices are of the form $(e, u)$, where $e$ is a nonzero idempotent element and $u$ is a unit of $R$. Two distinct vertices $(e,u)$ and $(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = fe = 0$ or $uv = vu = 1$. The shuriken graph operation is an operation that arises from the structure of the clean graph and depends on the structure of the associated idempotent graph. In this paper, we study the graph obtained from the shuriken operation and examine how its properties depend on those of the base graph. In particular, we investigate several graph invariants, including the clique number, chromatic number, independence number, and domination number. Moreover, we analyze topological indices and characterize Eulerian and Hamiltonian properties of the resulting shuriken graphs in terms of the properties of the base graphs.</description>

      <title>Weakly pancyclic vertices in dense nonbipartite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of girth $g$ and circumference $c.$ A vertex $v$ of $G$ is called weakly pancyclic if $v$ lies on an $\ell$-cycle for every integer $\ell$ with $g\le \ell\le c.$ We prove that if $G$ is a nonbipartite graph of order $n\ge 5$ and size at least $\left\lfloor(n-1)^2/4\right\rfloor+2,$ then $G$ contains three weakly pancyclic vertices, with one exception. This strengthens a result of Brandt from 1997. We also pose a related problem.</description>

      <title>Tangle structure trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive data structure, tangle structure trees, which simultaneously displays all the $\mathcal{F}$-tangles of an abstract separation system for very general obstruction sets $\mathcal{F}$. It simultaneously also displays certificates $\sigma\in\mathcal{F}$ for any non-existence of such tangles, or for the non-extendability of low-order tangles to higher-order ones.
  Our theorem can be applied to produce the structures of the classical tree-of-tangles and tangle-tree duality theorems, both for graph tangles and for their known generalizations to more general separation systems. It extends those theorems to obstruction sets $\mathcal{F}$ that need not define profiles (as they must in trees of tangles) or consist of stars of separations (as they must in tangle-tree duality).
  Our existence proof for these structure trees is constructive. The construction has been implemented in open-source software available for tangle detection and further analysis.</description>

      <title>The distinguishing number of complete bipartite and crown graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinguishing number of a permutation group $G\leqslant\Sym(\Omega)$ is the minimum number of colours needed to colour $\Omega$ in such a way that the only colour preserving element of $G$ is the identity. The distinguishing number of a graph is the distinguishing number of its automorphism group (as a permutation group on vertices). We determine the distinguishing number of the complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$ and the crown graphs $K_{n,n}-nK_2$, as well as the distinguishing number of some `large' subgroups of their automorphism groups, that is, the subgroups that are vertex- and edge-transitive and such that the induced action on each bipart is $\Alt(n)$ or $\Sym(n)$. We show that, if $G$ is a `large' group of automorphisms of $K_{n,n}$, then $n-1\leqslant D(G) \leqslant n+1$. Similarly, if $G$ is a `large' group of automorphisms of a crown graph, then $\lceil \sqrt{n-1}\rceil \leqslant D(G)\leqslant \lfloor \sqrt{n}\rfloor+1$.

      <title>Mutation Of Matrices Over Group Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a precise definition of mutation of skew symmetrizable matrices over group rings and relate it to folding and mutation of quivers with symmetries. These matrices can have non-zero diagonal entries and we explain a mutation rule in some of these cases as well. This new rule comes from a notion of a generalized mutation of an entire quiver or sub-quiver.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm to Generate all Labeled Triangle-free Graphs with a given Graphical Degree Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous algorithm that generates all labeled graphs with a given graphical degree sequence to generate all labeled triangle-free graphs with a given graphical degree sequence. The algorithm uses various pruning techniques to avoid having to first generate all labeled realizations of the input sequence and then testing whether each labeled realization is triangle-free. It can be further extended to generate all labeled bipartite graphs with a given graphical degree sequence by adding a simple test whether each generated triangle-free realization is a bipartite graph. All output graphs are generated in the lexicographical ordering as in the original algorithm. The algorithms can also be easily parallelized.</description>

      <title>A brief note about p-curvature on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Wang's $CD_p(m,K)$ condition on graphs, which depends on the $p$-Laplacian $\Delta_p$ for $p&gt;1$ and is an extension of the classical Bakry-\'Emery $CD(m,K)$ curvature dimension condition. We calculate several examples including paths, cycles and star graphs, and we show that the $p$-curvature is non-negative at some vertices in the case $p\geq 2$, while it approaches to $-\infty$ in the case of $1&lt;p&lt;2$. In addition, we observe that a crucial property of $\Gamma_2$ on Cartesian products does no longer hold for $\Gamma_2^p$ in the case of $p &gt; 2$. As a consequence, an analogous proof that non-negative curvature is preserved under taking Cartesian products is not possible for $p &gt; 2$.</description>

Abstract: We study countable graphs that -- up to isomorphism and with probability one -- arise from a random process, in a similar fashion as the Rado graph. Unlike in the classical case, we do not require that probabilities assigned to pairs of points are all equal. We give examples of such generalized random graphs, and show that the class of graphs under consideration has a two-element basis.</description>

      <title>Rainbow spanning structures in strongly edge-colored graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is a graph in which each edge is assigned a color. Such a graph is called strongly edge-colored if each color class forms an induced matching, and called rainbow if all edges receive pairwise distinct colors. In this paper, by establishing a connection with $\mu n$-bounded graphs, we prove that for all sufficiently large integers $n$, every strongly edge-colored graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $\frac{n+1}{2}$ contains a rainbow Hamilton cycle. We also characterize all strongly edge-colored graphs on $n$ vertices with minimum degree exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ that do not contain a rainbow Hamilton cycle. As an application, we determine the optimal minimum degree conditions for the existence of rainbow Hamilton paths and rainbow perfect matchings in strongly edge-colored graphs. Together, these results verify three conjectures concerning strongly edge-colored graphs for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rich $k$-flow is a nowhere-zero $k$-flow $\phi$ such that, for every pair of adjacent edges $e$ and $f$, $|\phi(e)| \neq |\phi(f)|$. A graph is rich flow admissible if it admits a rich $k$-flow for some integer $k$. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is a rich flow admissible graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, then $G$ admits a rich $(264\Delta - 445)$-flow.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Beats All-at-Once: Behavioral Gains from Sequential Choice Presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Sequential Rationality Hypothesis, which argues that consumers are better able to make utility-maximizing decisions when products appear in sequential pairwise comparisons rather than in simultaneous multi-option displays. Although this involves higher cognitive costs than the all-at-once format, the current digital market, with its diverse products listed by review ratings, pricing, and paid products, often creates inconsistent choices. The present work shows that preparing the list sequentially supports more rational choice, as the consumer tries to minimize cognitive costs and may otherwise make an irrational decision. If the decision remains the same on both offers, then that is a consistent preference. The platform uses this approach by reducing cognitive costs while still providing the list in an all-at-once format rather than sequentially. To show how sequential exposure reduces cognitive overload and prevents context-dependent errors, we develop a bounded attention model and extend the monotonic attention rule of the random attention model to theorize the sequential rational hypothesis. Using a theoretical design with common consumer goods, we test these hypotheses. This theoretical model helps policymakers in digital market laws, behavioral economics, marketing, and digital platform design consider how choice architectures may improve consumer choices and encourage rational decision-making.</description>

      <title>Counting point configurations in projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enumerative geometry of point configurations in projective space. We define "projective configuration counts": these enumerate configurations of points in projective space such that certain specified subsets are in fixed relative positions. The $\mathbb{P}^1$ case recovers cross-ratio degrees, which arise naturally in numerous contexts. We establish two main results. The first is a combinatorial upper bound given by the number of weighted transversals of a bipartite graph. The second is a recursion that relates counts associated to projective spaces of different dimensions, by projecting away from a given point. Key inputs include the Gelfand-MacPherson correspondence, the Jacobi-Trudi and Thom-Porteous formulae, and the notion of surplus from matching theory of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Rank-metric codes over arbitrary fields: Bounds and constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rank-metric codes, defined as sets of matrices over a finite field with the rank distance, have gained significant attention due to their applications in network coding and connections to diverse mathematical areas. Initially studied by Delsarte in 1978 and later rediscovered by Gabidulin, these codes have become a central topic in coding theory. This paper surveys the development and mathematical foundations, in particular, regarding bounds and constructions of rank-metric codes, emphasizing their extension beyond finite fields to more general settings. We examine Singleton-like bounds on code parameters, demonstrating their sharpness in finite field cases and contrasting this with contexts where the bounds are not tight. Furthermore, we discuss constructions of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over fields with cyclic Galois extensions and the relationship between linear rank-metric codes with systems and evasive subspaces. The paper also reviews results for algebraically closed fields and real numbers, previously appearing in the context of topology and measure theory. We conclude by proposing future research directions, including conjectures on MRD code existence and the exploration of rank-metric codes over various field extensions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a complete bipartite graph of size $n$ endowed with i.i.d. uniform edge weights and run Prim's Algorithm to obtain a ranking of its vertices. Let $\rho^{(n)}_k$ be the proportion of black vertices among the first $k$ vertices in this ranking. We characterise the limit behaviour of $\rho^{(n)}_k$ as both $n$ and $k$ tend to infinity. Our results show that in general the limit of $\rho^{(n)}_k$, when existing, differs from the overall proportion of the black vertices in the graph.</description>

      <title>Generalized Information Inequalities via Submodularity, and Two Combinatorial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a strong connection between entropy inequalities and submodularity, since the entropy of a collection of random variables is a submodular function. Unifying frameworks for information inequalities arising from submodularity were developed by Madiman and Tetali (2010) and Sason (2022). Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions. In this work, we build on these frameworks and make three contributions. First, we establish convex-functional generalizations of the strong and weak Madiman and Tetali inequalities for submodular functions. Second, using a special case of the strong Madiman-Tetali inequality, we derive a new Loomis-Whitney-type projection inequality for finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which improves upon the classical Loomis-Whitney bound by incorporating slice-level structural information. Finally, we study an extremal graph theory problem that recovers and extends the previously known results of Sason (2022) and Boucheron et al., employing Shearer's lemma in contrast to the use of Han's inequality in those works.</description>

      <title>Existential Positive Transductions of Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monadic stability generalizes many tameness notions from structural graph theory such as planarity, bounded degree, bounded tree-width, and nowhere density. The sparsification conjecture predicts that the (possibly dense) monadically stable graph classes are exactly those that can be logically encoded by first-order (FO) transductions in the (always sparse) nowhere dense classes. So far this conjecture has been verified for several special cases, such as for classes of bounded shrub-depth, and for the monadically stable fragments of bounded (linear) clique-width, twin-width, and merge-width.
  In this work we propose the existential positive sparsification conjecture, predicting that the more restricted co-matching-free, monadically stable classes are exactly those that can be transduced from nowhere dense classes using only existential positive FO formulas. While the general conjecture remains open, we verify its truth for all known special cases of the original conjecture. Even stronger, we find the sparse preimages as subgraphs of the dense input graphs.
  As a key ingredient, we introduce a new combinatorial operation, called subflip, that arises as the natural co-matching-free analog of the flip operation, which is a central tool in the characterization of monadic stability. Using subflips, we characterize the co-matching-free fragment of monadic stability by appropriate strengthenings of the known flip-flatness and flipper game characterizations for monadic stability. In an attempt to generalize our results to the more expressive MSO logic, we discover (rediscover?) that on relational structures (existential) positive MSO has the same expressive power as (existential) positive FO.</description>

      <title>On maximal rank properties for symmetric polynomials in an equigenerated monomial complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a monomial complete intersection has the strong Lefschetz property in characteristic zero. This property is equivalent to the statement that any power of the sum of the variables is a maximal rank element on the complete intersection. In this paper, we investigate what happens when this element is replaced by another symmetric polynomial, in an equigenerated complete intersection.
  We answer the question completely for the power sum symmetric polynomial using a grading technique, and for any Schur polynomial in the case of two variables by deriving a closed formula for the determinants of a family of Toeplitz matrices. Further, we obtain partial results in three or more variables for the elementary and the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs.
  We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $AW[*]\neq FPT$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove an analogue of Bonami's (hypercontractive) lemma for complex-valued functions on $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$, where $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces over a finite field. This inequality is useful for functions on $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ whose `generalised influences' are small, in an appropriate sense. It leads to a significant shortening of the proof of a recent seminal result by Khot, Minzer and Safra that pseudorandom sets in Grassmann graphs have near-perfect expansion, which (in combination with the work of Dinur, Khot, Kindler, Minzer and Safra) implies the 2-2 Games conjecture (the variant, that is, with imperfect completeness).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha\in[0,1)$, and let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$ with $n\geq f(\alpha)$, where $f(\alpha)=6$ for $\alpha\in[0,\frac{2}{3}]$ and $f(\alpha)=\frac{4}{1-\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in(\frac{2}{3},1)$. A graph $G$ is said to be $t$-tough if $|S|\geq tc(G-S)$ for each subset $S$ of $V(G)$ with $c(G-S)\geq2$, where $c(G-S)$ is the number of connected components in $G-S$. The $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of $G$ is denoted by $\rho_{\alpha}(G)$. In this paper, it is verified that $G$ is a 1-tough graph unless $G=K_1\vee(K_{n-2}\cup K_1)$ if $\rho_{\alpha}(G)\geq\rho_{\alpha}(K_1\vee(K_{n-2}\cup K_1))$, where $\rho_{\alpha}(K_1\vee(K_{n-2}\cup K_1))$ equals the largest root of $x^{3}-((\alpha+1)n+\alpha-3)x^{2}+(\alpha n^{2}+(\alpha^{2}-\alpha-1)n-2\alpha+1)x-\alpha^{2}n^{2}+(3\alpha^{2}-\alpha+1)n-4\alpha^{2}+5\alpha-3=0$. Further, we present an $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius condition for a graph to be a $t$-tough graph.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial interpretation of the Bernstein degree of unitary highest weight modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$-modules $L_{\lambda}$ for unitary highest weight representations of the real reductive group $G_{\mathbb{R}} = \operatorname{U}(p,q)$, $\operatorname{Mp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$, or $\operatorname{O}^*(2n)$, where $\operatorname{Mp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ denotes the metaplectic double cover of $\operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. Let $k$ be a positive integer. Corresponding to $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ via Howe duality is the compact group $\operatorname{U}(k)$, $\operatorname{O}(k)$, or $\operatorname{Sp}(k)$, respectively, for which every irreducible representation $\sigma$ corresponds to a unique $L_{\lambda} = L_{\lambda(\sigma)}$. Nishiyama-Ochiai-Taniguchi (2001) expressed the Bernstein degree $\operatorname{Deg} L_{\lambda(\sigma)}$ as the product of $\dim \sigma$ and the degree of the associated variety of $L_{\lambda(\sigma)}$; this result is valid when $k \leq r :=$ the real rank of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. In this paper, for arbitrary $k$, we give a new combinatorial interpretation $\operatorname{Deg} L_{\lambda(\sigma)} = \#(\mathcal{Q}_k(\sigma) \times \mathcal{P}_k)$, where $\mathcal{Q}_k(\sigma)$ is a certain set of semistandard tableaux, whose cardinality (for $k \geq r$) interpolates between $\dim \sigma$ and the dimension of the simple $K$-module with highest weight $\lambda(\sigma)$. The set $\mathcal{P}_k$ consists of certain plane partitions that encode the Hilbert series of the associated variety. We exhibit analogous sets $\mathcal{P}_k$ of plane partitions for all real reductive groups of Hermitian type, including the exceptional groups.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a general technique to construct tight fusion frames with prescribed symmetries. Applying this technique with a prescription for "all the symmetries", we construct a new family of equi-isoclinic tight fusion frames (EITFFs), which consequently form optimal Grassmannian codes. By virtue of their construction, our EITFFs have the remarkable property of total symmetry: any permutation of subspaces can be achieved by an appropriate unitary.</description>

      <title>Integer programs with nearly totally unimodular matrices: the cographic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a notorious open question whether integer programs (IPs), with an integer coefficient matrix $M$ whose subdeterminants are all bounded by a constant $\Delta$ in absolute value, can be solved in polynomial time. We answer this question in the affirmative if we further require that, by removing a constant number of rows and columns from $M$, one obtains a submatrix $A$ that is the transpose of a network matrix.
  Our approach focuses on the case where $A$ arises from $M$ after removing $k$ rows only, where $k$ is a constant. We achieve our result in two main steps, the first related to the theory of IPs and the second related to graph minor theory.
  First, we derive a strong proximity result for the case where $A$ is a general totally unimodular matrix: Given an optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation, an optimal solution to the IP can be obtained by finding a constant number of augmentations by circuits of $[A\; I]$.
  Second, for the case where $A$ is transpose of a network matrix, we reformulate the problem as a maximum constrained integer potential problem on a graph $G$. We observe that if $G$ is $2$-connected, then it has no rooted $K_{2,t}$-minor for $t = \Omega(k \Delta)$. We leverage this to obtain a tree-decomposition of $G$ into highly structured graphs for which we can solve the problem locally. This allows us to solve the global problem via dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Polynomials Counting Group Colorings in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12404v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jaeger et al. in 1992 introduced group coloring as the dual concept to group connectivity in graphs. Let $A$ be an additive Abelian group, $ f: E(G)\to A$ and $D$ an orientation of a graph $G$. A vertex coloring $c:V(G)\to A$ is an $(A, f)$-coloring if $c(v)-c(u)\ne f(e)$ for each oriented edge $e=uv$ from $u$ to $v$ under $D$. Kochol recently introduced the assigning polynomial to count nowhere-zero chains in graphs--nonhomogeneous analogues of nowhere-zero flows in \cite{Kochol2022}, and later extended the approach to regular matroids in \cite{Kochol2024}. Motivated by Kochol's work, we define the $\alpha$-compatible graph and the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G, \alpha; k)$ at $k$ in terms of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs, where $\alpha$ is an assigning of $G$ from its cycles to $\{0,1\}$. We prove that $P(G,\alpha;k)$ evaluates the number of $(A,f)$-colorings of $G$ for any Abelian group $A$ of order $k$ and $f:E(G)\to A$ such that the assigning $\alpha_{D,f}$ given by $f$ equals $\alpha$. Such an assigning is admissible. Based on Kochol's work, we derive that $k^{-c(G)}P(G,\alpha;k)$ is a polynomial enumerating $(A,f)$-tensions and counting specific nowhere-zero chains.
  Furthermore, by extending Whitney's broken cycle concept to broken compatible cycles, we show that the absolute value of the coefficient of $k^{|V(G)|-i}$ in $P(G,\alpha;k)$ associated with admissible assignings $\alpha$ equals the number of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs that have $i$ edges and contain no broken $\alpha$-compatible cycles. According to the combinatorial explanation, we establish a unified order-preserving relation from admissible assignings to cycle-assigning polynomials, and further show that for any admissible assigning $\alpha$ of $G$ with $\alpha(e)=1$ for every loop $e$, the coefficients of $P(G,\alpha;k)$ are nonzero and alternate in sign.</description>

      <title>Explosive appearance of cores and bootstrap percolation on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the process where the $n$ vertices of a square $2$-dimensional torus appear consecutively in a random order. We show that typically the size of the $3$-core of the corresponding induced unit-distance graph transitions from $0$ to $n-o(n)$ within a single step. Equivalently, by infecting the vertices of the torus in a random order, under two-neighbour bootstrap percolation, the size of the infected set transitions instantaneously from $o(n)$ to $n$. This hitting time result answers a question of Benjamini.
  We also study the much more challenging and general setting of bootstrap percolation on two-dimensional lattices for a variety of finite-range infection rules. In this case, powerful but fragile bootstrap percolation tools such as the rectangles process and the Aizenman-Lebowitz lemma become unavailable. We develop a new method complementing and replacing these standard techniques, thus allowing us to prove the above hitting time result for a wide family of threshold bootstrap percolation rules on the $2$-dimensional square lattice, including neighbourhoods given by large $\ell^p$ balls for $p\in[1,\infty]$.</description>

      <title>Myrvold's Results on Orthogonal Triples of $10 \times 10$ Latin Squares: A SAT Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since E. T. Parker constructed an orthogonal pair of $10\times10$ Latin squares in 1959, an orthogonal triple of $10\times10$ Latin squares has been one of the most sought-after combinatorial designs. Despite extensive work, the existence of such an orthogonal triple remains an open problem, though some negative results are known. In 1999, W. Myrvold derived some highly restrictive constraints in the special case in which one of the Latin squares in the triple contains a $4\times4$ Latin subsquare. In particular, Myrvold showed there were twenty-eight possible cases for an orthogonal pair in such a triple, twenty of which were removed from consideration. We implement a computational approach that quickly verifies all of Myrvold's nonexistence results and in the remaining eight cases finds explicit examples of orthogonal pairs -- thus explaining for the first time why Myrvold's approach left eight cases unsolved. As a consequence, the eight remaining cases cannot be removed by a strategy of focusing on the existence of an orthogonal pair; the third square in the triple must necessarily be considered as well.
  Our approach uses a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver to derive the nonexistence of twenty of the orthogonal pair types and find explicit examples of orthogonal pairs in the eight remaining cases. To reduce the existence problem into Boolean logic we use a duality between the concepts of transversal representation and orthogonal pair and we provide a formulation of this duality in terms of a composition operation on Latin squares. Using our SAT encoding, we find transversal representations (and equivalently orthogonal pairs) in the remaining eight cases in under two hours of computing on a large computing cluster.</description>

      <title>Deza graphs and regular polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify all regular polyhedra according to their type i.e., the collection of numbers of common neighbours that any pair of distinct vertices may have (polyhedra are planar, $3$-connected graphs). As an application, we recover the classification of planar Deza graphs.
  Next, we focus on the class of quartic polyhedral Deza graphs, and completely characterise it in terms of medial graphs of certain specific cubic polyhedra. Furthermore, within the aforementioned class of quartic polyhedral Deza graphs, we study the extremal graphs with respect to the ratio of number of triangular faces to the total. In the maximal extreme, these notably coincide with the class of line graphs of cubic polyhedra of girth $5$.
  We also fully characterise the quartic polyhedra of type $\{0,1,2,3\}$, and in particular we prove that none of them are medial graphs.
  On one hand our findings fit within the novel research area of common neighbours in graphs. On the other hand, our findings imply general properties of regular planar graphs and regular polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Configurations, Tessellations and Tone Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices denoting major chords and twelve black vertices denoting minor chords. This so-called Levi graph determines a configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in $\mathbb R^2$ with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four hexatonic cycles and the three octatonic cycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century harmony and voice leading, can be read off directly as properties of this configuration $\{12_3\}$ and its Levi graph. Analogous tone networks together with their Levi graphs and configurations can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music. These and other new tonnetze offer the promise of new methods of composition. If the constraints of the Eulerian tonnetz are relaxed so as to allow movements between major and minor triads with variations at exactly two tones, the resulting bipartite graph has two components, each generating a tessellation of the plane, of a type known to Kepler, based on hexagons, squares and dodecagons. When the same combinatorial idea is applied to tetrachords of the 'Tristan' genus (dominant sevenths and half-diminished sevenths) the cycles of the resulting bipartite graph are sufficiently ample in girth to ensure the existence of a second configuration $\{12_3\}$, distinct from the Eulerian tonnetz as an incidence geometry, which can be used for a new approach to the analysis of the rich tetradic harmonies of the nineteenth century common practice.</description>

      <title>The inducibility of Tur\'an graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $I(F,n)$ denote the maximum number of induced copies of a graph $F$ in an $n$-vertex graph. The inducibility of $F$, defined as $i(F)=\lim_{n\to \infty} I(F,n)/\binom{n}{v(F)}$, is a central problem in extremal graph theory. In this work, we investigate the inducibility of Tur\'an graphs $F$. This topic has been extensively studied in the literature, including works of Pippenger--Golumbic, Brown--Sidorenko, Bollob\'as--Egawa--Harris--Jin, Mubayi, Reiher, and the first author, and Yuster. Broadly speaking, these results resolve or asymptotically resolve the problem when the part sizes of $F$ are either sufficiently large or sufficiently small (at most four).
  We complete this picture by proving that for every Tur\'an graph $F$ and sufficiently large $n$, the value $I(F,n)$ is attained uniquely by the $m$-partite Tur\'an graph on $n$ vertices, where $m$ is given explicitly in terms of the number of parts and vertices of $F$. This confirms a conjecture of Bollob\'as--Egawa--Harris--Jin from 1995, and we also establish the corresponding stability theorem. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic analogue for $I_{k+1}(F,n)$, the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ in an $n$-vertex $K_{k+1}$-free graph, thereby completely resolving a recent problem of Yuster. Finally, our results extend to a broader class of complete multipartite graphs in which the largest and smallest part sizes differ by at most on the order of the square root of the smallest part size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For distinct real numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and distinct real numbers $b_1, \ldots, b_n$, consider the sum $S=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{\pi(i)}$ as $\pi$ ranges over the permutations of $[n]$. We show that this sum always assumes at least $\Omega(n^3)$ distinct values, which is optimal. This ``support'' bound complements recent work of Do, Nguyen, Phan, Tran, and Vu, and of Hunter, Pohoata, and Zhu on the anticoncentration properties of $S$ when $\pi$ is chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Uni-width subgroups, universal elements, and lambda number of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cyclic subgroup $N$ of a finite group $G$ is called a uni-width subgroup of $G$ if $N$ is the unique cyclic subgroup of $G$ of order $|N|$. In this article, we prove that a finite group $G$ admits a unique largest uni-width subgroup denoted by $U(1;G)$. We then show that the prime factors of the order of $U(1;G)$ influence the structure decomposition of its Fitting subgroup ${\mathrm{Fit}}(G)$. A power graph $\Gamma_G$ of a finite group is defined by $G$ being its set of vertices, and a pair of distinct elements $x,y \in G$ are connected by an edge if either $x \in \langle y \rangle$ or $y \in \langle x \rangle$. A universal element of a graph is a vertex that is adjacent to each of the remaining vertices. Our following result shows that a power graph $\Gamma_G$ of a finite non-trivial group admits a non-identity universal element if and only if it is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion $2$-group. The lambda number $\lambda(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is a measure of the least number of colors required for an $L(2,1)$-type of vertex coloring on $\Gamma_G$, which is known to be $\geq |G|$. Generalizing an earlier result, we then derive a necessary condition on a finite group $G$ such that $\lambda(G) = |G|$. Finally, we show that this result is best possible by exhibiting a family of groups without the necessary condition for which $\lambda(G) &gt; |G|$.</description>

      <title>Mixing times of a Burnside process Markov chain on set partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set and let $G$ be a finite group acting on $X$. The group action splits $X$ into disjoint orbits. The Burnside process is a Markov chain on $X$ which has a uniform stationary distribution when the chain is lumped to orbits. We consider the case where $X = [k]^n$ with $k \geq n$ and $G = S_k$ is the symmetric group on $[k]$, such that $G$ acts on $X$ by permuting the value of each coordinate. The resulting Burnside process gives a novel algorithm for sampling a set partition of $[n]$ uniformly at random. We obtain bounds on the mixing time and show that the chain is rapidly mixing. For the case $k &lt; n$, the algorithm corresponds to sampling a set partition of $[n]$ with at most $k$ blocks, and we obtain a mixing time bound which is independent of $n$. Along the way, we obtain explicit formulas for the transition probabilities and bounds on the second largest eigenvalue for both the original process and the lumped chain.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe some invariant Laurent polynomial rings, and resolve the questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita.</description>
