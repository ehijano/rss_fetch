      <title>Electron scale magnetic holes generation driven by Whistler-to-Bernstein mode conversion in fully kinetic plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic holes (MHs) are coherent structures characterized by a strong and localized magnetic field amplitude dip, commonly observed in the solar wind and planetary magnetosheaths. These structures come in different sizes, from magnetohydrodynamic to kinetic scales. Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) observations have revealed electron scale MHs to be ubiquitous in the turbulent Earth's magnetosheath, potentially playing an important role in the energy cascade and dissipation. Despite abundant observations, the origin of electron scale MHs is still unclear and debated. In this work, we use fully kinetic simulations to investigate the role of plasma turbulence in generating electron scale MHs. We perform a fully kinetic simulation of freely decaying plasma turbulence, initialized with typical Earth's magnetosheath parameters. We find that electron scale MHs can be generated by turbulence via the following mechanism: first, large-scale turbulent velocity shears produce regions with high electron temperature anisotropy; these localized regions become unstable, generating oblique electron scale whistler waves; as they propagate over the inhomogeneous turbulent background, whistler fluctuations develop an electrostatic component, turning into Bernstein-like modes; the strong electrostatic fluctuations produce current filaments that merge into an electron scale current vortex; the resulting electron vortex locally reduces the magnetic field amplitude, finally evolving into an electron scale MH. We show that MHs generated by this mechanism have properties consistent with MMS observations and nontrivial kinetic features. We provide numerical evidence of a new electron scale MH generation mechanism, driven by turbulence. Our results have potential implications for understanding the formation and occurrence of electron scale MHs in turbulent environments, such as the Earth's magnetosheath.</description>

      <title>Genesis of the James Webb Space Telescope Architecture: The Designers' Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, is an infrared observatory of novel design: deployable, with active optics, fully open to space for radiative cooling and orbiting the Lagrange point no. 2. This article explains the rationale leading to this specific design and describes the various other architectures that were considered along the way: from a monolithic 10-meter telescope in geosynchronous orbit to a 6-meter one in High Earth Orbit, then a 16-meter observatory on the Moon, a 4- or 6-meter one in an elliptical heliocentric orbit, and a segmented 8-meter one passively cooled to 50 K at L2, which was finally descoped to 6.6 meters. It also addresses the optimization for scientific performance, the challenge of dealing with such an ultra-low operating temperature, cost issues, supporting technology, modifications made during final design and, finally, how the architecture performs on orbit.</description>

      <title>New Insights on the High Reconnection Rate and the Diminishment of Ion Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered electron-only reconnection has drawn great interests due to abnormal features like lack of ion outflows and high reconnection rates. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate their physical mechanisms. The reconnection rate, when normalized by ion parameters ($R_i$), may appear anomalously high, whereas that normalized by electron parameters ($R_e$) remains ~0.1. We propose that the essence of high $R_i$ is insufficient field line bending outside the electron diffusion region, indicating an incomplete development of the ion diffusion region. It may result from bursty reconnection in thin current sheets, or small system sizes. The ion outflow diminishes at high $\beta_i$ when the gyroradius ($\rho_i$) exceeds the system size. Low-velocity ions still experience notable acceleration from Hall fields. However, a local distribution includes many high-velocity ions that experience random accelerations from different electric fields across $\rho_i$, resulting in near-zero bulk velocities. Our study helps understand reconnection structures and the underlying physics for transitions between different regimes.</description>
