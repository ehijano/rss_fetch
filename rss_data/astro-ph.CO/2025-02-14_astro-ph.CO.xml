      <title>Early Galaxies from Rare Inflationary Processes and JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop: Backreaction in the in-in formalism and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of axion dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a 'gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a generic quantum state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion particles comprising the solitonic core; for plausible parameter values, such a core is found to be in tension with the existence of the clockwise stellar disc at $2\sigma$ for $4.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.3\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

      <title>21-cm Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation after an Early Matter-Dominated Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although it is commonly assumed that relativistic particles dominate the energy density of the universe quickly after inflation, a variety of well-motivated scenarios predict an early matter-dominated era (EMDE) before the onset of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Subhorizon dark matter density perturbations grow faster during an EMDE than during a radiation-dominated era, leading to the formation of "microhalos" far earlier than in standard models of structure formation. This enhancement of small-scale structure boosts the dark-matter annihilation rate, which contributes to the heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compute how the dark matter annihilation rate evolves after an EMDE and forecast how well measurements of the 21-cm background can detect dark matter annihilation in cosmologies with EMDEs. We find that future measurements of the global 21-cm signal at a redshift of $z\sim 17$ are unlikely to improve on bounds derived from observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background, but measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum have the potential to detect dark matter annihilation following an EMDE. Moreover, dark matter annihilation and astrophysical X-rays produce distinct heating signatures in the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts around 14, potentially allowing differentiation between these two IGM heating mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization, Geodesic Equation and Sachs-Wolfe Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect with ACT and DESI Luminous Red Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scatter off the free-electron gas in galaxies and clusters, allowing us to use the CMB as a backlight to probe the gas in and around low-redshift galaxies. The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, sourced by hot electrons in high-density environments, measures the thermal pressure of the target objects, shedding light on halo thermodynamics and galaxy formation and providing a path toward understanding the baryon distribution around cosmic structures. We use a combination of high-resolution CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and photometric luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogues from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to measure the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in four redshift bins from $z=0.4$ to $z=1.2$, with a combined detection significance of 19$\sigma$ when stacking on the fiducial CMB Compton-$y$ map. We discuss possible sources of contamination, finding that residual dust emission associated with the target galaxies is important and limits current analyses. We discuss several mitigation strategies and quantify the residual modelling uncertainty. This work complements closely-related measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and weak lensing of the same galaxies.</description>

      <title>DESI dark secrets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first year results of DESI provide evidence that dark energy may not be quantum vacuum energy ($\Lambda$). If true, this would be an extraordinary development in the 25-year quest to understand cosmic acceleration. The best-fit DESI $w_0w_a$ models for dark energy, which underpin the claim, have very strange behavior. They achieve a maximum dark energy density around $z\simeq 0.4$ and rapidly decrease before and after. We explore physics-motivated models where the dark energy is a rolling scalar-field. Each of our four scalar-field models is characterized by one dimensionless parameter $\beta$, which in the limit of $\beta \rightarrow 0$ reduces to $\Lambda$CDM. While none of our models fit the DESI data significantly better than $\Lambda$CDM, for values of $\beta$ of order unity, they fit about as well as $\Lambda$CDM. Each scalar field model makes different predictions for the age of the Universe, which might be used to discriminate amongst them. For small values of $\beta$, the dimensionsless initial slope of the scalar field potential links the predictions of different scalar field models. And for small values of $\beta$, $w_0w_a$ models can marginally represent the predictions of a scalar-field model at the current precision needed. However, with increasingly precise distance measurements, over a larger redshift range, explicit modeling of the scalar-field evolution is already and will continue to be essential to testing alternatives to $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion dark matter gegenschein of the Vela supernova remnant with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are one of the leading dark matter candidates. If we are embedded in a Milky Way dark matter halo comprised of axions, their stimulated decay would enable us to observe a counterimage (``axion gegenschein") with a frequency equal to half the axion mass in the opposite direction of a bright radio source. This spectral line emission will be broadened to $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim \sigma_d/c \sim 10^{-3}$ due to the velocity dispersion of dark matter, $\sigma_d$. In this pilot study, we perform the first search for the expected axion gegenschein image of Vela supernova remnant (SNR) with 26.4 hours of effective ON-OFF data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) L-band (1.0 - 1.5~GHz) 19-beam receiver. Our null detection limits the axion-photon coupling strength to be $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ in the mass ranges of $8.7\,\mu\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 9.44\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ and $10.85\,\mu\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 12.01\,\mu\mathrm{eV} $. These results provide a stronger constraint on $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ in this axion mass range than the current limits obtained by the direct search of axion decay signal from galaxy clusters which uses FAST observations, but is a factor of $\sim 3$ times weaker than the current CAST limit.Based on our observation strategy, data processing methods, and results, the expected sensitivity will reach $\sim 10^{-11}\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ with $\sim 2000$ hours of observation in the future.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic modelling of Pop. III star formation and metallicity evolution - II. Impact on 21cm power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating Population (Pop.) III star formation in mini-halos in a large cosmological simulation is an extremely challenging task but it is crucial to estimate its impact on the 21cm power spectrum. In this work, we develop a framework within the semi-analytical code meraxes to estimate the radiative backgrounds from Pop. III stars needed for the computation of the 21cm signal. We computed the 21cm global signal and power spectrum for different Pop. III models varying star formation efficiency, initial mass function (IMF) and specific X-ray luminosity per unit of star formation (LX/SFR). In all the models considered, we find Pop. III stars have little to no impact on the reionization history but significantly affect the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to the strong injection of X-ray photons from their remnants that heat the neutral IGM at $z \geq$ 15. This is reflected not only on the 21cm sky-averaged global signal during the Cosmic Dawn but also on the 21cm power spectrum at $z \leq$ 10 where models with strong Pop. III X-ray emission have larger power than models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission. We estimate observational uncertainties on the power spectrum using 21cmsense and find that models where Pop. III stars have a stronger X-ray emission than Pop. II are distinguishable from models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission with 1000 hours observations of the upcoming SKA1-low.</description>

      <title>Foreground Removal in Ground-Based CMB Observations Using a Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) foreground removal based on deep learning techniques. This method employs a Transformer model, referred to as \texttt{TCMB}, which is specifically designed to effectively process HEALPix-format spherical sky maps. \texttt{TCMB} represents an innovative application in CMB data analysis, as it is an image-based technique that has rarely been utilized in this field. Using simulated data with noise levels representative of current ground-based CMB polarization observations, the \texttt{TCMB} method demonstrates robust performance in removing foreground contamination. The mean absolute variance for the reconstruction of the noisy CMB Q/U map is significantly less than the CMB polarization signal. To mitigate biases caused by instrumental noise, a cross-correlation approach using two half-mission maps was employed, successfully recovering CMB EE and BB power spectra that align closely with the true values, and these results validate the effectiveness of the \texttt{TCMB} method. Compared to the previously employed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach, the \texttt{TCMB} method offers two significant advantages: (1) It demonstrates superior effectiveness in reconstructing CMB polarization maps, outperforming CNN-based methods. (2) It can directly process HEALPix spherical sky maps without requiring rectangular region division, a step necessary for CNN-based approaches that often introduces uncertainties such as boundary effects. This study highlights the potential of Transformer-based models as a powerful tool for CMB data analysis, offering a substantial improvement over traditional CNN-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Accounting for motion of supernova host galaxy in statistical inference from SNIa data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of peculiar motion of Type Ia supernova host galaxies on cosmological parameter estimation. This motion causes their redshift to deviate from that of the comoving observer at their position and is a source of noise. To this end, we develop an estimator for parameter estimation in models with errors in independent variables. Using the Bayesian framework, errors in independent variables are treated as nuisance parameters by making the independent variables parameters of the model. Our method applied to the Pantheon sample of Type Ia supernova indicates a few percent shift in the central values of inferred cosmological parameters. For the $w$CDM model, we find that accounting for peculiar velocities makes the data marginally more consistent with the cosmological constant model. By using simulated data, we show that not accounting for peculiar velocities will significantly impact parameter estimation from higher precision future data sets.</description>

      <title>Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) Delineated in a Spectroscopic Survey. VIII. Revisiting the Lensing is Low Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of over-predicting the galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) signal using conventional galaxy-halo connection models has become well-known as the ``Lensing is Low'' problem, which has been extensively investigated using the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy samples. This issue is also tightly related to the so-called $S_8$ tension. By applying our Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) method to the BOSS survey and the DESI deep photometric survey, we obtained hundreds of cross-correlation measurements to establish an accurate galaxy-halo connection for BOSS galaxies through the halo abundance matching technique (Paper IV). With this galaxy-halo connection, we show in this work that the predicted GGL signals for BOSS galaxies both in the Planck and WMAP Universes actually agree very well with the GGL measurements. We find the best-fitting value $S_8 = 0.8294 \pm 0.0110$, $0.8073 \pm 0.0372$ and $0.8189 \pm 0.0440$ for the CMASS samples with the source galaxies from HSC, DES and KiDS image surveys, respectively. Our work indicates that accurate modeling of the lens population is so critical to interpret the GGL observation. For the scale of $r_p &lt; 0.6\,h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$, our GGL prediction for LOWZ samples are also in good agreement with the observations of HSC and DES. However, the GGL observation of KiDS is much lower on the small scale. Our results indicate that no significant baryon feedback is needed to suppress the small scale clustering unless the the GGL observation of KiDS on the small scale will be confirmed.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in the KiDS-1000 bright sample: dependence on colour, luminosity, morphology and galaxy scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is a major astrophysical contaminant to weak gravitational lensing measurements, and the study of its dependence on galaxy properties helps provide meaningful physical priors that aid cosmological analyses. This work studies for the first time the dependence of intrinsic alignments on galaxy structural parameters. We measure the intrinsic alignments of bright galaxies, selected on $r$-band magnitude $r&lt;20$, in the Kilo-Degree Survey. Machine-learning-based photometric redshift estimates are available for this galaxy sample that help obtain a clean measurement of its intrinsic alignment signal. We supplement this sample with a catalogue of structural parameters from S\'ersic profile fits to the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies. We split the sample in galaxy intrinsic colour, luminosity and S\'ersic index, and we fit the non-linear linear alignment model to galaxy position - shape projected correlation function measurements at large scales. We observe a power-law luminosity dependence of the large-scale intrinsic alignment amplitude, $A_\mathrm{IA}$, for both the red and high S\'ersic index ($n_s&gt;2.5$) samples, and find no significant difference between the two samples. We measure a $\sim1.5\sigma$ lower $A_\mathrm{IA}$ for red galaxies that also have a S\'ersic index $n_s&lt;4$, compared to the expected amplitude predicted using sample's luminosity. We also probe the intrinsic alignment of red galaxies as a function of galaxy scale by varying the radial weight employed in the shape measurement. We find no significant difference on large scales but on small scales, alignments increase with galaxy scale. For intrinsically blue galaxies, we find $A_\mathrm{IA}=-0.67\pm1.00$, consistent with previous works. We also find alignments to be consistent with zero for the low S\'ersic index ($n_s&lt;2.5$) sample.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Hamiltonian and Higher Loop Corrections in USR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the action and the interaction Hamiltonian at higher orders in cosmological perturbation theory is a cumbersome task. We employ the formalism of EFT of inflation in models of single field ultra slow-roll inflation and obtain a non-perturbative result for the Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$. To complete the dictionary, a non-linear relation between the curvature perturbations and $\pi$ is presented. Equipped with these non-linear results, we calculate the higher order loop corrections in USR models which are employed for PBHs formation. It is shown that the loop corrections on long CMB scales increase rapidly with the number of loop $L$ and the setup will go out of perturbative control at the four-loop level.</description>

      <title>Projecting Unequal Time Fields and Correlators of Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many large scale structure surveys sort their observations into redshift bins and treat every tracer as being located at the mean redshift of its bin, a treatment which we refer to as the equal time approximation. Recently, a new method was developed which allows for the estimation and correction of errors introduced by this approximation, which we refer to as the unequal time correlator-level projection. For single tracer power spectra, corrections arise at second order and above in a series expansion, with first order terms surviving only in multi-tracer analyses. In this paper we develop a new method which we refer to as the unequal time field level projection. This formalism projects the fields individually onto the celestial sphere, displaced from individual reference times, before defining their correlators. This method introduces new, first order correction terms even in the case of single tracer power spectra. Specifically, new first order terms are introduced which apply to both cross-bin and single bin correlators. All of these new corrections originate with derivatives over combinations of a delta function, a cross-bin phase term, and the power spectrum itself and stem from the introduction of two unequal time Fourier transforms into the analysis. We analyse these corrections in the context of a linearly biased power spectrum divided between two redshift bins and find that they can lead to non-trivial corrections, particularly to cross-bin correlators. We also show that these terms can be replicated by appropriately extending the correlator-level analysis to include a second Fourier transform which allows for a full redshift bin integration.</description>

      <title>Scale Invariant Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global scale-invariant Dark Energy model based on Induced Gravity with the addition of a small $R^2$ contribution is examined. The scalar field (quintessence), playing the role of Dark Energy, has a quartic potential and generates Newton's constant with its non-minimal coupling (after introducing a suitable symmetry breaking). Even when small, the $R^2$ contribution significantly modifies the cosmological evolution of the matter-gravity system. The solutions to this model are obtained analytically through a perturbative expansion and oscillate with transplanckian frequency. They are then compared with similar solutions found for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology plus $R^2$. Finally scalar field production is perturbatively taken into account in a simple model and the resulting effects illustrated.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of fresh gas on the Active Galactic Nuclei luminosity of early- and late-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main fuelling processes for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are currently unknown. Previous work showed that galaxies with a large kinematic misalignment between their stellar and gas reservoirs have a higher AGN fraction than galaxies without misalignment. Such misalignment is a strong indication of a past galaxy interaction or an external accretion event. In this work we use integral field spectroscopy data from the SAMI and MaNGA surveys to investigate the AGN luminosity as a function of kinematic misalignment angle. Our sample of AGN exhibit bolometric luminosities in the range 10^40 to 10^43 erg/s, indicative of low to moderate luminosity AGN. We find no correlation between AGN luminosity as a function of misalignment for AGN host galaxies from both surveys. We find some differences between the AGN luminosity of early- and late-type AGN host galaxies (ETGs, LTGs). AGN in LTG hosts have a wider luminosity range, with most LTG hosts showing aligned stellar to gas kinematics. AGN in ETG hosts have a luminosity range that does not depend on misalignment angle, suggesting AGN in ETG hosts are consistent with being fuelled by external accretion events, irrespective of their stellar to gas kinematic misalignment. While all the AGN in ETGs in our sample are consistent with being activated and fuelled by external gas, the range of observed AGN luminosities is likely caused by secondary factors such as the amount of fresh gas brought into the galaxy by the external interaction.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$ eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

      <title>Conversions in two-component dark sectors: a phase space level analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversions between the states in the dark sector affect not only their number densities but also their momentum distributions. In this work we study a phenomenologically motivated two-component dark matter scenario, based on the Coy Dark Matter model, in order to quantify the effect of conversions on departure from kinetic equilibrium and consequently the relic abundance. We perform a detailed numerical analysis at the level of the phase space distributions of dark sector particles, implementing all the relevant processes, including conversions, elastic scatterings and annihilations. Focusing on the parameter regions that lead to the observed relic abundance and provide a good fit to the Galactic Centre excess, we find that departure from kinetic equilibrium can alter the predictions for the total abundance by more than $100\%$, while in most of the interesting parameter space being in the range from around $-20\%$ to $50\%$. The effect on each dark matter constituent separately can be much larger, even up to an order of magnitude, which can significantly affect the expected present-day gamma ray flux, and consequently phenomenology of the model.</description>

      <title>Modeling spatially-resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission for galaxy clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopic surveys target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to probe cosmological scenarios. Understanding the clustering properties of ELGs is essential to derive optimal constraints. We present a simple radiative transfer model for spatially resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission, which includes emission from the warm-hot diffuse interstellar medium. The atomic level populations are in steady-state and computed in the coronal approximation. The model is applied to multiple IllustrisTNG simulations in the redshift range $1\leq z \leq 2$ to produce the luminosity function (LF) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD). Collisional processes account for a significant fraction of $\approx 40\%$ of the total ${\rm H}\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$). Our LFs are in reasonable agreement with measurements from H$\alpha$ surveys if a uniform extinction of $0.3&lt;A_{{\rm H}\alpha}&lt;0.85$ mag is assumed. Our HOD is consistent with that of the ${\it Euclid}$ Flagship galaxy mock up to differences that can be attributed to baryonic feedback, which is absent from the latter. When H$\alpha$ luminosities are computed from an empirical relation between $L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ and the total star formation rate (SFR) the resulting LFs are in tension with previous observations. Our approach can be extended to other atomic lines, which should be helpful for the mining of high-redshift galaxy spectra in forthcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Particle Flux in a Dynamically Self-consistent Milky Way Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed dynamically self-consistent model of the Milky Way constrained by observations from the Gaia observatory to include a radially anisotropic component in the dark matter (DM) halo, which represents the debris from the accreted Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) galaxy. In the new model, which we call a self-consistent Anisotropic Halo Model or scAHM, we derive distribution functions for DM velocity in heliocentric and geocentric reference frames. We compare them with the velocity distributions in the standard halo model (SHM) and another anisotropic model (SHM++). We compute predicted scattering rates in direct-detection experiments, for different target nuclei and DM particle masses. Seasonal dependencies of scattering rates are analyzed, revealing small but interesting variations in detection rates for different target nuclei and DM masses. Our findings show that the velocity distribution of the anisotropic GSE component significantly deviates from Gaussian, showing a modest impact on the detection rates. The peculiar kinematic signature of the radially anisotropic component would be most clearly observable by direction-sensitive detectors.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet-induced symmetry breaking/restoration during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of symmetry breaking or restoration that can occur in the middle of inflation due to the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term to a charged scalar. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling results in an inflaton-dependent effective squared mass of the charged scalar, which can change its sign (around the symmetric point) during inflation. This can lead to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, or to its restoration, if it is initially broken. We show the conditions under which the backreaction of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the inflationary background is negligible, such that the predictions of a given inflationary model are unaffected by the symmetry breaking/restoration process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the gravitational-wave (GW) strain upper limits from resolvable supermassive black-hole binaries using the data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), in the context of the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array project. We focus on circular orbits in the $\mu$Hz GW frequency band between $10^{-7}$ and $3\times10^{-6}$ Hz. This frequency band is higher than the traditional pulsar timing array band and is less explored. We used the data of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1713+5307 observed between August 2019 and April 2021. A dense observation campaign was carried out in September 2020 to allow for the $\mu$Hz band coverage. Our sky-average continuous source upper limit at the 95% confidence level at 1$\mu$Hz is 1.26$\times10^{-12}$, while the same limit in the direction of the pulsar is 4.77$\times10^{-13}$.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly test or measure weak gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at $6.5$m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of $1.8-2.7\,$eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.</description>

      <title>BOSS Constraints on Massive Particles during Inflation: The Cosmological Collider in Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive particles leave imprints on primordial non-Gaussianity via couplings to the inflaton, even despite their exponential dilution during inflation: practically, the Universe acts as a Cosmological Collider. We present the first dedicated search for spin-zero particles using BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, as well as Planck CMB non-Gaussianity data. We demonstrate that some Cosmological Collider models are well approximated by the standard equilateral and orthogonal parametrization; assuming negligible inflaton self-interactions, this facilitates us translating Planck non-Gaussianity constraints into bounds on Collider models. Many models have signatures that are not degenerate with equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianity and thus require dedicated searches. Here, we constrain such models using BOSS three-dimensional redshift-space galaxy clustering data, focusing on spin-zero particles in the principal series (i.e. with mass $m\geq 3H/2$) and constraining their couplings to the inflaton at varying speed and mass, marginalizing over the unknown inflaton self-interactions. This is made possible through an improvement in Cosmological Bootstrap techniques and the combination of perturbation theory and halo occupation distribution models for galaxy clustering. Our work sets the standard for inflationary spectroscopy with cosmological observations, providing the ultimate link between physics on the largest and smallest scales.</description>

Here we investigate how this standardisation is affected by the SN environment, with the aim to reduce scatter and improve standardisation. We first study the SN Ia stretch distribution, as well as its dependence on environment, as characterised by local and global (g-z) colour and stellar mass. We then look at the standardisation parameter $\alpha$, which accounts for the correlation between residuals and stretch, along with its environment dependence and linearity. We finally compute magnitude offsets between SNe in different astrophysical environments after colour and stretch standardisation, aka steps. This analysis is made possible due to the unprecedented statistics of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 volume-limited sample. The stretch distribution exhibits a bimodal behaviour, as previously found in literature. However, we find the distribution means to decrease with host stellar mass at a 9.2$\sigma$ significance. We demonstrate, at the 13.4$\sigma$ level, that the stretch-magnitude relation is non-linear, challenging the usual linear stretch-residuals relation. Fitting for a broken-$\alpha$ model, we indeed find two different slopes between stretch regimes ($x_1&lt;-0.48\pm0.08$): $\alpha_{low}=0.27\pm0.01$ and $\alpha_{high}=0.08\pm0.01$, a $\Delta_{\alpha}=-0.19\pm0.01$ difference. As the relative proportion of SNe Ia in the high-/low-stretch modes evolves with redshift and environment, this implies that a linear $\alpha$ also evolves with redshift and environment. Concerning the environmental magnitude offset $\gamma$, we find it to be greater than 0.12 mag regardless of the considered environmental tracer used (local or global colour and stellar mass), all measured at the $\geq 5\sigma$ level, increased to $\sim0.17\pm0.01$ mag when accounting for the stretch-non linearity.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of $k$-essence Model: Dynamical System Analysis and Observational Constraints from Latest Type Ia Supernova and BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of the $k$-essence scalar field model with inverse square and exponential potentials using data sets including Pantheon+SHOES and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from SDSS and DESI surveys, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter and redshift obtained from the differential age method (CC). We also provide a brief perspective on the dynamical evolution of both models and derive stability constraints on the model parameters, which are then used to set appropriate priors. We adopt a Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best fit the data. A comprehensive analysis in light of observational data shows that the $k$-essence model fits well across all data combinations. However, according to the BIC criterion, the $\Lambda$CDM model provides a slightly better fit compared to the $k$-essence model.</description>

      <title>Negative neutrino masses as a mirage of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses depend on prior physical assumptions about the mass spectrum. To test the accordance of cosmological and laboratory constraints in the absence of such priors, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter that extends consistently to negative values. For the $\Lambda$CDM model, we analyze data from Planck, ACT, and DESI and find a $2.8-3.3\sigma$ tension with the constraints from oscillation experiments. Motivated by recent hints of evolving dark energy, we analyze the $w_0w_a$ and mirage dark energy models, showing that they favour larger masses consistent with laboratory data, respectively $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.06_{-0.10}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.04_{-0.11}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ (both at 68%).</description>

      <title>The cosmic trimmer: Black-hole hair in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is altered by cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static black holes in general relativity modified by a linear scalar coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant always carry hair. We show that the same mechanism that creates the hair makes it incompatible with a cosmological horizon. Other scalar-tensor models do not have this problem when time dependence of the scalar provides a natural matching to cosmology. Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is particularly rigid, and such a scenario does not help. An extra operator makes the theory behave like the other models, and the cosmological horizon can be accommodated. The hair, however, is drastically altered.</description>

      <title>Probing flavored regimes of leptogenesis with gravitational waves from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings radiate detectable gravitational waves in models featuring high-scale symmetry breaking, e.g., high-scale leptogenesis. In this Letter, for the first time, we show that different flavored regimes of high-scale leptogenesis can be tested with the spectral features in cosmic string-radiated gravitational waves. This is possible if the scalar field that makes right-handed neutrinos massive is feebly coupled to the Standard Model Higgs. Each flavored regime, sensitive to low-energy neutrino experiments, leaves a marked imprint on the gravitational waves spectrum. A three-flavor and a two-flavor regime could be probed by a characteristic fall-off of the gravitational wave spectrum at the LISA-DECIGO-ET frequency bands with preceding scale-invariant amplitudes bounded from above and below. We present Gravitational Waves windows for Flavored Regimes of Leptogenesis (GWFRL) testable in the upcoming experiments. We also provide the first construction of a leptogenesis framework where a testable distinction of flavor regimes is possible without constraining the flavor structure of the theory.</description>

      <title>The properties of magnetised cold filaments in a cool-core galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filaments of cold gas ($T\leq 10^{4}$ K) are found in the inner regions of many cool-core clusters. These structures are thought to play a major role in the regulation of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We study the morphology of the filaments, their formation, and their impact on the propagation of the outflowing AGN jets. We present a set of GPU-accelerated 3D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster using the performance portable code AthenaPK. We include radiative cooling, and a self-regulated AGN feedback model that redistributes accreted material through kinetic, thermal and magnetic feedback. We confirm that magnetic fields play an important role in both the formation and evolution of the cold material. These suppress the formation of massive cold discs and favour magnetically supported filaments over clumpy structures. Achieving resolutions of $25-50$ pc, we find that filaments are not monolithic as they contain numerous and complex magnetically supported sub-structures. We find that the mass distribution of these clumps follows a $\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}M \propto M^{-1.6}$ power-law for all investigated filaments. Studying the evolution of individual filaments, we find that their formation pathways can be diverse. We find examples of filaments forming through a combination of gas uplifting and condensation, as well as systems of purely infalling clumps condensing out of the intracluster medium. The density contrast between the cold gas and the outflowing hot material leads to recurring deflections of the jets, favouring inflation of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Dancing with invisible partners: Three-body exchanges with primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundance of massive primordial black holes has historically been constrained by dynamical probes. Since these objects can participate in hard few-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar systems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is not the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black holes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a binary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case, the remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an invisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial black holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for detecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the Solar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary systems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>QCD-sourced tachyonic phase transition in a supercooled Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel gravitational wave production mechanism in the context of quasi-conformal Standard Model extensions, which provide a way to dynamically generate the electroweak scale. In these models, the cosmic thermal history is modified by a substantial period of thermal inflation, potentially supercooling the Universe below the QCD scale. The exit from supercooling is typically realized through a strong, first-order phase transition. By employing the classically conformal $U(1)_{\tiny\rm B-L}$ model as a representative example, we show that a large parameter space exists where bubble percolation is inefficient. In this case, the top quark condensate triggers a tachyonic phase transition driven by classical rolling of the new scalar field towards the true vacuum. As the field crosses a region where its effective mass is negative, long-wavelength scalar field fluctuations are exponentially amplified, preheating the supercooled Universe. We study the dynamics of this scenario and estimate the peak of the associated gravitational wave signal, which is detectable by future observatories in almost the entire available parameter space.</description>

      <title>The Blending ToolKit: A simulation framework for evaluation of galaxy detection and deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an open source Python library for simulating overlapping (i.e., blended) images of galaxies and performing self-consistent comparisons of detection and deblending algorithms based on a suite of metrics. The package, named Blending Toolkit (BTK), serves as a modular, flexible, easy-to-install, and simple-to-use interface for exploring and analyzing systematic effects related to blended galaxies in cosmological surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). BTK has three main components: (1) a set of modules that perform fast image simulations of blended galaxies, using the open source image simulation package GalSim; (2) a module that standardizes the inputs and outputs of existing deblending algorithms; (3) a library of deblending metrics commonly defined in the galaxy deblending literature. In combination, these modules allow researchers to explore the impacts of galaxy blending in cosmological surveys. Additionally, BTK provides researchers who are developing a new deblending algorithm a framework to evaluate algorithm performance and make principled comparisons with existing deblenders. BTK includes a suite of tutorials and comprehensive documentation. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/BlendingToolKit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories are promising dark energy models. A promising scalar-tensor theory, called Horndeski-like gravity, is coming from the application of the Horndeski gravity in string theory and cosmology that takes into account two dilaton fields. In this work we study the stability of the scalar sector of this theory and compare it with that coming from the previously studied tensor sector. With the first-order formalism we investigate the allowed background solutions. Focusing on the background solution with a single scalar field, the entropy coming from particle production $S_{in}$ and that of the apparent horizon $S$ will be studied, which translates into \textit{entropy bounds}. These entropy bounds are compared with the stability of the scalar and tensor sector as well. The gravitational slip (minus one) to entropy ratio is also considered as a possible replacement for the usual shear viscosity to entropy ratio for black holes.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 I: X-ray exploration of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.32^{+0.29}_{-0.25}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.62^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-loop corrections (1LC) to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations arising from cubic interactions in the single-field E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole (PBH) production are numerically calculated. The results demonstrate the 1LC contributes merely a few percent to the tree-level power spectrum. The model parameters are chosen to predict the PBH masses in the asteroid-mass range, while maintaining consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations within 1$\sigma$ confidence levels, and obeying the upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. The PBHs formed on scales smaller than the inflation scale can constitute a significant fraction of the present dark matter (DM). The PBH-induced gravitational waves (GW) may be detectable by the future space-based gravitational interferometers. We also consider a reconstruction of the scalar potential from possible GW observations and present a numerical approach tested in the model parameter space.</description>

      <title>Extended Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: Ghost Condensate Dark Energy with Sextic Dispersion Relation in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>

Abstract: We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.</description>
