      <title>A graph theoretic model for the derived categories of gentle algebras and their homological bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a simple model for the bounded derived category of gentle algebras in terms of marked ribbon graphs and their walks, in order to analyze indecomposable objects, Auslander-Reiten triangles and homological bilinear forms, and to provide some relevant derived invariants in a graph theoretic setting. Among others, we exhibit the non-negativity and Dynkin type of the homological quadratic form of a gentle algebra, describe its roots as the classes of indecomposable perfect complexes in the Grothendieck group, and express its Coxeter polynomial in terms of the Avella-Alaminos Geiss invariant. We also derive some consequences for Brauer graph algebras.</description>

      <title>The stable category of Gorenstein-projective modules over a monomial algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be an arbitrary monomial algebra. We investigate the stable category $\underline{\operatorname{Gproj}}^{\mathbb{Z}}\Lambda$ of graded Gorenstein-projective $\Lambda$-modules and the orbit category $\underline{\operatorname{Gproj}}^{\mathbb{Z}} \Lambda/(1)$ induced by $\underline{\operatorname{Gproj}}^{\mathbb{Z}}\Lambda$ and the degree shift functor $(1)$. We prove that $\underline{\operatorname{Gproj}}^{\mathbb{Z}}\Lambda$ is triangle equivalent to the bounded derived category of a path algebra of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$ and that $\underline{\operatorname{Gproj}}^{\mathbb{Z}}\Lambda/(1)$ is triangle equivalent to the stable module category of a self-injective Nakayama algebra. Both the path algebra and the self-injective Nakayama algebra will be given explicitly. The latter result provides an explicit description of the stable category of (ungraded) Gorenstein-projective $\Lambda$-modules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with computing the cohomology of Schur functors applied to tautological bundles on super Grassmannians. We show that in a range of cases, the cohomology is a free module over the cohomology of the structure sheaf and that the space of generators is an irreducible representation of the general linear supergroup that can be constructed via explicit multilinear operations. Our techniques come from commutative algebra: we relate this cohomology calculation to Tor groups of certain algebraic varieties.</description>

      <title>Projective Modules and Cohomology for Integral Basic Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebras defined over fields of characteristic zero and positive characteristic usually do not behave the same way. However, for certain algebras, for example the group algebras, they behave the same way as the characteristic zero case at good enough prime. In this paper, we initiate the study of this topic by imposing increasingly strong hypotheses on basic algebras. When the algebras satisfy the right hypotheses, we have equalities of the dimensions of their cohomology groups between simple modules and equalities of graded Cartan numbers. The examples include the Solomon descent algebras of finite Coxeter groups at large enough primes, nil-Coxeter algebra, and certain finite semigroup algebras at an arbitrary prime.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Biderivations on Complex Semisimple Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies biderivations on finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras to their finite-dimensional modules. More precisely, we prove that all such symmetric biderivations are trivial. As applications, we determine all biderivations on Takiff algebras and symplectic oscillator algebras, as well as all supersymmetric biderivations over some Lie superalgebras including all finite-dimensional classical simple Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>The Magic and Mystery of Component Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over the complex field $\mathbb C$, $P$ a parabolic subgroup containing $B$ its Borel subgroup, $P'$ its derived group and $\mathfrak m$ the Lie algebra of its nilradical. The nilfibre $\mathscr N$ for this action is the zero locus of the augmentation $\mathscr I_+$ of the semi-invariant algebra $\mathscr I=\mathbb C[\mathfrak m]^{P'}$. For $G=SL(n)$ practically nothing was known previously. The only result of comparable, but lesser complexity, is for $\mathscr V:=\mathscr O\cap \mathfrak n$, with $\mathscr O$ a nilptent $G$ orbit and $\mathfrak n$ the set of strictly upper triangular matrices. Then $\mathscr V$ is equidimensional with components known as orbital varieties, parameterised by standard tableaux whose shape is dictated by $\mathscr O$. Here the components of $\mathscr N$ are studied for $G=SL(n)$. They increase exponentially in $n$ with no a priori discernable pattern. For each choice of numerical data $\mathcal C$, a semi-standard tableau $\mathscr T^\mathcal C$, is constructed from $\mathscr T$. A \textit{delicate and tightly interlocking} analysis constructs a set of excluded root vectors from $\mathfrak m$ such that the complementary space $\mathfrak u^\mathcal C$ has the following properties. First it is a subalgebra of $\mathfrak m$. Secondly $\mathscr C:=\overline{B.\mathfrak u^\mathcal C}$ lies in $\mathscr N$ to which, thirdly, a Weierstrass section can be associated. Fourthly $\dim \mathscr C = dim \mathfrak m-\textbf{g}$, where \textbf{g} is the number of generators of the polynomial algebra $\mathscr I$. Fifthly the Weierstrass section, is shown to imply that $\mathscr C$ an irreducible component of $\mathscr N$, yet $\mathscr C$ is \textit{ only sometimes} an orbital variety closure. The resulting Component Map $\mathscr T^\mathcal C\mapsto\mathscr C$ is shown to be injective. Evidence for its surjectivity is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Braiding on complex oriented Soergel bimodules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study U(n) Soergel bimodules in the context of stable homotopy theory. We define the $(\infty, 1)$-category $\mathrm{SBim}_E(n)$ of $E$-valued U(n) Soergel bimodules, where $E$ is a connective $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring spectrum, and assemble them into a monoidal locally additive $(\infty, 2)$-category $\mathrm{SBim}_E$. When $E$ has a complex orientation, we then construct a braiding, i.e. an $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure, on the universal locally stable $(\infty, 2)$-category $\mathrm{K}^b_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathrm{SBim}_E)$ associated to $\mathrm{SBim}_E$. Along the way, we also prove spectral analogs of standard splittings of Soergel bimodules. This is a topological generalization of the type $A$ Soergel bimodule theory developed in a previous paper.</description>

      <title>Algebraic cycles and Hitchin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study motivic aspects of the Hitchin system for $\mathrm{GL}_n$. Our results include the following. (a) We prove the motivic decomposition conjecture of Corti-Hanamura for the Hitchin system; in particular, the decomposition theorem associated with the Hitchin system is induced by algebraic cycles. This yields an unconditional construction of the motivic perverse filtration for the Hitchin system, which lifts the cohomological/sheaf-theoretic perverse filtration. (b) We prove that the inverse of the relative Hard Lefschetz symmetry is induced by a relative algebraic correspondence, confirming the relative Lefschetz standard conjecture for the Hitchin system. (c) We show a strong perversity bound for the normalized Chern classes of a universal bundle with respect to the motivic perverse filtration; this specializes to the sheaf-theoretic result obtained earlier by Maulik-Shen. (d) We prove a $\chi$-independence result for the relative Chow motives associated with Hitchin systems.
  Our methods combine Fourier transforms for compactified Jacobian fibrations associated with integral locally planar curves, nearby and vanishing cycle techniques, and a Springer-theoretic interpretation of parabolic Hitchin moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Complex and rational hypergeometric functions on root systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider some new limits for the elliptic hypergeometric integrals on root systems. After the degeneration of elliptic beta integrals of type I and type II for root systems $A_n$ and $C_n$ to the hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals, we apply the limit $\omega_1\to - \omega_2$ for their quasiperiods (corresponding to $b\to i$ in the two-dimensional conformal field theory) and obtain complex beta integrals in the Mellin--Barnes representation admitting exact evaluation. Considering type I elliptic hypergeometric integrals of a higher order obeying nontrivial symmetry transformations, we derive their descendants to the level of complex hypergeometric functions and prove the Derkachov--Manashov conjectures for functions emerging in the theory of non-compact spin chains. We describe also symmetry transformations for a type II complex hypergeometric function on the $C_n$-root system related to the recently derived generalized complex Selberg integral. For some hyperbolic beta integrals we consider a special limit $\omega_1\to \omega_2$ (or $b\to 1$) and obtain new hypergeometric identities for sums of integrals of rational functions.</description>

      <title>Level one automorphic representations of an anisotropic exceptional group over $\mathbb{Q}$ of type $\mathrm{F}_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Up to isomorphism, there is a unique connected semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$ of Lie type $\mathrm{F}_{4}$, with compact real points and split over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ for all primes $p$. Let $\mathbf{F}_{4}$ be such a group. In this paper, we study the level one automorphic representations of $\mathbf{F}_{4}$ in the spirit of the work of Chenevier, Renard, and Ta\"ibi. First, we give an explicit formula for the number of these representations having any given archimedean component. For this, we study the automorphism group of the two definite exceptional Jordan algebras of rank $27$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ studied by Gross, as well as the dimension of the invariants of these groups in all irreducible representations of $\mathbf{F}_{4}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, assuming standard conjectures by Arthur and Langlands for $\mathbf{F}_{4}$, we refine this counting by studying the contribution of the representations whose global Arthur parameter has any possible image (or "Sato-Tate group"). This includes a detailed description of all those images, as well as precise statements for the Arthur's multiplicity formula in each case. As a consequence, we obtain a conjectural but explicit formula for the number of algebraic, cuspidal, level one automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_{26}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with Sato-Tate group $\mathbf{F}_{4}(\mathbb{R})$ of any given weight (assumed "$\mathrm{F}_{4}$-regular"). The first example of such representations occurs in motivic weight $36$.</description>

Abstract: This paper surveys some recent results, concerning the intrinsicness of natural subcategories of weakly approximable triangulated subcategories. We also review the results about uniqueness of enhancements of triangulated categories, with the aim of showing the fruitful interplay. In particular, we show how this leads to a vast generalization of a result by Rickard about derived invariance for schemes and rings.</description>

      <title>An Intersection Matrix for Affine Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a real affine hyperplane arrangement, we define an integer intersection matrix with a natural $q$-deformation related to the intersections of bounded chambers of the arrangement. By connecting the integer matrix to a bilinear form of Schechtman-Varchenko, we show that there is a closed formula for its determinant that only depends on the combinatorics of the underlying matroid. We conjecture an analogous formula for its $q$-deformation. Our work also applies more generally in the setting of affine oriented matroids.
  Additionally, we give a representation-theoretic interpretation of our $q$-intersection matrix using Braden-Licata-Proudfoot-Websters's hypertoric category $\mathcal{O}$ (or more generally Kowalenko-Mautner's category $\mathcal{O}$ for oriented matroid programs). This paper is part of a broader program to categorify matroidal Schur algebras defined by Braden-Mautner.</description>

      <title>Cocycles for Kottwitz cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his work on defining the pointed set B(G) for all local and global fields, Kottwitz introduced certain Galois gerbes and considered their 'algebraic' cohomology with values in algebraic groups. However, the gerbes so constructed are only canonical up to conjugation by their bands. This is enough in order to ensure that the cohomology set B(G) is canonical, but not enough data to pin down the set of algebraic cocycles used to compute the set B(G). For arithmetic applications it is often desirable to have the finer control provided by these cocycles readily at hand. To this end we propose in this paper a framework with which to work with such spaces of algebraic Kottwitz cocycles. This will play a crucial role in our forthcoming work on the formalism of Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of a root groupoid as a replacement of the notion of Weyl group for (Kac-Moody) Lie superalgebras. The objects of the root groupoid classify certain root data, the arrows are defined by generators and relations. As an abstract groupoid the root groupoid has many connected components and we show that to some of them one can associate an interesting family of Lie superalgebras which we call root superalgebras. We classify root superalgebras satisfying some additional assumptions. To each root groupoid component we associate a graph (called skeleton) generalizing the Cayley graph of the Weyl group. We establish the Coxeter property of the skeleton generalizing in this way the fact that the Weyl group of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra is Coxeter.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Fourier-Deligne transforms on G/U and the algebra of braids and ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly identify the algebra generated by symplectic Fourier-Deligne transforms (i.e. convolution with Kazhdan-Laumon sheaves) acting on the Grothendieck group of perverse sheaves on the basic affine space $G/U$, answering a question originally raised by A. Polishchuk. We show it is isomorphic to a distinguished subalgebra, studied by I. Marin, of the generalized algebra of braids and ties (defined in Type $A$ by F. Aicardi and J. Juyumaya and generalized to all types by Marin), providing a connection between geometric representation theory and an algebra defined in the context of knot theory. Our geometric interpretation of this algebra entails some algebraic consequences: we obtain a short and type-independent geometric proof of the braid relations for Juyumaya's generators of the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra (previously proved case-by-case in types $A, D, E$ by Juyumaya and separately for types $B, C, F_4, G_2$ by Juyumaya and S. S. Kannan), a natural candidate for an analogue of a Kazhdan-Lusztig basis, and finally an explicit formula for the dimension of Marin's algebra in Type $A_n$ (previously only known for $n \leq 4$).</description>

      <title>Presentations of Schur and Specht modules in characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New presentations of Specht modules of symmetric groups over fields of characteristic zero have been obtained by Brauner, Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs. These involve generators that are column tabloids and relations that are Garnir relations with maximal number of exchanges between consecutive columns or symmetrization of Garnir relations with minimal number of exchanges between consecutive columns. In this paper, we examine Garnir relations and their symmetrization with any number of exchanges. In both cases, we provide sufficient arithmetic conditions so that the corresponding quotient is a Specht module. In particular, in the first case this yields new presentations of Specht modules if the parts of the conjugate partition that correspond to maximal number of exchanges greater than 1 are distinct. These results generalize the presentations mentioned above and offer an answer to a question of Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs. Our approach is via representations of the general linear group.</description>

      <title>A D-module approach to invariant distributions with finitely many orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tauchi provides an example illustrating the action of a real algebraic subgroup $H$ of $GL(2n, \mathbb{R})$ with finitely many orbits on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, while the dimension of the space of relative $H$-invariant distributions on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is infinite. We offer a perspective on this example from the viewpoint of D-modules, where we explicitly determine the simple quotient regular holonomic D-modules and demonstrate that the distributions exhibit an enlarged symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using ideas of Sansuc and results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and of Tate, we compute the defect of weak approximation for a reductive group G over a global field K in terms of the algebraic fundamental group of G.</description>

      <title>Deformation of the heat kernel and the Brownian motion from the perspective of the Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</description>

      <title>GL-algebras in positive characteristic I: the exterior algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the category of GL-equivariant modules over the infinite exterior algebra in positive characteristic. Our main structural result is a shift theorem a la Nagpal. Using this, we obtain a Church--Ellenberg type bound for the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity. We also prove finiteness results for local cohomology.</description>
