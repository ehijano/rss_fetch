      <title>Scaling to 32 GPUs on a Novel Composable System Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of composable systems architecture marks a significant shift in resource allocation and utilization within data centers. This paper presents a composable architecture scaling up to 32 GPUs on a single node, addressing the technical challenges encountered and the innovative solutions implemented. This design introduces a flexible and dynamic resource distribution mechanism, particularly for GPUs, enabling tailored allocation to meet varying node demands. The architecture's dynamic nature allows for the flexible assignment and reassignment of hardware resources, such as GPUs, to different nodes as required, offering unprecedented capability and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Privacy and Security of Women's Reproductive Health Apps in a Changing Legal Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FemTech, a rising trend in mobile apps, empowers women to digitally manage their health and family planning. However, privacy and security vulnerabilities in period-tracking and fertility-monitoring apps present significant risks, such as unintended pregnancies and legal consequences. Our approach involves manual observations of privacy policies and app permissions, along with dynamic and static analysis using multiple evaluation frameworks. Our research reveals that many of these apps gather personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive healthcare data. Furthermore, our analysis identifies that 61% of the code vulnerabilities found in the apps are classified under the top-ten Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) vulnerabilities. Our research emphasizes the significance of tackling the privacy and security vulnerabilities present in period-tracking and fertility-monitoring mobile apps. By highlighting these crucial risks, we aim to initiate a vital discussion and advocate for increased accountability and transparency of digital tools for women's health. We encourage the industry to prioritize user privacy and security, ultimately promoting a safer and more secure environment for women's health management.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuit Design with a Standard Cell Approach, with an Application to Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design quantum circuits by using the standard cell approach borrowed from classical circuit design, which can speed-up the layout of circuits with a regular structure. Our standard cells are general and can be used for all types of quantum circuits: error-corrected or not. The standard cell approach enables the formulation of layout-aware routing algorithms. Our method is directly applicable to neutral atom quantum computers supporting qubit shuttling. Such computers enable zoned architectures for memory, processing and measurement, and we design circuits using qubit storages (memory and measurement zones) and standard cells (processing zones). Herein, we use cubic standard cells for Toffoli gates and, starting from a 3D architecture, we design a multiplication circuit. We present evidence that, when compared with automatic routing methods, our layout-aware routers are significantly faster and achieve shallower 3D circuits (by at least 2.5x) and with a lower routing cost. Additionally, our co-design approach can be used to estimate the resources necessary for a quantum computation without using complex compilation methods. We conclude that standard cells, with the support of layout-aware routing, pave the way to very large scale methods for quantum circuit compilation.</description>
