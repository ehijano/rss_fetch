      <title>From a Different Star: 3I/ATLAS in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'), provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity suggests an origin within the Milky Way's thick disk, making it the first ISO from this population, and predicts a high water mass fraction, which may become observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24fw: Candidate circumplanetary disk occultation of a main-sequence star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05367v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty disks around planets in outer reaches of exo-planetary systems can be detected as long-lasting occultations, provided the observer is close to the planet's orbital plane. Here we report follow-up observations of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. Using optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S), we find strong Na I D absorption indicating that the occulter is gas rich. We detect multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion &lt;10 km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/s with respect to the system, which likely originate in the occulter, as well as blue-shifted and broad (200 km/s) Halpha line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. Assuming that the occulter is a circumplanetary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we derive the planet's mass of 0.5-19 MJupiter and a circumplanetary disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star (&gt;2 Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and is more likely to be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and metal emission lines originate in the circumplanetary disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a planet-driven wind or of circumsecondary disk rotation.</description>

      <title>Modelling the 3D atmospheric structure of the cold Jupiter WD1856+534b orbiting a white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WD-1856b+534b (WD-1856b) is to date the only detected cold Jupiter outside of our Solar System. This cold Jupiter can provide useful information about the cold giants in our Solar System. Recent JWST observations have targeted WD-1856b, with more scheduled in the near future. To support the interpretation of these observations, we simulated WD-1856b using a three-dimensional (3D) General Circulation Model (GCM) and produced synthetic emission spectra of the planet. We used the Exo-FMS GCM with correlated-k radiative transfer (RT) and mixing-length theory (MLT). In addition, we included abundances of 13 chemical species using the thermochemical kinetic model mini-chem. Because there are substantial uncertainties in the metallicity and internal temperature of WD-1856b, we ran simulations with 1x, 10x, and 100x solar compositions and at low and high internal temperatures (100 K and 500 K). We generated emission spectra and brightness temperature curves with the GCM output using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative-transfer code gCMCRT. Our results suggest larger volume mixing ratios (VMR) of CO and \CO2 with a warmer core at higher metallicity. With a colder core, H2O and CH4 become more relevant and increase to 0.01 VMR at 100x Solar. We suggest possible \H2O cloud formation in the upper atmosphere in the warm 100x solar case and in all cold cases, which may reduce gas phase H2O in the upper atmosphere moderately.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Cuboid Particle Scattering on Reflected Light Phase Curves: Insights from Laboratory Data and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the optical properties of exoplanet cloud particles is a top priority. Many cloud condensates form as nonspherical particles and their optical properties can be very different from those of spheres. In this study, we focus on KCl particles, which likely form as cuboids in warm (T=500-1000K) exoplanet atmospheres. We compare the phase functions (at 532 nm wavelength) of KCl particles computed with Mie theory, the two-term Henyey-Greenstein (TTHG) approximation, laboratory data, and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). Mie theory assumes scattering from spheres, while TTHG functions are used to approximate cloud scattering in two-stream radiative transfer models like PICASO. Laboratory measurements and DDA allow for a robust understanding of scattering from cuboid and deformed cuboid particle shapes. We input these phase functions into PICASO using cloud distributions from the cloud model Virga, to determine how different phase functions can impact the reflected-light intensities of the benchmark sub-Neptune, GJ 1214b. Simulated reflected light phase curves of GJ1214b produced using the TTHG, laboratory, and DDA phase curves differ by less than 3ppm. Our findings suggest that TTHG phase functions may be useful for approximating the scattering intensity of certain cuboid and irregular particle shapes. Future work should expand upon the wavelengths and particles considered to better determine when scattering approximations, like TTHG, may be useful in lieu of more accurate, but time-consuming laboratory measurements and/or nonspherical scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Investigating the extent of bladed terrain on Pluto via photometric surface roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's New Horizons spacecraft discovered fields of sub-parallel sets of steep ridges situated in the high-altitude, low-latitude regions in Pluto's encounter hemisphere called 'bladed terrain'. Thought to be formed due to sublimational erosion of methane ice, bladed terrain represents an active response of Pluto's landscape to current and past climates. The observation of a strong methane signature within the low latitudes of Pluto's non-encounter hemisphere points to the possibility that this terrain type is also present there. To test this hypothesis, in the absence of high resolution images of Pluto's non-encounter hemisphere, we employ photometric analysis of the methane rich regions. We specifically focus on determining the macroscopic surface roughness in selected images, whose photometric-effect can be apparent even in low-resolution images. We employ the `crater-roughness' photometric model of Buratti &amp; Veverka (1985), which assumes that the surface is covered with parabolic depressions defined by a depth-to-radius ratio parameter $q$ (higher $q$ values correspond to rougher surfaces). Despite the high uncertainty in the retrieved roughness values from our analysis, we can safely conclude that the hypothesized bladed terrain region on the non-encounter hemisphere of Pluto is very rough ($q = 0.47_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$, 2$\sigma$), with the median roughness more than twice that of other broad regions of Pluto studied in this work, including the encounter-hemisphere bladed terrain region ($q = 0.21_{-0.18}^{+0.08}$, 2$\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Numerical Validation of the Yarkovsky Effect in Super-Fast Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries show that asteroids spinning in less than a few minutes undergo sizeable semi-major-axis drifts, possibly driven by the Yarkovsky effect. Analytical formulas can match these drifts only if very low thermal inertia is assumed, implying a dust-fine regolith or a highly porous interior that is difficult to retain under such extreme centrifugal forces. With analytical theories of the Yarkovsky effect resting on a set of assumptions, their applicability to cases of super-fast rotation should be verified. We aim to evaluate the validity of the analytical models in such scenarios and to determine whether the Yarkovsky effect can explain the observed drift in rapidly rotating asteroids. We have developed a numerical model of the Yarkovsky effect tailored to super-fast rotators. The code resolves micrometre-scale thermal waves on millisecond time steps, capturing the steep gradients that arise when surface thermal inertia is extremely low. A new 3-D heat-conduction and photon-recoil solver is benchmarked against the THERMOBS thermophysical code and the analytical solution of the Yarkovsky effect, over a range of rotation periods and thermal conductivities. The analytical Yarkovsky drift agrees well with the numerical solver. For thermal conductivities from $0.0001$ to $1$ $\mathrm{Wm^{-1}K^{-1}}$ and spin periods as short as 10 s, the two solutions differ by no more than $15\%$. Applied to the 34-s rapid rotator 2016 GE1, the best match of the measured drift is obtained with $\Gamma\lesssim20$ $\mathrm{Jm^{-2}K^{-1}s^{-1/2}}$, a value that implies $\sim100$ K temperature swings each spin cycle. This confirms that the observed semi-major axis drifts for super-fast rotators can be explained by the Yarkovsky effect and very low thermal inertia, which might point to rapid thermal fatigue as a regolith-generation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS" [arXiv:2507.02757]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05881v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows a weak cometary activity. Its brightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid with an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would amount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass budget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection rate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core radius &lt;0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density &lt;5x10^{-8}au^{-3} for R&gt;10km. The second possibility would suggest that the rare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner solar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate.</description>

      <title>Rotation dynamics and torque efficiency of cometary nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a rigid cometary nucleus is described by the evolutions of its center-of-mass and of its rotation state. Solar irradiation that reaches the surface of a cometary nucleus causes the sublimation of volatiles that form the coma around the nucleus. The sublimation process transfers linear momentum and rotational angular momentum from the nucleus to the surrounding space, and thus affects the dynamics via nongravitational forces and nongravitational torques. The 2014-2016 Rosetta mission accompanying the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko provides the longest continuous observational data to track its rotation state. The observed change in the rotation state is not explained by a low heat conductivity thermophysical model in combination with a homogeneous surface ice coverage of comet 67P. Spatially and/or temporally varying weights for effective active fraction with respect to a prescribed set of surface regions provide a potential solution to this problem. Here, we present a methodology for classifying the surface based on vectorial efficiency of the torque. On any cometary surface without geometric symmetry, the methodology highlights the decomposition into eight characteristic regions that encode the signs of torque efficiency with respect to all vector components. We analyze in detail rotation states close to lowest energy and different thermophysical models, and we discuss how the uncertainties of observations affect the model parameters. We study the occurrence of these regions for an oblate ellipsoid, a near-prolate ellipsoid, a bilobed shape, and a shape model analogous to that of comet 67P. The sensitivity analysis for comet 67P indicates that the observations constrain only one of the eight weights uniquely. The other directions are poorly constrained and show the limitation of the rotational data in determining regional activity.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Method for Constraining the Capability of the Habitable Worlds Observatory to Understand Ozone Onset Time in Earth Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere 2.3 billion years ago, which on exoplanets is expected to be most detectable via the UV ozone feature at $\sim$0.25 $\mu$m, is often regarded as a sign of the emergence of photosynthetic life. On exoplanets, we may similarly expect life to oxygenate the atmosphere, but with a characteristic distribution of emergence times. In this paper, we test our ability to recover various "true" emergence time distributions as a function of 1) stellar age uncertainty and 2) number of Earth analogs in the sample. The absolute uncertainties that we recover, for diverse underlying distributions, are mostly independent of the true underlying distribution parameters, and are more dependent on sample size than stellar age uncertainty. For a sample size of 30 Earth analogs, and an HWO architecture sensitive to ozone at 1% of the current atmospheric level on Earth, we find that no ozone detections across the entire sample would place a 10$\sigma$ limit on the mean time of ozone emergence, regardless of stellar age uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging discovery of a young giant planet orbiting on Solar System scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 135344 AB is a young visual binary system that is best known for the protoplanetary disk around the secondary star. The circumstellar environment of the A0-type primary star, on the other hand, is already depleted. HD 135344 A is therefore an ideal target for the exploration of recently formed giant planets because it is not obscured by dust. We searched for and characterized substellar companions to HD 135344 A down to separations of about 10 au. We observed HD 135344 A with VLT/SPHERE in the $H23$ and $K12$ bands and obtained $YJ$ and $YJH$ spectroscopy. In addition, we carried out VLTI/GRAVITY observations for the further astrometric and spectroscopic confirmation of a detected companion. We discovered a close-in young giant planet, HD 135344 Ab, with a mass of about 10 $M_\mathrm{J}$. The multi-epoch astrometry confirms the bound nature based on common parallax and common proper motion. This firmly rules out the scenario of a non-stationary background star. The semi-major axis of the planetary orbit is approximately 15-20 au, and the photometry is consistent with that of a mid L-type object. The inferred atmospheric and bulk parameters further confirm the young and planetary nature of the companion. HD 135344 Ab is one of the youngest directly imaged planets that has fully formed and orbits on Solar System scales. It is a valuable target for studying the early evolution and atmosphere of a giant planet that could have formed in the vicinity of the snowline.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the ZTF SLRN-2020 star-planet merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the optical and infrared transient ZTF SLRN-2020, previously associated with a star-planet merger. We consider the scenario in which orbital decay via tidal dissipation led to the merger, and find that tidal heating within the star was likely unobservable in the archival image of the system taken $12\mathrm{yr}$ before the merger. The observed dust formation months before the merger is consistent with a planet of mass $M_\mathrm{p} \gtrsim 5M_\mathrm{J}$ ejecting material as it skims the stellar surface. This interaction gradually intensifies, leading to significant mass ejection on a dynamical timescale ($ \approx $ hours) as the planet plunges into the stellar interior. Part of the recombination transient associated with this dynamical mass ejection might be inaccessible to the optical observations because its duration ($ \approx $ hours) is comparable to the cadence. Correspondingly, the observed duration of the transient $\approx100\mathrm{d}$ is inconsistent with a single episode of dynamical mass ejection. Instead, the transient could be powered by the recombination of $ \approx 3.4\times10^{-5}M_\odot $ of hydrogen in an outflow, or the contraction of an inflated envelope of mass $ \approx 10^{-6}M_\odot $ that formed during the merger. The observed ejecta mass $320\mathrm{d}$ after the peak of the optical transient is $ \approx 1.3\times10^{-4}M_\odot$, consistent with the idea that a fraction of the ejecta might be unobservable in the light curve. Energetically, this post-merger ejecta mass suggests a planet at least as massive as Jupiter. Our results suggest that ZTF SLRN-2020 was the result of a merger between a star close to the main sequence and a planet with mass at least several times that of Jupiter.</description>

      <title>Detecting Land with Reflected Light Spectroscopy to Rule Out Waterworld O$_2$ Biosignature False Positives</title>

Abstract: The search for life outside our solar system is at the forefront of modern astronomy, and telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) are being designed to identify biosignatures. Molecular oxygen, O$_2$, is considered a promising indication of life, yet substantial abiotic O$_2$ may accumulate from H$_2$O photolysis and hydrogen escape on a lifeless, fully (100%) ocean-covered terrestrial planet when surface O$_2$ sinks are suppressed. This so-called waterworld false positive scenario could be ruled out with land detection because exposed land precludes extremely deep oceans (~50 Earth oceans) given topographic limits set by the crushing strength of rocks. Land detection is possible because plausible geologic surfaces exhibit increasing reflectance with wavelength in the visible, whereas liquid water and ice/snow have flat or decreasing reflectance, respectively. Here, we present reflected light retrievals to demonstrate that HWO could detect land on an exo-Earth in the disk-averaged spectrum. Given a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 spectrum, Earth-like land fractions can be confidently detected with 0.3-1.1 $\mu$m spectral coverage (resolution R~140 in the visible, R~7 in the UV, with Earth-like atmosphere and clouds). We emphasize the need for UV spectroscopy down to at least 0.3 $\mu$m to break an O$_3$-land degeneracy. We find that the SNR and resolution requirements in the visible/UV imply that a larger aperture (~8 m) will be necessary to ensure the observing times required for land detection are feasible for most HWO terrestrial habitable zone targets. These results strongly inform the HWO minimum requirements to corroborate possible oxygen biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of CO in a warm bubble around accreting protoplanets and its observability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks are expected to contain a midplane-centered layer where gas-phase CO molecules freeze out and their overall abundance is low. The layer then manifests itself as a void in the channel maps of CO rotational emission lines. We explore whether the frozen-out layer can expose the circumplanetary environment of embedded accreting protoplanets to observations. To this end, we performed 3D radiative gas-dust hydrodynamic simulations with opacities determined by the redistribution of submicron- and millimeter-sized dust grains. A Jupiter-mass planet with an accretion luminosity of $\sim$$10^{-3}\,L_{\odot}$ was considered as the nominal case. The accretion heating sustains a warm bubble around the planet, which locally increases the abundance of gas-phase CO molecules. Radiative transfer predictions of the emergent sky images show that the bubble becomes a conspicuous CO emission source in channel maps. It appears as a low-intensity optically thick spot located in between the so-called dragonfly wings that trace the fore- and backside line-forming surfaces. The emission intensity of the bubble is nearly independent of the tracing isotopolog, suggesting a very rich observable chemistry, as long as its signal can be deblended from the extended disk emission. This can be achieved with isotopologs that are optically thin or weakly thermally stratified across the planet-induced gap, such as C$^{18}$O. For these, the bubble stands out as the brightest residual in synthetic ALMA observations after subtraction of axially averaged channel maps inferred from the disk kinematics, enabling new automatic detections of forming protoplanets. By contrast, the horseshoe flow steadily depletes large dust grains from the circumplanetary environment, which becomes unobservable in the submillimeter continuum, in accordance with the scarcity of ALMA detections.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>

Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <title>Brown dwarf number density in the JWST COSMOS-Web field</title>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 $M_J$), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 $\mu$m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities $12\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, $12\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, and $17\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Star formation and accretion rates within 500 pc as traced by Gaia DR3 XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]</description>
