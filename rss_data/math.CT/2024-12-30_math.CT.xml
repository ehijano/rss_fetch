      <title>Differentiable groupoid objects and their abstract Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infinitesimal counterpart of a Lie groupoid is its Lie algebroid. As a vector bundle, it is given by the source vertical tangent bundle restricted to the identity bisection. Its sections can be identified with the invariant vector fields on the groupoid, which are closed under the Lie bracket. We generalize this differentiation procedure to groupoid objects in any category with an abstract tangent structure in the sense of Rosick\'{y} and a scalar multiplication by a ring object that plays the role of the real numbers. We identify the categorical conditions that the groupoid object must satisfy to admit a natural notion of invariant vector fields. Then we show that invariant vector fields are closed under the Lie bracket defined by Rosick\'{y} and satisfy the Leibniz rule with respect to ring-valued morphisms on the base of the groupoid. The result is what we define axiomatically as an abstract Lie algebroid, by generalizing the underlying vector bundle to a module object in the slice category over its base. Examples include diffeomorphism groups, bisection groups of Lie groupoids, the diffeological symmetry groupoids of general relativity (Blohmann/Fernandes/Weinstein), symmetry groupoids in Lagrangian Field Theory, holonomy groupoids of singular foliations, elastic diffeological groupoids, and groupoid objects in differentiable stacks.</description>

      <title>On the architecture of the Symplectic $(A_\infty,2)$-Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note relates to the author's construction of the Symplectic $(A_\infty,2)$-Category, $\mathsf{Symp}$. Here we explain two ways of encoding the information in $\mathsf{Symp}$, one topological, one algebraic. The topological encoding is as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category, which we define here. The algebraic encoding is as a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category, which we extract from the topological encoding. In upcoming work, the author and Wehrheim plan to use the adiabatic Fredholm theory recently developed by Bottman-Wehrheim to construct $\mathsf{Symp}$ as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category.
  The definition of linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category that we give in this note is different than the one proposed by Bottman-Carmeli. The recursive structure of the 2-associahedra identifies faces with fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra, and these fiber products led Bottman-Carmeli to associate operations to singular chains on 2-associahedra. The innovation in our new definition of linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category is to extend the family of 2-associahedra to include all fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra. This allows us to associate operations to cellular chains, which in particular enables us to produce a definition that involves only one operation in each arity, governed by a collection of $(A_\infty,2)$-equations.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and set-generation of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible, is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that all torsion classes of abelian groups are generated by a set (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

      <title>Infinitary combinatorics in condensed math and strong homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in our understanding of higher derived limits carry multiple implications in the fields of condensed and pyknotic mathematics, as well as for the study of strong homology. These implications are thematically diverse, pertaining, for example, to the sheaf theory of extremally disconnected spaces, to Banach--Smith duality, to the productivity of compact projective condensed anima, and to the structure of the derived category of condensed abelian groups. Underlying each of these implications are the combinatorics of multidimensionally coherent families of functions of small infinite cardinal height, and it is for this reason that we convene accounts of them together herein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the category $\mathop{\mathrm{ref}}\Lambda$ of reflexive modules over a two-sided Noetherian ring $\Lambda$. We show that the category $\mathop{\mathrm{ref}}\Lambda$ is quasi-abelian if and only if $\Lambda$ satisfies certain Auslander-type condition on the minimal injective resolution of the ring itself. Furthermore, we establish a Morita theorem which characterizes the category of reflexive modules among quasi-abelian categories in terms of generator-cogenerators.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and engineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical system may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the dataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus my confined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically inter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries sampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even indistinguishable. So there is no unqiue source for the timeseries. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical framework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences. We introduce two categories of observed dynamical systems and timeseries-data. These are related to the well known category of dynamical systems via functors. This enables a functorial interpretation of the task of reconstruction as well.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a super version of the Littlewood--Richardson rule for super Schur functions over signed alphabets. We give in particular combinatorial interpretations of the super Littlewood--Richardson coefficients using the properties of super Young tableaux, which have found rich applications in representation theory, algebraic combinatorics, and mathematical physics.</description>
