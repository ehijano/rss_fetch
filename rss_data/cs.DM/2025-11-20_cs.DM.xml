      <title>String Graphs: Product Structure and Localised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate string graphs through the lens of graph product structure theory, which describes complicated graphs as subgraphs of strong products of simpler building blocks. A graph $G$ is called a string graph if its vertices can be represented by a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of continuous curves (called a string representation of $G$) in a surface so that two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if the corresponding curves in $\mathcal{C}$ cross. We prove that every string graph with bounded maximum degree in a fixed surface is isomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This extends recent product structure theorems for string graphs. Applications of this result are presented. This product structure theorem ceases to be true if the `bounded maximum degree' assumption is relaxed to `bounded degeneracy'. For string graphs in the plane, we give an alternative proof of this result. Specifically, we show that every string graph in the plane has a `localised' string representation where the number of crossing points on the curve representing a vertex $u$ is bounded by a function of the degree of $u$.
  Our proof of the product structure theorem also leads to a result about the treewidth of outerstring graphs, which qualitatively extends a result of Fox and Pach [Eur. J. Comb. 2012] about outerstring graphs with bounded maximum degree. We extend our result to outerstring graphs defined in arbitrary surfaces.</description>

      <title>On coarse tree decompositions and coarse balanced separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is a linear dependence between the treewidth of a graph and its balanced separator number: the smallest integer $k$ such that for every weighing of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most $k$. We investigate whether this connection can be lifted to the setting of coarse graph theory, where both the bags of the considered tree decompositions and the considered separators should be coverable by a bounded number of bounded-radius balls.
  As the first result, we prove that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits balanced separators coverable by $k$ balls of radius $r$, then $G$ also admits tree decompositions ${\cal T}_1$ and ${\cal T}_2$ such that:
  - in ${\cal T}_1$, every bag can be covered by $O(k\log n)$ balls of radius $r$; and
  - in ${\cal T}_2$, every bag can be covered by $O(k^2\log k)$ balls of radius $r(\log k+\log\log n+O(1))$.
  As the second result, we show that if we additionally assume that $G$ has doubling dimension at most $m$, then the functional equivalence between the existence of small balanced separators and of tree decompositions of small width can be fully lifted to the coarse setting. Precisely, we prove that for a positive integer $r$ and a graph $G$ of doubling dimension at most $m$, the following conditions are equivalent, with constants $k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4,\Delta_3,\Delta_4$ depending on each other and on $m$:
  - $G$ admits balanced separators consisting of $k_1$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree decomposition with bags coverable by $k_2$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree-partition of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_3$ with bags coverable by $k_3$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ is quasi-isometric to a graph of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_4$ and tree-partition width $\leq k_4$.</description>
