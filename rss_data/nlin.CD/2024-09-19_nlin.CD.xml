      <title>Tunneling Time for Walking Droplets on an Oscillating Liquid Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Couder and collaborators have initiated a series of studies on walking droplets. Experimentally, they found that at frequencies and amplitudes close to the onset of Faraday waves, droplets on the surface of silicone oil can survive and walk at a roughly constant speed due to resonance. Droplets excite local ripples from the Faraday instability when they bounce from the liquid surface. This tightly coupled particle-wave entity, although a complex yet entirely classical system, exhibits many phenomena that are strikingly similar to those of quantum systems, such as slit interference and diffraction, tunneling probability, and Anderson localization. In this Letter, we focus on the tunneling time of droplets. Specifically, we explore (1) how it changes with the width of an acrylic barrier, which gives rise to the potential barrier when the depth of the silicone oil is reduced to prevent the generation of ripples that can feed energy back to the droplet, and (2) the distribution of tunneling times at the same barrier width. Both results turn out to be similar to the numerical outcome of the Bohmian mechanics, which strengthens the analogy to a quantum system. Furthermore, we successfully derive analytic expressions for these properties by revising the multiple scattering theory and constructing a ``skipping stone" model. Provided that the resemblance in tunneling behavior of walking droplets to Bohmian particles is not coincidental, we discuss the lessons for the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics that so far fails to explain both characteristics adequately.</description>

      <title>A comparison between classical and Bohmian quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of chaos in a 2d system corresponding to a classical Hamiltonian system $V= \frac{1}{2}(\omega_x^2x^2+\omega_y^2y^2)+\epsilon xy^2$ consisting of two interacting harmonic oscillators and compare the classical and the Bohmian quantum trajectories for increasing values of $\epsilon$. In particular we present an initial quantum state composed of two coherent states in $x$ and $y$, which in the absence of interaction produces ordered trajectories (Lissajous figures) and an initial state which contains {both chaotic and ordered} trajectories for $\epsilon=0$. In both cases we find that, in general, Bohmian trajectories become chaotic in the long run, but chaos emerges at times which depend on the strength of the interaction between the oscillators.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and mixing quantum channels: From two-qubit to many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of classical ergodic theory has had a significant impact in the areas of mathematics, physics, and, in general, applied sciences. The quantum ergodic theory of Hamiltonian dynamics has its motivations to understand thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Quantum channel, a completely positive trace-preserving map, represents a most general representation of quantum dynamics and is an essential aspect of quantum information theory and quantum computation. In this work, we study the ergodic theory of quantum channels by characterizing different levels of ergodic hierarchy from integrable to mixing. The quantum channels on single systems are constructed from the unitary operators acting on bipartite states and tracing out the environment. The interaction strength of these unitary operators measured in terms of operator entanglement provides sufficient conditions for the channel to be mixing. By using block diagonal unitary operators, we construct a set of non-ergodic channels. By using canonical form of two-qubit unitary operator, we analytically construct the channels on single qubit ranging from integrable to mixing. Moreover, we also study interacting many-body quantum systems that include the famous Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that they display mixing within the framework of the quantum channel.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the pattern effect in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system through linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy surplus resulting from radiative forcing causes warming of the Earth system. This initial warming drives a myriad of changes including in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), leading to different radiative feedbacks. The relationship between the radiative feedbacks and the pattern of SST changes is referred to as the "pattern effect". The current approach to study the pattern effect relies on diagnosing the response of atmosphere-only models to perturbations in the SST boundary condition. Here, we argue that the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), together with coarse-graining procedures, is a computationally cheap and theoretically grounded alternative to model experiments. We introduce a protocol to study the pattern effect and present its application in a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. By focusing on the coupled dynamics, we unveil the role of the slow ocean component in setting the pattern effect. We present a new "sensitivity map", representing a first, qualitative prediction of the response of the average top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux to perturbations in the SST field. We find negative sensitivity throughout the tropics, in contrast to the current understanding of a positive-negative dipole of sensitivity in the tropical Pacific. Considering only the shortest time scales, the response is dominated by the fast atmospheric variability and we recover results in qualitative agreement with the literature. Therefore, the difference between our results and previous studies, largely comes from including the atmosphere-ocean coupling. The framework offers a conceptually novel perspective on the pattern effect: feedbacks in the coupled system are encoded in a temporally and spatially dependent response operator, rather than time-independent maps as for previous studies.</description>

      <title>Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>
