      <title>Recommendation Algorithms on Social Media: Unseen Drivers of Political Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media broadly refers to digital platforms and applications that simulate social interactions online. This study investigates the impact of social media platforms and their algorithms on political interest among users. As social media usage continues to rise, platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) play increasingly pivotal roles in shaping political discourse. By employing statistical analyses on data collected from over 3,300 participants, this research identifies significant differences in how various social media platforms influence political interest. Findings reveal that moderate Facebook users demonstrate decreased political engagement, whereas even minimal engagement with X significantly boosts political interest. The study further identifies demographic variations, noting that males, older individuals, Black or African American users, those with higher incomes show greater political interest. The demographic analysis highlights that Republicans are particularly active on social media - potentially influencing their social media engagement patterns. However, the study acknowledges a crucial limitation - the lack of direct data regarding the content users are exposed to which is shaping their social media experiences. Future research should explore these influences and consider additional popular platforms to enhance the understanding of social media's political impact. Addressing these gaps can provide deeper insights into digital political mobilization, aiding policymakers, educators, and platform designers in fostering healthier democratic engagement.</description>

      <title>Generating Large Semi-Synthetic Graphs of Any Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation. Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating robustness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Misinformation Detection Using Early Fusion of Linguistic, Visual, and Social Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection, primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR). The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.</description>

      <title>Source Detection in Hypergraph Epidemic Dynamics using a Higher-Order Dynamic Message Passing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Source detection is crucial for capturing the dynamics of real-world infectious diseases and informing effective containment strategies. Most existing approaches to source detection focus on conventional pairwise networks, whereas recent efforts on both mathematical modeling and analysis of contact data suggest that higher-order (e.g., group) interactions among individuals may both account for a large fraction of infection events and change our understanding of how epidemic spreading proceeds in empirical populations. In the present study, we propose a message-passing algorithm, called the HDMPN, for source detection for a stochastic susceptible-infectious dynamics on hypergraphs. By modulating the likelihood maximization method by the fraction of infectious neighbors, HDMPN aims to capture the influence of higher-order structures and do better than the conventional likelihood maximization. We numerically show that, in most cases, HDMPN outperforms benchmarks including the likelihood maximization method without modification.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Damage Severity: Estimating Earthquake Impacts Using Semantic Segmentation of Social Media Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Delving into LLM-assisted writing in biomedical publications through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in over 15 million biomedical abstracts from 2010--2024 indexed by PubMed, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

      <title>Reduced Efficiency in the Attentional Network During Distractor Suppression in Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia, making its early detection essential. This study investigates the neural mechanisms of distractor suppression in MCI patients using EEG and behavioral data during an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task. A cohort of 56 MCIs and 26 healthy controls (HCs) performed tasks with congruent and incongruent stimuli of varying saliency levels. During these tasks, EEG data were analyzed for alpha band coherence's functional connectivity, focusing on Global Efficiency (GE), while Reaction Time (RT) and Hit Rate (HR) were also collected.
  Our findings reveal significant interactions between congruency, saliency, and cognitive status on GE, RT, and HR. In HCs, congruent conditions resulted in higher GE (p = 0.0114, multivariate t-distribution correction, MVT), faster RTs (p &lt; 0.0001, MVT), and higher HRs (p &lt; 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions. HCs also showed increased GE in salient conditions for incongruent trials (p = 0.0406, MVT). MCIs exhibited benefits from congruent conditions with shorter RTs and higher HRs (both p &lt; 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions but showed reduced adaptability in GE, with no significant GE differences between conditions.
  These results highlight the potential of alpha band coherence and GE as early markers for cognitive impairment. By integrating GE, RT, and HR, this study provides insights into the interplay between neural efficiency, processing speed, and task accuracy. This approach offers valuable insights into cognitive load management and interference effects, indicating benefits for interventions aimed at improving attentional control and processing speed in MCIs.</description>
