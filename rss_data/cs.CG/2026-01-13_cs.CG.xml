      <title>Efficient Subdivision of B\'{e}zier Curves/Surfaces via Blossoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of B\'{e}zier curves/surfaces subdivision using blossoms. We propose closed-form formulae for blossoms evaluation, as needed for the calculation of control points. This approach leads to direct and efficient way to obtain subdivisions for B\'{e}zier curves and both tensor product and triangular B\'{e}zier surfaces. It simplifies considerably the computation of control points of subdivisions which is crucial in applications where curves/surfaces need to be refined or adapted dynamically. For instance, in CAD/CAM systems, architectural design, or animation, the ability to quickly and accurately determine new control points is essential for manipulation and rendering complex shapes. More efficient subdivision can facilitate complex operations like finding intersections between surfaces or smoothly blending multiple surfaces.</description>

      <title>Searching point patterns in point clouds describing local topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of comparing and aligning spatial point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ arising from structured geometric patterns. Each pattern is decomposed into arms along which we define a normalized finite-difference operator measuring local variations of the height component with respect to the planar geometry of the pattern. This quantity provides a parametrization-independent local descriptor that complements global similarity measures. In particular, it integrates naturally with Wasserstein-type distances for comparing point distributions and with Procrustes analysis for rigid alignment of geometric structures.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Drawing Venn Diagrams for Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VennFan, a method for generating $n$-set Venn diagrams based on the polar coordinate projection of trigonometric boundaries, resulting in Venn diagrams that resemble a set of fan blades. Unlike most classical constructions, our method emphasizes readability and customizability by using shaped sinusoids and amplitude scaling. We describe both sine- and cosine-based variants of VennFan and propose an automatic label placement heuristic tailored to these fan-like layouts. VennFan is available as a Python package (https://pypi.org/project/vennfan/).</description>

      <title>Minimum Star Partitions of Simple Polygons in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a polynomial-time algorithm for partitioning a simple polygon $P$ into a minimum number of star-shaped polygons. The question of whether such an algorithm exists has been open for more than four decades [Avis and Toussaint, Pattern Recognit., 1981] and it has been repeated frequently, for example in O'Rourke's famous book [Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms, 1987]. In addition to its strong theoretical motivation, the problem is also motivated by practical domains such as CNC pocket milling, motion planning, and shape parameterization.
  The only previously known algorithm for a non-trivial special case is for $P$ being both monotone and rectilinear [Liu and Ntafos, Algorithmica, 1991]. For general polygons, an algorithm was only known for the restricted version in which Steiner points are disallowed [Keil, SIAM J. Comput., 1985], meaning that each corner of a piece in the partition must also be a corner of $P$. Interestingly, the solution size for the restricted version may be linear for instances where the unrestricted solution has constant size. The covering variant in which the pieces are star-shaped but allowed to overlap--known as the Art Gallery Problem--was recently shown to be $\exists\mathbb R$-complete and is thus likely not in NP [Abrahamsen, Adamaszek and Miltzow, STOC 2018 &amp; J. ACM 2022]; this is in stark contrast to our result. Arguably the most related work to ours is the polynomial-time algorithm to partition a simple polygon into a minimum number of convex pieces by Chazelle and Dobkin [STOC, 1979 &amp; Comp. Geom., 1985].</description>

      <title>Morphing Graph Drawings in the Presence of Point Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crossing-free morph is a continuous deformation between two graph drawings that preserves straight-line pairwise noncrossing edges. Motivated by applications in 3D morphing problems, we initiate the study of morphing graph drawings in the plane in the presence of stationary point obstacles, which need to be avoided throughout the deformation.
  As our main result, we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether such an obstacle-avoiding 2D morph between two given drawings of the same graph exists. In fact, this statement remains true even in the severely restricted special case where only three vertices have to change positions. This is in sharp contrast to the classical case without obstacles, where there is an efficiently verifiable (necessary and sufficient) criterion for the existence of a morph.
  Further, we provide several combinatorial results related to conditions under which the existence of a morph between two drawings of a graph can or cannot be prevented by the placement of a given number of point obstacles.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for Spaces of Curvature Bounded Above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact subsets $X\subset\R^N$ that have the Alexandrov curvature bounded above ($\leq$ $\kappa$) in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact for subspaces of curvature bounded above. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions as an alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes homotopy-type reconstruction guarantees for spaces with vanishing reach and $\mu$--reach, a regime not covered by existing sampling conditions.</description>
