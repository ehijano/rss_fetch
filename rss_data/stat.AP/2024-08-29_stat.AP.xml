      <title>Bayesian inference for the Markov-modulated Poisson process with an outcome process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical research, understanding changes in outcome measurements is crucial for inferring shifts in a patient's underlying health condition. While data from clinical and administrative systems hold promise for advancing this understanding, traditional methods for modelling disease progression struggle with analyzing a large volume of longitudinal data collected irregularly and do not account for the phenomenon where the poorer an individual's health, the more frequently they interact with the healthcare system. In addition, data from the claim and health care system provide no information for terminating events, such as death. To address these challenges, we start from the continuous-time hidden Markov model to understand disease progression by modelling the observed data as an outcome whose distribution depends on the state of a latent Markov chain representing the underlying health state. However, we also allow the underlying health state to influence the timings of the observations via a point process. Furthermore, we create an addition "death" state and model the unobserved terminating event, a transition to this state, via an additional Poisson process whose rate depends on the latent state of the Markov chain. This extension allows us to model disease severity and death not only based on the types of care received but also on the temporal and frequency aspects of different observed events. We present an exact Gibbs sampler procedure that alternates sampling the complete path of the hidden chain (the latent health state throughout the observation window) conditional on the complete paths. When the unobserved, terminating event occurs early in the observation window, there are no more observed events, and naive use of a model with only "live" health states would lead to biases in parameter estimates; our inclusion of a "death" state mitigates against this.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Modelling of Cancer Mortality Trends in Colombia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare semiparametric and parametric model adjustments for cancer mortality in breast and cervical cancer and prostate and lung cancer in men, according to age and period of death. Semiparametric models were adjusted for the number of deaths from the two localizations of greatest mortality by sex: breast and cervix in women; prostate and lungs in men. Adjustments in different semiparametric models were compared; which included making adjustments with different distributions and variable combinations in the parametric and non-parametric part, for localization as well as for scale. Finally, the semiparametric model with best adjustment was selected and compared to traditional model; that is, to the generalized lineal model with Poisson response and logarithmic link. Best results for the four kinds of cancer were obtained for the selected semiparametric model by comparing it to the traditional Poisson model based upon AIC, envelope correlation between estimated logarithm rate and real rate logarithm. In general, we observe that in estimation, rate increases with age; however, with respect to period, breast cancer and stomach cancer in men show a tendency to rise over time; on the other hand, for cervical cancer, it remains virtually constant, but for lung cancer in men, as of 2007, it tends to decrease.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-subject Test Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group.
  We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \( t \) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject.</description>

      <title>Investigating Complex HPV Dynamics Using Emulation and History Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of transmission and progression of human papillomavirus (HPV) is crucial for understanding the incidence of cervical cancers, and has been identified as a priority worldwide. The complexity of the disease necessitates a detailed model of HPV transmission and its progression to cancer; to infer properties of the above we require a careful process that can match to imperfect or incomplete observational data. In this paper, we describe the HPVsim simulator to satisfy the former requirement; to satisfy the latter we couple this stochastic simulator to a process of emulation and history matching using the R package hmer. With these tools, we are able to obtain a comprehensive collection of parameter combinations that could give rise to observed cancer data, and explore the implications of the variability of these parameter sets as it relates to future health interventions.</description>

      <title>Connecting Mass-action Models and Network Models for Infectious Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infectious disease modeling is used to forecast epidemics and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Although the core assumption of mass-action models of homogeneously mixed population is often implausible, they are nevertheless routinely used in studying epidemics and provide useful insights. Network models can account for the heterogeneous mixing of populations, which is especially important for studying sexually transmitted diseases. Despite the abundance of research on mass-action and network models, the relationship between them is not well understood. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap by first identifying a spreading rule that results in an exact match between disease spreading on a fully connected network and the classic mass-action models. We then propose a method for mapping epidemic spread on arbitrary networks to a form similar to that of mass-action models. We also provide a theoretical justification for the procedure. Finally, we show the advantages of the proposed methods using synthetic data that is based on an empirical network. These findings help us understand when mass-action models and network models are expected to provide similar results and identify reasons when they do not.</description>

      <title>Implementing MCMC: Multivariate estimation with confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the key challenge of estimating the asymptotic covariance associated with the Markov chain central limit theorem, which is essential for visualizing and terminating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We focus on summarizing batching, spectral, and initial sequence covariance estimation techniques. We emphasize practical recommendations for modern MCMC simulations, where positive correlation is common and leads to negatively biased covariance estimates. Our discussion is centered on computationally efficient methods that remain viable even when the number of iterations is large, offering insights into improving the reliability and accuracy of MCMC output in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cellwise robust and sparse principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first proposal of a sparse and cellwise robust PCA method is presented. Robustness to single outlying cells in the data matrix is achieved by substituting the squared loss function for the approximation error by a robust version. The integration of a sparsity-inducing $L_1$ or elastic net penalty offers additional modeling flexibility. For the resulting challenging optimization problem, an algorithm based on Riemannian stochastic gradient descent is developed, with the advantage of being scalable to high-dimensional data, both in terms of many variables as well as observations. The resulting method is called SCRAMBLE (Sparse Cellwise Robust Algorithm for Manifold-based Learning and Estimation). Simulations reveal the superiority of this approach in comparison to established methods, both in the casewise and cellwise robustness paradigms. Two applications from the field of tribology underline the advantages of a cellwise robust and sparse PCA method.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Adjusted Simultaneous Testing for Ultra High-dimensional Grouped Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epigenetics plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying molecular processes of several types of cancer as well as the determination of innovative therapeutic tools. To investigate the complex interplay between genetics and environment, we develop a novel procedure to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) among cases and controls. Statistically, this translates to an ultra high-dimensional testing problem with sparse signals and an inherent grouping structure. When the total number of variables being tested is massive and typically exhibits some degree of dependence, existing group-wise multiple comparisons adjustment methods lead to inflated false discoveries. We propose a class of Correlation-Adjusted Simultaneous Testing (CAST) procedures incorporating the general dependence among probes within and between genes to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Simulations demonstrate that CASTs have superior empirical power while maintaining the FDR compared to the benchmark group-wise. Moreover, while the benchmark fails to control FDR for small-sized grouped correlated data, CAST exhibits robustness in controlling FDR across varying group sizes. In bladder cancer data, the proposed CAST method confirms some existing differentially methylated probes implicated with the disease (Langevin, et. al., 2014). However, CAST was able to detect novel DMPs that the previous study (Langevin, et. al., 2014) failed to identify. The CAST method can accurately identify significant potential biomarkers and facilitates informed decision-making aligned with precision medicine in the context of complex data analysis.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes latent class approach for EHR-based phenotyping with large real-world data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the performance and characteristics of currently available VB and MCMC software to explore the practicability of available approaches and provide guidance for clinical practitioners. Two case studies are used to fully explore the methods covering a variety of real-world data. First, we use the publicly available Pima Indian diabetes data to comprehensively compare VB implementations of logistic regression. Second, a large real-world data set, Optum(TM) EHR with approximately one million diabetes patients extended the analysis to large, highly unbalanced data containing discrete and continuous variables. A Bayesian patient phenotyping composite model incorporating latent class analysis (LCA) and regression was implemented with the second case study. We find that several data characteristics common in clinical data, such as sparsity, significantly affect the posterior accuracy of automatic VB methods compared with conditionally conjugate mean-field methods. We find that for both models, automatic VB approaches require more effort and technical knowledge to set up for accurate posterior estimation and are very sensitive to stopping time compared with closed-form VB methods. Our results indicate that the patient phenotyping composite Bayes model is more easily usable for real-world studies if Monte Carlo is replaced with VB. It can potentially become a uniquely useful tool for decision support, especially for rare diseases where gold-standard biomarker data is sparse but prior knowledge can be used to assist model diagnosis and may suggest when biomarker tests are warranted.</description>

Abstract: A new unsupervised predictive maintenance analysis method based on the renormalization group approach used to discover critical behavior in complex systems has been proposed. The algorithm analyzes univariate time series and detects critical points based on a newly proposed theorem that identifies critical points using a Log Periodic Power Law function fits. Application of a new algorithm for predictive maintenance analysis of industrial data collected from reciprocating compressor systems is presented. Based on the knowledge of the dynamics of the analyzed compressor system, the proposed algorithm predicts valve and piston rod seal failures well in advance.</description>

Abstract: In this report we generalize the game of Book or Band described in Levin (2024) to an arbitrary playing deck with $m$ ranks and $s$ cards in each rank, for a total of $t=ms$ cards. Two events (a band or a bump) are defined in terms of given non-negative integers $0\le l\le u \le s$, not necessarily with $l+u=s$. We derive expressions for the joint stopping time distribution and outcome band or bump in terms of rectangular event probabilities for central multiple hyper-geometric random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make use of Kronecker structure for scaling Gaussian Process models to large-scale, heterogeneous, clinical data sets. Repeated measures, commonly performed in clinical research, facilitate computational acceleration for nonlinear Bayesian nonparametric models and enable exact sampling for non-conjugate inference, when combinations of continuous and discrete endpoints are observed. Model inference is performed in Stan, and comparisons are made with brms on simulated data and two real clinical data sets, following a radiological image quality theme. Scalable Gaussian Process models compare favourably with parametric models on real data sets with 17,460 observations. Different GP model specifications are explored, with components analogous to random effects, and their theoretical properties are described.</description>
