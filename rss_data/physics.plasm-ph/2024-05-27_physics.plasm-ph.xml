      <title>Investigating Turbulence Effects on Magnetic Reconnection Rates Through High-Resolution Three-Dimensional Resistive Magnetohydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of turbulence on magnetic reconnection through high-resolution 3D MHD simulations, covering Lundquist numbers from $S=10^3$ to $10^6$. Our simulations introduce small-scale perturbations injected into the system until $t=0.1\, t_A$. Even after the initial perturbation ceases, turbulence grows and persists, leading to sustained high reconnection rates of $V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.03-0.08$, which surpass those generated solely by resistive tearing modes (plasmoids) observed in 2D and 3D PIC/MHD simulations by factors of 5 to 6. Our findings reveal that the achieved reconnection rates align with observations in solar phenomena and those reported in 3D MHD global simulations of accretion flows and relativistic jets. Notably, our simulations exhibit a steady-state reconnection rate coinciding with the full development of turbulence, showcasing the robustness and persistence of the reconnection in a turbulent environment. We establish the independence of the reconnection rate from the Lundquist number, consistent with the theory of turbulent reconnection proposed by Lazarian and Vishniac. Our results demonstrate a mild dependence of $V_\text{rec}$ on the plasma-$\beta$ parameter, the ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressure, illustrating a decrease from $0.036$ to $0.028$ as $\beta$ increases from $2$ to $64$ for simulations with $S=10^5$. Finally, we explore the influence of the magnetic Prandtl number ($\text{Pr}_m=\nu/\eta$) on the reconnection rate and find this influence to be negligible during the turbulent regime across the range tested, from $\text{Pr}_m=1$ to $60$. These findings carry significant implications for research into reconnection and particle acceleration within realistic magnetized space and astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>The effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use particle-in-cell, fully electromagnetic, plasma kinetic simulation to study the effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (ESKHI). The results are applicable to collisionless plasmas when e.g. solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres or magnetic field is generated in AGN jets. We find that as in the case of magnetohydrodynamic KHI, in the kinetic regime, presence of external magnetic field reduces growth rate of the instability. In MHD case there is known threshold magnetic field for KHI stabilization, while in for ESKHI this is to be analytically determined. Without a kinetic analytical expression, we use several numerical simulation runs to establish an empirical dependence of ESKHI growth rate, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}$, on the strength of applied external magnetic field. We find the best fit is hyperbolic, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}=\Gamma_0\omega_{\rm pe}/(A+B\bar B_0)$, where $\Gamma_0$ is the ESKHI growth rate without external magnetic field and $\bar B_0=B_0/B_{\rm MHD}$ is the ratio of external and two-fluid MHD stability threshold magnetic field, derived here. An analytical theory to back up this growth rate dependence on external magnetic field is needed. The results suggest that in astrophysical settings where strong magnetic field pre-exists, the generation of an additional magnetic field by the ESKHI is suppressed, which implies that the Nature provides a "safety valve" -- natural protection not to "over-generate" magnetic field by ESKHI mechanism. Remarkably, we find that our two-fluid MHD threshold magnetic field is the same (up to a factor $\sqrt{\gamma_0}$) as the DC saturation magnetic field, previously predicted by fully kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and ion heating in 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov (fully kinetic ions and fluid electrons) simulations of sub-ion-scale plasma turbulence with quasi-isotropic, compressible injection close to the ion scales to investigate electron-only reconnection and its effect on ion heating. Retaining electron inertia in the generalized Ohm s law provides the mechanism for collisionless magnetic reconnection. Spectral analysis reveals a shift from kinetic Alfv\'{e}n waves (KAW) to inertial kinetic Alfv\'{e}n (IKAW) and inertial whistler waves (IWW) near electron scales. To distinguish the roles of the inertial scale and the gyroradius (d_{\rm{i}} and \rho_{\rm{i}}), three values of ion beta (\beta_{\rm{i}} = 0.25, 1, 4) are studied. Ion-electron decoupling increases with \beta_{\rm{i}}, as ions become less mobile when the injection scale is closer to \rho_{\rm{i}} than to d_{\rm{i}}, highlighting the role of \rho_{\rm{i}} in achieving an electron magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) regime at sub-ion scales. The EMHD regime promotes electron-only reconnection in turbulence with small-scale injection at \beta_{\rm{i}} \gtrsim 1. Despite this EMHD-favoured dynamics, we still observe significant ion heating also at large \beta_{\rm{i}}, namely Q_{\rm{i}}/\epsilon \approx 69, 91, and 96 at \beta_{\rm{i}} = 0.25, 1, and 4, respectively. Moreover, while ion heating is significantly anisotropic at \beta_{\rm{i}} \leq 1 (namely, T_{\rm i,\perp} &gt; T_{\rm i,\parallel}), it becomes only marginally anisotropic at \beta_{\rm{i}} &gt; 1 (i.e., T_{\rm i,\perp} \gtrsim T_{\rm i,\parallel}). Our results highlight that ion turbulent heating in collisionless plasmas is sensitive to the separation between injection scales \lambda_{\text{inj}} and the ion gyroradius \rho_{\rm{i}}, as well as to \beta_{\rm{i}} and finite-k_{\parallel} effects, requiring an extended investigation of these parameters for accurate modelling.</description>

      <title>A numerical integration scheme for vectorised phase-space of one-dimensional collision-free, electrostatic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic analyses of many-particle soft matter often employ many simulation studies of various physical phenomena which supplement the experimental limitations or compliment the theoretical findings of the study. Such simulations are generally conducted by the numerical integration techniques of the governing equations. In the typical case of collisionless electrostatic systems such as electrostatic plasmas, the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equation system governs the dynamical evolution of the particle phase-space. The one-dimensional position-velocity (1D-1V) particle phase-space, on the other hand, is known to exhibit direct analogy with ordinary two-dimensional fluids, wherein the Vlasov equation resembles the fluid continuity equation of an in-compressible fluid. On the basis of this fluid-analogy, we present, in this work, a new numerical integration scheme which treats the 1D-1V phase-space as a two-dimensional fluid vector space. We then perform and present analyses of numerical accuracy of this scheme and compare its speed and accuracy with the well-known finite splitting scheme, which is a standardised technique for the numerical Vlasov-Poisson integration. Finally, we show some simulation results of the 1D collisionless electrostatic plasma which highlight the higher speed and accuracy of the new scheme. This work presents a fast and sufficiently accurate numerical integration technique of the VP system which can be directly employed in various simulation studies of many particle systems, including plasmas.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification by relativistic shocks in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in relativistic shocks propagating in inhomogeneous media are investigated by three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations and test-particle simulations. The MHD simulations show that the interaction between the relativistic shock and dense clumps amplifies the downstream magnetic field to the value expected from observations of the gamma-ray burst. The test-particle simulations in the electromagnetic field given by the MHD simulation show that particles are accelerated by the downstream turbulence and the relativistic shock. We provide the injection energy to the shock acceleration in this system. If the amplitude of upstream density fluctuations is sufficiently large, low-energy particles are initially accelerated to the injection energy by the downstream turbulence and then rapidly accelerated to higher energies by the relativistic shock. Therefore, the density fluctuation significantly affects particle acceleration in the relativistic shock.</description>

      <title>3-Minute Oscillations in the Upper Corona: Evidence from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) from around the Alfv\'en surface have shown that the trace magnetic power spectrum density (PSD) is often characterized by a shallow-inertial double power law, where in the low frequency energy injection range, the power spectrum is shallow (flatter than $1/f$), and in the inertial range the spectrum is steep, with a scaling index of [1.5, 1.67]. Consequently, close to the sun, the majority of the fluctuation energy concentrates in a small frequency range around the low frequency power spectral break. In this work, we conduct a systematic survey of PSP observations for the first 17 encounters to statistically study the energy behaviors of the magnetic fluctuations. Our results show that the center frequency of fluctuation energy systematically drifts to around 3-minute for the most pristine solar wind (smallest solar wind advection time). Moreover, the center frequency rapidly drifts to lower frequency as solar wind advection time increases, as expected for active turbulence. The concentration of fluctuation energy around 3-minutes suggests that Alfv\'enic fluctuations in solar wind might mostly be coming from resonant p-mode oscillations in the photosphere, though other potential sources are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-particle resonance, a ubiquitous process in the plasma universe, occurs when resonant particles observe a constant wave phase to enable sustained energy transfer. Here, we present spacecraft observations of simultaneous Landau and anomalous resonances between oblique whistler waves and the same group of protons, which are evidenced, respectively, by phase-space rings in parallel-velocity spectra and phase-bunched distributions in gyro-phase spectra. Our results indicate the coupling between Landau and anomalous resonances via the overlapping of the resonance islands.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>

      <title>Broadening of the Divertor Heat Flux Profile in High Confinement Tokamak Fusion Plasmas with Edge Pedestals Limited by Turbulence in DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-machine empirical scaling predicts an extremely narrow heat exhaust layer in future high magnetic field tokamaks, producing high power densities that require mitigation. In the experiments presented, the width of this exhaust layer is nearly doubled using actuators to increase turbulent transport in the plasma edge. This is achieved in low collisionality, high confinement edge pedestals with their gradients limited by turbulent transport instead of large-scale, coherent instabilities. The exhaust heat flux profile width and divertor leg diffusive spreading both double as a high frequency band of turbulent fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction doubles in amplitude. The results are quantitatively reproduced in electromagnetic XGC particle-in-cell simulations which show the heat flux carried by electrons emerges to broaden the heat flux profile, directly supported by Langmuir probe measurements.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under X-ray free electron laser illumination conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging technique of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) can be used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules to high spatial and temporal resolutions. An ongoing challenge for SFX is the damage caused by the ultrabright X-ray free electron laser pulse. Though it is often assumed that sufficiently femtosecond pulses `outrun' radiation damage, in reality electronic damage processes commence during exposure. We model the electronic damage to protein nanocrystals using a plasma model that tracks the continuous changes to the energy distribution of the unbound electrons. Tracking the continuous energy distribution is of particular importance for distinguishing the influence of differing elements on secondary damage processes. Heavy atoms have a ubiquitous but small presence in protein targets - typically as integral components of the macromolecule and as salts in the solvent. We find that these atoms considerably influence the simulated ionization and scattering behavior of realistic targets due to their rapid seeding of secondary ionization processes. In lysozyme, even the presence of native sulfur atoms significantly contributes to theoretical measures of damage-induced noise for &gt;= 6 keV, 15 fs pulses. Contributing to the effect is that heavy atoms seed `intermediate' energy electron cascades that are particularly effective at ionizing the target on the femtosecond timescale. In addition, the disproportionate effect of heavy atoms means the damage to a protein crystal can be sensitive to their presence in the solvent. Outside of reducing the concentration of heavy atoms in the target, these results suggest the dose limits of SFX targets will be higher where the ionization of deep &gt;~ 6 keV absorption edges is minimized, or, to a lesser extent, when such edges are only ionized with X-rays &gt;&gt; 2 keV above their binding energy.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field using the spinor quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the adiabatic basis, the one-particle distribution function in momentum space is determined by utilizing the exact analytical solution of the Dirac equation. By examining the temporal behavior of the one-particle distribution function and the momentum spectrum of created pairs in the sub-critical field limit $(E_0 = 0.2E_c)$, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum(LMS) of particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the dynamical tunneling. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, which allows us to explain the origin and behavior of these oscillations. Additionally, we discuss the role of the vacuum polarization function and its counter term to the oscillations in LMS vacuum excitation. We also analyse the transverse momentum spectrum (TMS).</description>
