      <title>A SageMath Package for Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables: Beyond the Smooth Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) develops techniques to compute the asymptotic behaviour of multivariate sequences from analytic properties of their generating functions. When the generating function under consideration is rational, its set of singularities forms an algebraic variety -- called the singular variety -- and asymptotic behaviour depends heavily on the geometry of the singular variety. By combining a recent algorithm for the Whitney stratification of algebraic varieties with methods from ACSV, we present the first software that rigorously computes asymptotics of sequences whose generating functions have non-smooth singular varieties (under other assumptions on local geometry). Our work is built on the existing sage_acsv package for the SageMath computer algebra system, which previously gave asymptotics under a smoothness assumption. We also report on other improvements to the package, such as an efficient technique for determining higher order asymptotic expansions using Newton iteration, the ability to use more efficient backends for algebraic computations, and a method to compute so-called critical points for any multivariate rational function through Whitney stratification.</description>

      <title>TinyverseGP: Towards a Modular Cross-domain Benchmarking Framework for Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the years, genetic programming (GP) has evolved, with many proposed variations, especially in how they represent a solution. Being essentially a program synthesis algorithm, it is capable of tackling multiple problem domains. Current benchmarking initiatives are fragmented, as the different representations are not compared with each other and their performance is not measured across the different domains. In this work, we propose a unified framework, dubbed TinyverseGP (inspired by tinyGP), which provides support to multiple representations and problem domains, including symbolic regression, logic synthesis and policy search.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Invertible Matrix Theorem with Linear Relations using Graphical Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear algebra's main concerns are sets of vectors, linear functions, subspaces, linear systems, matrices and concepts about those, such as whether the solution of linear system exists or is unique; a set of vectors is linearly independent or spans the whole space; a linear function has a right or a left inverse; a linear function is surjective or injective; and the kernel of a matrix is trivial or the its image is full.
  The Invertible Matrix Theorem ties all these ideas and many others together. Many modern linear algebra books use this theorem as a guiding principle to explain many connections in linear algebra. The main idea is to separately characterize whether the linear function is surjective or injective. The proof usually uses a matrix decomposition as the key step. However, the invertible matrix theorem deals with a single linear function, a single set of vectors, a single subspace, and a single matrix.
  In this work, we generalize part of the invertible matrix theorem to results about a pair of linear functions, a pair of sets of vectors, a pair of subspaces, and a single linear relation. The main idea is to separately characterize the linear relation's fundamental properties -- whether it is surjective, injective, deterministic and total. Our proof uses a decomposition of a linear relation as the key step.
  Unfortunately, reasoning with linear relations in classical notation requires applying many rules besides shuffling quantifiers and variables around, which can obscure the symmetries in the results. Therefore, this work employs graphical linear algebra, a two-dimensional diagrammatic syntax with the fundamental rules of linear relations built-in.</description>

      <title>Moment-based Density Elicitation with Applications in Probabilistic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the K-series estimation approach for the recovery of unknown univariate and multivariate distributions given knowledge of a finite number of their moments. Our method is directly applicable to the probabilistic analysis of systems that can be represented as probabilistic loops; i.e., algorithms that express and implement non-deterministic processes ranging from robotics to macroeconomics and biology to software and cyber-physical systems. K-series statically approximates the joint and marginal distributions of a vector of continuous random variables updated in a probabilistic non-nested loop with nonlinear assignments given a finite number of moments of the unknown density. Moreover, K-series automatically derives the distribution of the systems' random variables symbolically as a function of the loop iteration. K-series density estimates are accurate, easy and fast to compute. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach on multiple benchmark examples from the literature.</description>
