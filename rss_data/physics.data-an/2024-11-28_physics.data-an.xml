      <title>In-situ observations of resident space objects with the CHEOPS space telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is a partnership between the European Space Agency and Switzerland with important contributions by 10 additional ESA member States. It is the first S-class mission in the ESA Science Programme. CHEOPS has been flying on a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit since December 2019, collecting millions of short-exposure images in the visible domain to study exoplanet properties. A small yet increasing fraction of CHEOPS images show linear trails caused by resident space objects crossing the instrument field of view. To characterize the population of satellites and orbital debris observed by CHEOPS, all and every science images acquired over the past 3 years have been scanned with a Hough transform algorithm to identify the characteristic linear features that these objects cause on the images. Thousands of trails have been detected. This statistically significant sample shows interesting trends and features such as an increased occurrence rate over the past years as well as the fingerprint of the Starlink constellation. The cross-matching of individual trails with catalogued objects is underway as we aim to measure their distance at the time of observation and deduce the apparent magnitude of the detected objects. As space agencies and private companies are developing new space-based surveillance and tracking activities to catalogue and characterize the distribution of small debris, the CHEOPS experience is timely and relevant. With the first CHEOPS mission extension currently running until the end of 2026, and a possible second extension until the end of 2029, the longer time coverage will make our dataset even more valuable to the community, especially for characterizing objects with recurrent crossings.</description>

      <title>A one-stop strategy to search for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind continuous gravitational-wave (CWs) searches are a significant computational challenge due to their long duration and weak amplitude of the involved signals. To cope with such problem, the community has developed a variety of data-analysis strategies which are usually tailored to specific CW searches; this prevents their applicability across the nowadays broad landscape of potential CW source. Also, their sensitivity is typically hard to model, and thus usually requires a significant computing investment. We present fasttracks, a massively-parallel engine to evaluate detection statistics for generic CW signals using GPU computing. We demonstrate a significant increase in computational efficiency by parallelizing the brute-force evaluation of detection statistics without using any computational approximations. Also, we introduce a simple and scalable post processing which allows us to formulate a generic semi-analytic sensitivity estimate algorithm. These proposals are tested in a minimal all-sky search in data from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The strategies here discussed will become increasingly relevant in the coming years as long-duration signals become a standard observation of future ground-based and space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Surveying the space of descriptions of a composite system with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate information theory provides a general and principled framework for understanding how the components of a complex system are connected. Existing analyses are coarse in nature -- built up from characterizations of discrete subsystems -- and can be computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose to study the continuous space of possible descriptions of a composite system as a window into its organizational structure. A description consists of specific information conveyed about each of the components, and the space of possible descriptions is equivalent to the space of lossy compression schemes of the components. We introduce a machine learning framework to optimize descriptions that extremize key information theoretic quantities used to characterize organization, such as total correlation and O-information. Through case studies on spin systems, Sudoku boards, and letter sequences from natural language, we identify extremal descriptions that reveal how system-wide variation emerges from individual components. By integrating machine learning into a fine-grained information theoretic analysis of composite random variables, our framework opens a new avenues for probing the structure of real-world complex systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correcting for detector effects in experimental data, particularly through unfolding, is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel approach to multidimensional object-wise unfolding using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, incorporating distribution moments as conditioning information, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions, while enabling the unfolding of a wide range of measured distributions with improved adaptability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.</description>
