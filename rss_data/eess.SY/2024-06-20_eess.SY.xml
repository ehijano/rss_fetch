      <title>Constructing and Evaluating Digital Twins: An Intelligent Framework for DT Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Digital Twins (DTs) represents a transformative advance for simulating and optimizing complex systems in a controlled digital space. Despite their potential, the challenge of constructing DTs that accurately replicate and predict the dynamics of real-world systems remains substantial. This paper introduces an intelligent framework for the construction and evaluation of DTs, specifically designed to enhance the accuracy and utility of DTs in testing algorithmic performance. We propose a novel construction methodology that integrates deep learning-based policy gradient techniques to dynamically tune the DT parameters, ensuring high fidelity in the digital replication of physical systems. Moreover, the Mean STate Error (MSTE) is proposed as a robust metric for evaluating the performance of algorithms within these digital space. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations that show our DT not only accurately mirrors the physical reality but also provides a reliable platform for algorithm evaluation. This work lays a foundation for future research into DT technologies, highlighting pathways for both theoretical enhancements and practical implementations in various industries.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated DCOPF using Gradient-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is a key operational tool for power system operators, and it is embedded as a subproblem in many challenging optimization problems (e.g., line switching). However, traditional CPU-based solve routines (e.g., simplex) have saturated in speed and are hard to parallelize. This paper focuses on solving DCOPF problems using gradient-based routines on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which have massive parallelization capability. To formulate these problems, we pose a Lagrange dual associated with DCOPF (linear and quadratic cost curves), and then we explicitly solve the inner (primal) minimization problem with a dual norm. The resulting dual problem can be efficiently iterated using projected gradient ascent. After solving the dual problem on both CPUs and GPUs to find tight lower bounds, we benchmark against Gurobi and MOSEK, comparing convergence speed and tightness on the IEEE 2000 and 10000 bus systems. We provide reliable and tight lower bounds for these problems with, at best, 5.4x speedup over a conventional solver.</description>

      <title>State Anti-windup: A New Methodology for Tackling State Constraints at Both Synthesis and Implementation Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anti-windup compensation typically addresses strict control limitations in control systems. However, there is a clear need for an equivalent solution for the states/outputs of the system. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the state anti-windup compensator. Unlike state-constrained control methods, which often focus on incorporating soft constraints into the design or fail to react adequately to constraint violations in practical settings, the proposed methodology treats state constraints as implement-oriented soft-hard constraints. This is achieved by integrating a saturation block within the structure of the safety compensator, referred to as the state anti-windup (SANTW) compensator. Similar to input anti-windup schemes, the SANTW design is separated from the nominal controller design. The problem is formulated as a disturbance rejection one to directly minimize the saturation. The paper develops two Hinf optimization frameworks using frequency-domain solutions and linear matrix inequalities. It then addresses constraints on both inputs and states, resulting in a unified Input-State Anti-windup (IS-ANTW) compensator synthesized using non-smooth Hinf optimization. This method also offers the flexibility of having a fixed-order compensator, crucial in many practical applications. Additionally, the study evaluates the proposed compensator's performance in managing current fluctuations from renewable energy sources during grid faults, demonstrating its effectiveness through detailed Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations of grid-connected DC-AC converters.</description>

      <title>Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</description>

      <title>The effect of control barrier functions on energy transfers in controlled physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a port-Hamiltonian formalism, we show the qualitative and quantitative effect of safety-critical control implemented with control barrier functions (CBFs) on the power balance of controlled physical systems. The presented results will provide novel tools to design CBFs inducing desired energetic behaviors of the closed-loop system, including nontrivial damping injection effects and non-passive control actions, effectively injecting energy in the system in a controlled manner. Simulations validate the stated results.</description>

      <title>Design of Phase Locked Loop in 180 nm Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented paper introduces a design for a phase-locked loop (PLL) that is utilized in frequency synthesis and modulation-demodulation within communication systems and in VLSI applications. The CMOS PLL is designed using 180 nm Fabrication Technology on Cadence Virtuoso Tool with a supply voltage of 1.8 V. The performance is evaluated through simulations and measurements, which demonstrate its ability to track and lock onto the input frequency. The PLL is a frequency synthesizer implemented to generate 2.4 GHz frequency. The input reference clock from a crystal oscillator is 150 MHz square wave. Negative feedback is given by divide-by-16 frequency divider, ensuring the phase and frequency synchronization between the divided signal and the reference signal. The design has essential components such as a phase frequency detector, charge pump, loop filter, current-starved voltage-controlled oscillator (CSVCO), and frequency divider. Through their collaborative operation, the system generates an output frequency that is 16 times the input frequency. The centre frequency of the 3-stage CSVCO is 3.208 GHz at 900 mV input voltage. With an input voltage ranging from 0.4 V to 1.8 V, the VCO offers a tuning range that spans from 1.066 GHz to 3.731 GHz.PLL demonstrates a lock-in range spanning from 70.4 MHz to 173 MHz, with an output frequency range of 1.12 GHz to 2.78 GHz. It achieves a lock time of 260.03 ns and consumes a maximum power of 5.15 mW at 2.4 GHz.</description>

      <title>Measured-state conditioned recursive feasibility for stochastic model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of designing stochastic model predictive control (MPC) schemes for linear systems affected by unbounded disturbances. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, motivated by the difficulty of guaranteeing recursive feasibility in this framework, due to the nonzero probability of violating chance-constraints in the case of unbounded noise, we introduce the novel definition of measured-state conditioned recursive feasibility in expectation. Second, we construct a stochastic MPC scheme, based on the introduction of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets, which implements a closed-loop initialization strategy, i.e., the current measured-state is employed for initializing the optimization problem. This new scheme is proven to satisfy the novel definition of recursive feasibility, and its superiority with respect to open-loop initialization schemes, arising from the fact that one never neglects the information brought by the current measurement, is shown through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Advanced Maximum Adhesion Tracking Strategies in Railway Traction Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern railway traction systems are often equipped with anti-slip control strategies to comply with performance and safety requirements. A certain amount of slip is needed to increase the torque transferred by the traction motors onto the rail. Commonly, constant slip control is used to limit the slip velocity between the wheel and rail avoiding excessive slippage and vehicle derailment. This is at the price of not fully utilizing the train's traction and braking capabilities. Finding the slip at which maximum traction force occurs is challenging due to the non-linear relationship between slip and wheel-rail adhesion coefficient, as well as to its dependence on rail and wheel conditions. Perturb and observe (P\&amp;O) and steepest gradient (SG) methods have been reported for the Maximum Adhesion Tracking (MAT) search. However, both methods exhibit weaknesses. Two new MAT strategies are proposed in this paper which overcome the limitations of existing methods, using Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) respectively. Existing and proposed methods are first simulated and further validated experimentally using a scaled roller rig under identical conditions. The results show that the proposed methods improve the traction capability with lower searching time and oscillations compared to existing solutions. Tuning complexity and computational requirements will also be shown to be favorable to the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Formation Control of Non-Holonomic Multi-Robot Systems in Communication-Limited Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust estimator-based safety-critical controller for formation control of non-holonomic mobile robots in communication-limited environments. The proposed decentralized framework integrates a robust state estimator with a formation tracking control law that guarantees inter-agent collision avoidance using control barrier functions. String stability is incorporated into the control design to maintain stability against noise from predecessors in leader-follower formations. Rigorous stability analysis using Lyapunov functions ensures the stability of estimation errors and the convergence of the formation to desired configurations. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are validated through numerical simulations of various maneuvers and realistic Gazebo experiments involving formations in a warehouse environment. The results demonstrate the controller's ability to maintain safety, achieve precise formation control, and mitigate disturbances in scenarios without inter-robot communication.</description>

      <title>COAC: Cross-layer Optimization of Accelerator Configurability for Efficient CNN Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve high accuracy, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly growing in complexity and diversity in layer types and topologies. This makes it very challenging to efficiently deploy such networks on custom processor architectures for resource-scarce edge devices. Existing mapping exploration frameworks enable searching for the optimal execution schedules or hardware mappings of individual network layers, by optimizing each layer's spatial (dataflow parallelization) and temporal unrolling (execution order). However, these tools fail to take into account the overhead of supporting different unrolling schemes within a common hardware architecture. Using a fixed unrolling scheme across all layers is also not ideal, as this misses significant opportunities for energy and latency savings from optimizing the mapping of diverse layer types. A balanced approach assesses the right amount of mapping flexibility needed across target neural networks, while taking into account the overhead to support multiple unrollings. This paper, therefore, presents COAC, a cross-layer design space exploration and mapping framework to optimize the flexibility of neural processing architectures by balancing configurability overhead against resulting energy and latency savings for end-to-end inference. COAC does not only provide a systematical analysis of the architectural overhead in function of the supported spatial unrollings, but also builds an automated flow to find the best unrolling combination(s) for efficient end-to-end inference with limited hardware overhead. Results demonstrate that architectures with carefully optimized flexibility can achieve up to 38% EDP (energy-delay-product) savings for a set of six neural networks at the expense of a relative area increase of 9.5%.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Curves for Optimally Efficient Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as they match liquidity supply with demand. They function through liquidity providers (LPs) who deposit assets into liquidity pools. However, the asset trading prices in these pools often trail behind those in more dynamic, centralized exchanges, leading to potential arbitrage losses for LPs. This issue is tackled by adapting market maker bonding curves to trader behavior, based on the classical market microstructure model of Glosten and Milgrom. Our approach ensures a zero-profit condition for the market maker's prices. We derive the differential equation that an optimal adaptive curve should follow to minimize arbitrage losses while remaining competitive. Solutions to this optimality equation are obtained for standard Gaussian and Lognormal price models using Kalman filtering. A key feature of our method is its ability to estimate the external market price without relying on price or loss oracles. We also provide an equivalent differential equation for the implied dynamics of canonical static bonding curves and establish conditions for their optimality. Our algorithms demonstrate robustness to changing market conditions and adversarial perturbations, and we offer an on-chain implementation using Uniswap v4 alongside off-chain AI co-processors.</description>

      <title>SkyGrid: Energy-Flow Optimization at Harmonized Aerial Intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of urban air mobility (UAM) is reshaping the future of transportation by integrating aerial vehicles into urban transit systems. The design of aerial intersections plays a critical role in the phased development of UAM systems to ensure safe and efficient operations in air corridors. This work adapts the concept of rhythmic control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at unsignalized intersections to address complex traffic control problems. This control framework assigns UAM vehicles to different movement groups and significantly reduces the computation of routing strategies to avoid conflicts. In contrast to ground traffic, the objective is to balance three measures: minimizing energy utilization, maximizing intersection flow (throughput), and maintaining safety distances. This optimization method dynamically directs traffic with various demands, considering path assignment distributions and segment-level trajectory coefficients for straight and curved paths as control variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider a multi-objective optimization approach for unsignalized intersection control in the air and to propose such optimization in a rhythmic control setting with time arrival and UAM operational constraints. A sensitivity analysis with respect to inter-platoon safety and straight/left demand balance demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in handling traffic under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reliable State Estimation in a Truck-Semitrailer Combination using an Artificial Neural Network-Aided Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems are critically dependent on reliable and accurate information regarding a vehicles' driving state. For estimation of unknown quantities, model-based and learning-based methods exist, but both suffer from individual limitations. On the one hand, model-based estimation performance is often limited by the models' accuracy. On the other hand, learning-based estimators usually do not perform well in "unknown" conditions (bad generalization), which is particularly critical for semitrailers as their payload changes significantly in operation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first to analyze the capability of state-of-the-art estimators for semitrailers to generalize across "unknown" loading states. Moreover, a novel hybrid Extended Kalman Filter (H-EKF) that takes advantage of accurate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates while preserving reliable generalization capability is presented. It estimates the articulation angle between truck and semitrailer, lateral tire forces and the truck steering angle utilizing sensor data of a standard semitrailer only. An experimental comparison based on a full-scale truck-semitrailer combination indicates the superiority of the H-EKF compared to a state-of-the-art extended Kalman filter and an ANN estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load balancing and auto scaling are at the core of scalable, contemporary systems, addressing dynamic resource allocation and service rate adjustments in response to workload changes. This paper introduces a novel model and algorithms for tuning load balancers coupled with auto scalers, considering bursty traffic arriving at finite queues. We begin by presenting the problem as a weakly coupled Markov Decision Processes (MDP), solvable via a linear program (LP). However, as the number of control variables of such LP grows combinatorially, we introduce a more tractable relaxed LP formulation, and extend it to tackle the problem of online parameter learning and policy optimization using a two-timescale algorithm based on the LP Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Optimal Power Flow Based Droop Control in MMC-MTDC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing operational set points for modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) transmission systems is crucial for ensuring efficient power distribution and control. This paper presents an enhanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model for MMC-MTDC systems, integrating a novel adaptive voltage droop control strategy. The strategy aims to minimize generation costs and DC voltage deviations while ensuring the stable operation of the MTDC grid by dynamically adjusting the system operation points. The modified Nordic 32 test system with an embedded 4-terminal DC grid is modeled in Julia and the proposed control strategy is applied to the power model. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed droop control strategy, affirming its potential value in enhancing the performance and reliability of hybrid AC-DC power systems.</description>

      <title>Resource Optimization for Tail-Based Control in Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving control stability is one of the key design challenges of scalable Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCS) under limited communication and computing resources. This paper explores the use of an alternative control concept defined as tail-based control, which extends the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) cost function for multiple dynamic control systems over a shared wireless network. We cast the control of multiple control systems as a network-wide optimization problem and decouple it in terms of sensor scheduling, plant state prediction, and control policies. Toward this, we propose a solution consisting of a scheduling algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization for sensing, a mechanism based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for state prediction and uncertainty estimation, and a control policy based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure tail-based control stability. A set of discrete time-invariant mountain car control systems is used to evaluate the proposed solution and is compared against four variants that use state-of-the-art scheduling, prediction, and control methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method yields 22% reduction in overall cost in terms of communication and control resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Ring-LWE based encrypted controller with unlimited number of recursive multiplications and effect of error growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to encrypt linear dynamic controllers that enables an unlimited number of recursive homomorphic multiplications on a Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem without bootstrapping. Unlike LWE based schemes, where a scalar error is injected during encryption for security, Ring-LWE based schemes are based on polynomial rings and inject error as a polynomial having multiple error coefficients. Such errors accumulate under recursive homomorphic operations, and it has been studied that their effect can be suppressed by the closed-loop stability when dynamic controllers are encrypted using LWE based schemes. We show that this also holds for the proposed controller encrypted using a Ring-LWE based scheme. Specifically, only the constant terms of the error polynomials affect the control performance, and their effect can be arbitrarily bounded even when the noneffective terms diverge. Furthermore, a novel packing algorithm is applied, resulting in reduced computation time and enhanced memory efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Deep Neural Network-Based Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety constraints of nonlinear control systems are commonly enforced through the use of control barrier functions (CBFs). Uncertainties in the dynamic model can disrupt forward invariance guarantees or cause the state to be restricted to an overly conservative subset of the safe set. In this paper, adaptive deep neural networks (DNNs) are combined with CBFs to produce a family of controllers that ensure safety while learning the system's dynamics in real-time without the requirement for pre-training. By basing the least squares adaptation law on a state derivative estimator-based identification error, the DNN parameter estimation error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The convergent bound on the parameter estimation error is then used to formulate CBF-constraints in an optimization-based controller to guarantee safety despite model uncertainty. Furthermore, the developed method is applicable for use under intermittent loss of state-feedback. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the ability of the developed method to ensure safety in an adaptive cruise control problem and when feedback is lost, unlike baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Patterns between ENSO and Weather-related Power Outages in the Continental United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exhibits significant impacts on the frequency of extreme weather events and its socio-economic implications prevail on a global scale. However, a fundamental gap still exists in understanding the relationship between the ENSO and weather-related power outages in the continental United States. Through 24-year (2000-2023) composite and statistical analysis, our study reveals that higher power outage numbers (PONs) are observed from the developing winter to the decaying summer of La Ni\~na phases. In particular, during the decaying spring, high La Ni\~na intensity favors the occurrences of power outage over the west coast and east of the United States, by modulating the frequency of extreme precipitations and heatwaves. Furthermore, projected increasing heatwaves from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) indicate that spring-time PONs over the eastern United States occur about 11 times higher for the mid-term future (2041-2060) and almost 26 times higher for the long-term future (2081-2100), compared with 2000-2023. Our study provides a strong recommendation for building a more climate-resilient power system.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Reinforcement Learning of Curative Curtailment with Partial Measurement Availability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03262v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the course of the energy transition, the expansion of generation and consumption will change, and many of these technologies, such as PV systems, electric cars and heat pumps, will influence the power flow, especially in the distribution grids. Scalable methods that can make decisions for each grid connection are needed to enable congestion-free grid operation in the distribution grids. This paper presents a novel end-to-end approach to resolving congestion in distribution grids with deep reinforcement learning. Our architecture learns to curtail power and set appropriate reactive power to determine a non-congested and, thus, feasible grid state. State-of-the-art methods such as the optimal power flow (OPF) demand high computational costs and detailed measurements of every bus in a grid. In contrast, the presented method enables decisions under sparse information with just some buses observable in the grid. Distribution grids are generally not yet fully digitized and observable, so this method can be used for decision-making on the majority of low-voltage grids. On a real low-voltage grid the approach resolves 100\% of violations in the voltage band and 98.8\% of asset overloads. The results show that decisions can also be made on real grids that guarantee sufficient quality for congestion-free grid operation.</description>

      <title>ABNet: Attention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe learning is central to AI-enabled robots where a single failure may lead to catastrophic results. Barrier-based method is one of the dominant approaches for safe robot learning.
  However, this method is not scalable, hard to train, and tends to generate unstable signals under noisy inputs that are challenging to be deployed for robots. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Attention BarrierNet (ABNet) that is scalable to build larger foundational safe models in an incremental manner.
  Each head of BarrierNet in the ABNet could learn safe robot control policies from different features and focus on specific part of the observation. In this way, we do not need to one-shotly construct a large model for complex tasks, which significantly facilitates the training of the model while ensuring its stable output. Most importantly, we can still formally prove the safety guarantees of the ABNet. We demonstrate the strength of ABNet in 2D robot obstacle avoidance, safe robot manipulation, and vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving, with results showing much better robustness and guarantees over existing models.</description>

Abstract: In this study, our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of thruster-assisted steep slope walking for the Husky Carbon, a quadrupedal robot equipped with custom-designed actuators and plural electric ducted fans, through simulation prior to conducting experimental trials. Thruster-assisted steep slope walking draws inspiration from wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) observed in birds, and intriguingly incorporates posture manipulation and thrust vectoring, a locomotion technique not previously explored in the animal kingdom. Our approach involves developing a reduced-order model of the Husky robot, followed by the application of an optimization-based controller utilizing collocation methods and dynamics interpolation to determine control actions. Through simulation testing, we demonstrate the feasibility of hardware implementation of our controller.</description>

      <title>On Computation of Approximate Solutions to Large-Scale Backstepping Kernel Equations via Continuum Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide two methods for computation of continuum backstepping kernels that arise in control of continua (ensembles) of linear hyperbolic PDEs and which can approximate backstepping kernels arising in control of a large-scale, PDE system counterpart (with computational complexity that does not grow with the number of state components of the large-scale system). In the first method, we identify a class of systems for which the solution to the continuum (and hence, also an approximate solution to the respective large-scale) kernel equations can be constructed in closed form. In the second method, we provide explicit formulae for the solution to the continuum kernels PDEs, employing a (triple) power series representation of the continuum kernel and establishing its convergence properties. In this case, we also provide means for reducing computational complexity by properly truncating the power series (in the powers of the ensemble variable). We also present numerical examples to illustrate computational efficiency/accuracy of the approaches, as well as to validate the stabilization properties of the approximate control kernels, constructed based on the continuum.</description>

      <title>Robust Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:A Mean-Field Type Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of robust cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) where a large number of cooperative agents with distributed information aim to learn policies in the presence of \emph{stochastic} and \emph{non-stochastic} uncertainties whose distributions are respectively known and unknown. Focusing on policy optimization that accounts for both types of uncertainties, we formulate the problem in a worst-case (minimax) framework, which is is intractable in general. Thus, we focus on the Linear Quadratic setting to derive benchmark solutions. First, since no standard theory exists for this problem due to the distributed information structure, we utilize the Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) paradigm to establish guarantees on the solution quality in the sense of achieved Nash equilibrium of the MFTG. This in turn allows us to compare the performance against the corresponding original robust multi-agent control problem. Then, we propose a Receding-horizon Gradient Descent Ascent RL algorithm to find the MFTG Nash equilibrium and we prove a non-asymptotic rate of convergence. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach relative to a baseline algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note proposes a novel nonlinear state feedback controller for perturbed second-order systems. In analogy to a linear proportional-derivative (PD) output feedback control, the proposed nonlinear scheme uses the output state of interest and its time derivative for a robust finite-time regulation. The control has only one free design parameter, and the closed-loop system is shown to be uniformly asymptotically stable in the presence of matched disturbances. We derive a strict Lyapunov function for the closed control loop with a bounded exogenous perturbation, and use it for both the control tuning and analysis of the finite-time convergence. Apart from the numerical results, a revealing experimental example is also shown in favor of the proposed control and in comparison with PD and sub-optimal nonlinear damping regulators.</description>

Abstract: The ability to achieve precise and smooth trajectory tracking is crucial for ensuring the successful execution of various tasks involving robotic manipulators. State-of-the-art techniques require accurate mathematical models of the robot dynamics, and robustness to model uncertainties is achieved by relying on precise bounds on the model mismatch. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive robust feedback linearization scheme able to compensate for model uncertainties without any a-priori knowledge on them, and we provide a theoretical proof of convergence under mild assumptions. We evaluate the method on a simulated RR robot. First, we consider a nominal model with known model mismatch, which allows us to compare our strategy with state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware methods. Second, we implement the proposed control law in combination with a learned model, for which uncertainty bounds are not available. Results show that our method leads to performance comparable to uncertainty-aware methods while requiring less prior knowledge.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the robustness of state-of-the-art AI-based models for power grid operations under the $N-1$ security criterion. While these models perform well in regular grid settings, our results highlight a significant loss in accuracy following the disconnection of a line.%under this security criterion. Using graph theory-based analysis, we demonstrate the impact of node connectivity on this loss. Our findings emphasize the need for practical scenario considerations in developing AI methodologies for critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Safe Connectivity Maintenance of Underactuated Multi-Agent Networks in Dynamic Oceanic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems are increasingly being deployed in environments where winds and ocean currents have a significant influence. Recent work has developed control policies for single agents that leverage flows to achieve their objectives in dynamic environments. However, in multi-agent systems, these flows can cause agents to collide or drift apart and lose direct inter-agent communications, especially when agents have low propulsion capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent control approach that allows arbitrary single-agent performance policies that are unaware of other agents to be used in multi-agent systems while ensuring safe operation. We first develop a safety controller using potential functions, solely dedicated to avoiding collisions and maintaining inter-agent communication. Next, we design a low-interference safe interaction (LISIC) policy that trades off the performance policy and the safety control to ensure safe and performant operation. Specifically, when the agents are at an appropriate distance, LISIC prioritizes the performance policy while smoothly increasing the safety controller when necessary. We prove that under mild assumptions on the flows experienced by the agents, our approach can guarantee safety. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in realistic settings through an extensive empirical analysis with simulations of fleets of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles operating in dynamic ocean currents where these assumptions do not always hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the disturbance input matrix is nonlinear, existing disturbance observer design methods rely on the solvability of a partial differential equation or the existence of an output function with a uniformly well-defined disturbance relative degree, which can pose significant limitations. This note introduces a systematic approach for designing an Immersion and Invariance-based Disturbance Observer (IIDOB) that circumvents these strong assumptions. The proposed IIDOB ensures the disturbance estimation error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded by approximately solving a partial differential equation while compensating for the approximation error. Furthermore, by integrating IIDOB into the framework of control barrier functions, a filter-based safe control design method for control-affine systems with disturbances is established where the filter is used to generate an alternative disturbance estimation signal with a known derivative. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the safety of the disturbed systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A nonparametric learning framework for nonlinear robust output regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonparametric learning solution framework is proposed for the global nonlinear robust output regulation problem. We first extend the assumption that the steady-state generator is linear in the exogenous signal to the more relaxed assumption that it is polynomial in the exogenous signal. Additionally, a nonparametric learning framework is proposed to eliminate the construction of an explicit regressor, as required in the adaptive method, which can potentially simplify the implementation and reduce the computational complexity of existing methods. With the help of the proposed framework, the robust nonlinear output regulation problem can be converted into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral input-to-state stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. Moreover, a dynamic gain approach can adaptively raise the gain to a sufficiently large constant to achieve stabilization without requiring any a priori knowledge of the uncertainties appearing in the dynamics of the exosystem and the system. Furthermore, we apply the nonparametric learning framework to globally reconstruct and estimate multiple sinusoidal signals with unknown frequencies without the need for adaptive parametric techniques. An explicit nonlinear mapping can directly provide the estimated parameters, which will exponentially converge to the unknown frequencies. Finally, a feedforward control design is proposed to solve the linear output regulation problem using the nonparametric learning framework. Two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Agent Coordination via Contextual Regression (AgentCONCUR) for Data Center Flexibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A network of spatially distributed data centers can provide operational flexibility to power systems by shifting computing tasks among electrically remote locations. However, harnessing this flexibility in real-time through the standard optimization techniques is challenged by the need for sensitive operational datasets and substantial computational resources. To alleviate the data and computational requirements, this paper introduces a coordination mechanism based on contextual regression. This mechanism, abbreviated as AgentCONCUR, associates cost-optimal task shifts with public and trusted contextual data (e.g., real-time prices) and uses regression on this data as a coordination policy. Notably, regression-based coordination does not learn the optimal coordination actions from a labeled dataset. Instead, it exploits the optimization structure of the coordination problem to ensure feasible and cost-effective actions. A NYISO-based study reveals large coordination gains and the optimal features for the successful regression-based coordination.</description>

Abstract: We consider control of multiple stable first-order \review{agents} which have a control coupling described by an M-matrix. These agents are subject to incremental sector-bounded \review{input} nonlinearities. We show that such plants can be globally asymptotically stabilized to a unique equilibrium using fully decentralized proportional-integral controllers equipped with anti-windup and subject to local tuning rules. In addition, we show that when the nonlinearities correspond to the saturation function, the closed loop asymptotically minimizes a weighted 1-norm of the agents state mismatch. The control strategy is finally compared to other state-of-the-art controllers on a numerical district heating example.</description>

      <title>Signatures Meet Dynamic Programming: Generalizing Bellman Equations for Trajectory Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path signatures have been proposed as a powerful representation of paths that efficiently captures the path's analytic and geometric characteristics, having useful algebraic properties including fast concatenation of paths through tensor products. Signatures have recently been widely adopted in machine learning problems for time series analysis. In this work we establish connections between value functions typically used in optimal control and intriguing properties of path signatures. These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories. We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control. In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable for problems with unknown disturbances. The proposed algorithms are tested in simulation, with differentiable physics models including typical control and robotics tasks such as point-mass, curve following for an ant model, and a robotic manipulator.</description>

      <title>Reachability Analysis Using Constrained Polynomial Logical Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose reachability analysis using constrained polynomial logical zonotopes. We perform reachability analysis to compute the set of states that could be reached. To do this, we utilize a recently introduced set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing computationally efficient and exact reachability analysis on logical systems. Notably, polynomial logical zonotopes address the "curse of dimensionality" when analyzing the reachability of logical systems since the set representation can represent $2^h$ binary vectors using $h$ generators. After finishing the reachability analysis, the formal verification involves verifying whether the intersection of the calculated reachable set and the unsafe set is empty or not. Polynomial logical zonotopes lack closure under intersections, prompting the formulation of constrained polynomial logical zonotopes, which preserve the computational efficiency and exactness of polynomial logical zonotopes for reachability analysis while enabling exact intersections. Additionally, an extensive empirical study is presented to demonstrate and validate the advantages of constrained polynomial logical zonotopes.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic Energy Management Strategies With Interacting Agents in Formula 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an interaction-aware energy management optimization framework for Formula 1 racing. The considered scenario involves two agents and a drag reduction model. Strategic interactions between the agents are captured by a Stackelberg game formulated as a bilevel program. To address the computational challenges associated with bilevel optimization, the problem is reformulated as a single-level nonlinear program employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The proposed framework contributes towards the development of new energy management and allocation strategies, caused by the presence of another agent. For instance, it provides valuable insights on how to redistribute the energy in order to optimally exploit the wake effect, showcasing a notable difference with the behavior studied in previous works. Robust energy allocations can be identified to reduce the lap time loss associated with unexpected choices of the other agent. It allows to recognize the boundary conditions for the interaction to become relevant, impacting the system's behavior, and to assess if overtaking is possible and beneficial. Overall, the framework provides a comprehensive approach for a two-agent Formula 1 racing problem with strategic interactions, offering physically intuitive and practical results.</description>

      <title>Log-Scale Quantization in Distributed First-Order Methods: Gradient-based Learning from Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized strategies are of interest for learning from large-scale data over networks. This paper studies learning over a network of geographically distributed nodes/agents subject to quantization. Each node possesses a private local cost function, collectively contributing to a global cost function, which the proposed methodology aims to minimize. In contrast to many existing literature, the information exchange among nodes is quantized. We adopt a first-order computationally-efficient distributed optimization algorithm (with no extra inner consensus loop) that leverages node-level gradient correction based on local data and network-level gradient aggregation only over nearby nodes. This method only requires balanced networks with no need for stochastic weight design. It can handle log-scale quantized data exchange over possibly time-varying and switching network setups. We analyze convergence over both structured networks (for example, training over data-centers) and ad-hoc multi-agent networks (for example, training over dynamic robotic networks). Through analysis and experimental validation, we show that (i) structured networks generally result in a smaller optimality gap, and (ii) logarithmic quantization leads to smaller optimality gap compared to uniform quantization.</description>

      <title>Fast Geometric Learning of MIMO Signal Detection over Grassmannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain or statistical distribution shifts are a key staple of the wireless communication channel, because of the dynamics of the environment. Deep learning (DL) models for detecting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals in dynamic communication require large training samples (in the order of hundreds of thousands to millions) and online retraining to adapt to domain shift. Some dynamic networks, such as vehicular networks, cannot tolerate the waiting time associated with gathering a large number of training samples or online fine-tuning which incurs significant end-to-end delay. In this paper, a novel classification technique based on the concept of geodesic flow kernel (GFK) is proposed for MIMO signal detection. In particular, received MIMO signals are first represented as points on Grassmannian manifolds by formulating basis of subspaces spanned by the rows vectors of the received signal. Then, the domain shift is modeled using a geodesic flow kernel integrating the subspaces that lie on the geodesic to characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties of the received signals. The kernel derives low-dimensional representations of the received signals over the Grassman manifolds that are invariant to domain shift and is used in a geometric support vector machine (G-SVM) algorithm for MIMO signal detection in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method achieves promising performance against the existing baselines like OAMPnet and MMNet with only 1,200 training samples and without online retraining.</description>

      <title>GridSweep Simulation: Measuring Subsynchronous Impedance Spectra of Distribution Feeder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peaks and troughs in the subsynchronous impedance spectrum of a distribution feeder may be a useful indication of oscillation risk, or more importantly lack of oscillation risk, if inverter-based resource (IBR) deployments are increased on that feeder. GridSweep is a new instrument for measuring the subsynchronous impedance spectra of distribution feeders. It combines an active probing device that modulates a 120-volt 1-kW load sinusoidally at a user-selected GPS-phase locked frequency from 1.0 to 40.0 Hz, and with a recorder that takes ultra-high-precision continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) 120-volt synchrowaveforms at 4 kHz. This paper presents a computer simulation of GridSweep's probing and measurement capability. We construct an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation of a single-phase distribution feeder equipped with multiple inverter-based resources (IBRs). We include a model of the GridSweep probing device, then demonstrate the model's capability to measure the subsynchronous apparent impedance spectrum of the feeder. Peaks in that spectrum align with the system's dominant oscillation modes caused by IBRs.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs between convergence rate and noise amplification for momentum-based accelerated optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study momentum-based first-order optimization algorithms in which the iterations utilize information from the two previous steps and are subject to an additive white noise. This setup uses noise to account for uncertainty in either gradient evaluation or iteration updates, and it includes Polyak's heavy-ball and Nesterov's accelerated methods as special cases. For strongly convex quadratic problems, we use the steady-state variance of the error in the optimization variable to quantify noise amplification and identify fundamental stochastic performance tradeoffs. Our approach utilizes the Jury stability criterion to provide a novel geometric characterization of conditions for linear convergence, and it reveals the relation between the noise amplification and convergence rate as well as their dependence on the condition number and the constant algorithmic parameters. This geometric insight leads to simple alternative proofs of standard convergence results and allows us to establish ``uncertainty principle'' of strongly convex optimization: for the two-step momentum method with linear convergence rate, the lower bound on the product between the settling time and noise amplification scales quadratically with the condition number. Our analysis also identifies a key difference between the gradient and iterate noise models: while the amplification of gradient noise can be made arbitrarily small by sufficiently decelerating the algorithm, the best achievable variance for the iterate noise model increases linearly with the settling time in the decelerating regime. Finally, we introduce two parameterized families of algorithms that strike a balance between noise amplification and settling time while preserving order-wise Pareto optimality for both noise models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Logically Constrained Partially Observable and Multi-Agent Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems often have logical constraints arising, for example, from safety, operational, or regulatory requirements. Such constraints can be expressed using temporal logic specifications. The system state is often partially observable. Moreover, it could encompass a team of multiple agents with a common objective but disparate information structures and constraints. In this paper, we first introduce an optimal control theory for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with finite linear temporal logic constraints. We provide a structured methodology for synthesizing policies that maximize a cumulative reward while ensuring that the probability of satisfying a temporal logic constraint is sufficiently high. Our approach comes with guarantees on approximate reward optimality and constraint satisfaction. We then build on this approach to design an optimal control framework for logically constrained multi-agent settings with information asymmetry. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing it on several case studies.</description>

      <title>Vessim: A Testbed for Carbon-Aware Applications and Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To reduce the carbon footprint of computing and stabilize electricity grids, there is an increasing focus on approaches that align the power usage of IT infrastructure with the availability of clean energy. Unfortunately, research on energy-aware and carbon-aware applications, as well as the interfaces between computing and energy systems, remains complex due to the scarcity of available testing environments. To this day, almost all new approaches are evaluated on custom simulation testbeds, which leads to repeated development efforts and limited comparability of results.
  In this paper, we present Vessim, a co-simulation environment for testing applications and computing systems that interact with their energy systems. Our testbed connects domain-specific simulators for renewable power generation and energy storage, and enables users to implement interfaces to integrate real systems through software and hardware-in-the-loop simulation. Vessim offers an easy-to-use interface, is extendable to new simulators, and provides direct access to historical datasets. We aim to not only accelerate research in carbon-aware computing but also facilitate development and operation, as in continuous testing or digital twins. Vessim is publicly available: https://github.com/dos-group/vessim.</description>

      <title>Using power system modelling outputs to identify weather-induced extreme events in highly renewable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In highly renewable power systems the increased weather dependence can result in new resilience challenges, such as renewable energy droughts, or a lack of sufficient renewable generation at times of high demand. The weather conditions responsible for these challenges have been well-studied in the literature. However, in reality multi-day resilience challenges are triggered by complex interactions between high demand, low renewable availability, electricity transmission constraints and storage dynamics. We show these challenges cannot be rigorously understood from an exclusively power systems, or meteorological, perspective. We propose a new method that uses electricity shadow prices - obtained by a European power system model based on 40 years of reanalysis data - to identify the most difficult periods driving system investments. Such difficult periods are driven by large-scale weather conditions such as low wind and cold temperature periods of various lengths associated with stationary high pressure over Europe. However, purely meteorological approaches fail to identify which events lead to the largest system stress over the multi-decadal study period due to the influence of subtle transmission bottlenecks and storage issues across multiple regions. These extreme events also do not relate strongly to traditional weather patterns (such as Euro-Atlantic weather regimes or the North Atlantic Oscillation index). We therefore compile a new set of weather patterns to define energy system stress events which include the impacts of electricity storage and large-scale interconnection. Without interdisciplinary studies combining state-of-the-art energy meteorology and modelling, further strive for adequate renewable power systems will be hampered.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint mechanical and electrical adjustment of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for the performance improvements of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. In particular, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) MIMO channel model for the mechanically-tilted IRS in general deployment, and consider two types of scenarios with and without the direct path of LEO-ground user link due to the orbital flight. With the aim of maximizing the end-to-end performance, we jointly optimize tilting angle and phase shift of IRS along with the transceiver beamforming, whose performance superiority is verified via simulations with the Orbcomm LEO satellite using a real orbit data.</description>

      <title>Resource-Aware Hierarchical Federated Learning in Wireless Video Caching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks. Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>The Loewner framework for parametric systems: Taming the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory approach designed for approximating linear and nonlinear systems. The goal here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. One main innovation established here is the construction of data-based realizations for any number of parameters. Equally importantly, we show how to alleviate the computational burden, by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. This reduces the complexity from $O(N^3)$ to about $O(N^{1.4})$, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is defined. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a coupled set of Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices then allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric transfer function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic computational burden reduction. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating and updating the obstacle avoidance velocity for an autonomous robot in real-time ensures robustness against noise and disturbances. A passive damping controller can obtain the desired motion with a torque-controlled robot, which remains compliant and ensures a safe response to external perturbations. Here, we propose a novel approach for designing the passive control policy. Our algorithm complies with obstacle-free zones while transitioning to increased damping near obstacles to ensure collision avoidance. This approach ensures stability across diverse scenarios, effectively mitigating disturbances. Validation on a 7DoF robot arm demonstrates superior collision rejection capabilities compared to the baseline, underlining its practicality for real-world applications. Our obstacle-aware damping controller represents a substantial advancement in secure robot control within complex and uncertain environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the receiver to transmitter antenna coupling in near-field communications with massive arrays. Although most works in the literature consider that it is negligible and approximate it by zero, there is no rigorous analysis on its relevance for practical systems. In this work, we leverage multiport communication theory to obtain conditions for the aforementioned approximation to be valid in MISO and SIMO systems. These conditions are then particularized for arrays with fixed inter-element spacing and arrays with fixed size.</description>

      <title>Control of Unknown Quadrotors from a Single Throw</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a method to recover quadrotor UAV from a throw, when no control parameters are known before the throw. We leverage the availability of high-frequency rotor speed feedback available in racing drone hardware and software to find control effectiveness values and fit a motor model using recursive least squares (RLS) estimation. Furthermore, we propose an excitation sequence that provides large actuation commands while guaranteeing to stay within gyroscope sensing limits. After 450ms of excitation, an INDI attitude controller uses the 52 fitted parameters to arrest rotational motion and recover an upright attitude. Finally, a NDI position controller drives the craft to a position setpoint. The proposed algorithm runs efficiently on microcontrollers found in common UAV flight controllers, and was shown to recover an agile quadrotor every time in 57 live experiments with as low as 3.5m throw height, demonstrating robustness against initial rotations and noise. We also demonstrate control of randomized quadrotors in simulated throws, where the parameter fitting RMS error is typically within 10% of the true value.</description>
