      <title>Soft Error Rate in Space: A Unified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new physics-based model for analytical calculation of Soft Error Rate (SER) in digital memory circuits under the influence of heavy ions in space orbits is proposed. This method is based on parameters that are uniquely determined from the results of ground tests under nor-mal ion incidence. It is shown that preliminary averaging over the total solid angle within the standard inverse cosine model allows one to take into account the effect of isotropic flow, which increases the effective SER. The model includes the ability to estimate the contribution to SER of the low LET spectrum region, which is very important for modern ICs with low Single Event Upset tolerance.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Tunable Generation of Random Number Distributions Using Actuated Perpendicular Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) actuated by nanosecond pulses are emerging as promising devices for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic behavior and high throughput. In this work, we study the tunability and quality of random-number distributions generated by pMTJs operating at a frequency of 104 MHz. First, changing the pulse amplitude is used to systematically vary the probability bias. The variance of the resulting bitstreams is shown to follow the expected binomial distribution. Second, the quality of uniform distributions of 8-bit random numbers generated with a probability bias of 0.5 is considered. A reduced chi-square analysis of this data shows that two XOR operations are necessary to achieve this distribution with p-values greater than 0.05. Finally, we show that there is a correlation between long-term probability bias variations and pMTJ resistance. These findings suggest that variations in the characteristics of the pMTJ underlie the observed variation of probability bias. Our results highlight the potential of stochastically actuated pMTJs for high-speed, tunable TRNG applications, showing the importance of the stability of pMTJs device characteristics in achieving reliable, long-term performance.</description>

      <title>Feedback-enhanced squeezing or cooling of fluctuations in a parametric resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we analyse ways to achieve deep subthreshold parametric squeezing of fluctuations beyond the $-6$~dB limit of single degree-of-freedom parametric resonators. One way of accomplishing this is via a lock-in amplifier feedback loop. Initially, we calculate the phase-dependent parametric amplification with feedback of an added ac signal. In one approach, we use the averaging method to obtain the amplification gain, while in the second approach, we obtain the ac response of the parametric amplifier with feedback using the harmonic balance method. In this latter approach, the feedback is proportional to an integral term that emulates the cosine quadrature output of a lock-in amplifier multiplied by a sine at the same tone of the lock-in. We find that the gain obtained via these two methods are the same whenever the integration time span of the integral is a multiple of the tone period. When this is not the case, we can obtain considerable deamplification. Finally, we analyse the response of the parametric resonator with feedback, described by this integro-differential model, to an added white noise in the frequency domain. Using this model we were able to calculate, in addition to squeezing, the noise spectral density in this resonator with feedback. Very strong squeezing or cooling can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Meta-microperforated-panels for ultrabroadband directional and omnidirectional sound absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional microperforated panels (MPPs) and metamaterial-based sound absorbers rely on local resonances or multi-resonator designs, which limit their bandwidth, angular applicability, and ease of fabrication. Leveraging the reciprocity theorem and cavity resonances, we introduce a new class of robust MPP absorbers, termed meta-MPPs, capable of achieving ultrabroadband near-total sound absorption across a range of 0.37 to 10 kHz. These absorbers demonstrate average performance exceeding that of traditional MPPs by over 100%, approaching the theoretical causality limit. Notably, their absorption performance can be tuned between angularly asymmetric and omnidirectional modes and remains highly robust to variations in MPP parameters and geometrical configurations. Validated through simulations and experiments, our findings present a simpler, more robust, and highly adaptable solution for noise control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic reconstruction of multiphase composite microstructures using statistics-encoded neural network for poro/micro-mechanical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding microstructure-property relationships (MPRs) is essential for optimising the performance of multiphase composites. Image-based poro/micro-mechanical modelling provides a non-invasive approach to exploring MPRs, but the randomness of multiphase composites often necessitates extensive 3D microstructure datasets for statistical reliability. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning framework to reconstruct numerous virtual 3D microstructures from limited 2D exemplars, circumventing the high costs of volumetric microscopy. Using feedforward neural networks, termed the statistics-encoded neural network (SENN), the framework encodes 2D morphological statistics and infers 3D morphological statistics via a 2D-to-3D integration scheme. Statistically equivalent 3D microstructures are synthesised using Gibbs sampling. Hierarchical characterisation enables seamless capture of features across multiple scales. Validation on three composites demonstrates strong statistical equivalence between reconstructed and reference microstructures, confirmed by morphological descriptors and simulated macroscopic properties (e.g., stiffness, permeability). The SENN-based framework is a high-fidelity tool for efficiently and accurately reconstructing multiphase microstructures.</description>

      <title>Sensing with near-infrared laser trapped fluorescent nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biosensing based on optically trapped fluorescent nanodiamonds is an intriguing research direction potentially allowing to resolve biochemical processes inside living cells. Towards this goal, we investigate infrared near (NIR) laser irradiation at 1064 nm on fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we aim to understand how NIR exposure influences the fluorescence and sensing properties of FNDs and to determine the potential implications for the use of FNDs in various sensing applications. The experimental setup involved exposing FNDs to varying intensities of NIR laser light and analyzing the resultant changes in their optical and physical properties. Key measurements included T1 relaxation times, optical spectroscopy, and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra. The findings reveal how increased NIR laser power correlates with alterations in ODMR central frequency but also that charge state dynamics under NIR irradiation of NV centers plays a role. We suggest protocols with NIR and green light that mitigate the effect of NIR, and demonstrate that FND biosensing works well with such a protocol.</description>

      <title>Sensing the vibration of non-reflective surfaces with 10-dB-squeezed-light enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser light with squeezed quantum uncertainty is a powerful tool for interferometric sensing. A routine application can be found in gravitational wave observatories. A significant quantum advantage is only achievable if a large fraction of the photons are actually measured. For this reason, quantum-enhanced vibrational measurements of strongly absorbing or scattering surfaces have not been considered so far. Here we demonstrate the strongly quantum-enhanced measurement of the frequency characteristics of surface vibrations in air by measuring the air pressure wave instead. Our squeezed laser beam, which simply passes the vibrating surface, delivers a sensitivity that an ultra-stable conventional light beam in the same configuration can only achieve with ten times the power. The pressure amplitude of a ultrasonic wave of just 0.12 mPa/ Hz was clearly visible with a spatial resolution in the millimetre range and a 1 kHz resolution bandwidth. We envision applications in sensor technology where distant, highly absorbing or optically inaccessible surface vibrations in air are to be measured with limited, e.g. eye-safe, light powers.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Electron Plume within a Scanning Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a century-old technique, is today a ubiquitous method of imaging the surface of nanostructures. However, most SEM detectors simply count the number of secondary electrons from a material of interest, and thereby overlook the rich material information contained within them. Here, by simple modifications to a standard SEM tool, we resolve the momentum and energy information of secondary electrons by directly imaging the electron plume generated by the electron beam of the SEM. Leveraging these spectroscopic imaging capabilities, our technique is able to image lateral electric fields across a prototypical silicon p-n junctions and to distinguish differently doped regions, even when buried beyond depths typically accessible by SEM. Intriguingly, the sub-surface sensitivity of this technique reveals unexpectedly strong surface band bending within nominally passivated semiconductor structures, providing useful insights for complex layered component designs, in which interfacial dynamics dictate device operation. These capabilities for non-invasive, multi-modal probing of complicated electronic components are crucial in today's electronic manufacturing but is largely inaccessible even with sophisticated techniques. These results show that seemingly simple SEM can be extended to probe complex and useful material properties.</description>

      <title>Ultra-compact broadband spot size converter using metamaterial cell-based inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06390v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the expansion of silicon photonics from datacom applications into emerging fields like optical I/O, quantum and programmable photonics there is an increasing demand for devices that combine ultra-compact footprints, low losses, and broad bandwidths. While inverse design techniques have proven very efficient in achieving small footprints, they often underutilize physical insight and rely on large parameter spaces that are challenging to explore, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting devices. Here we present a design methodology that combines inverse design with a topology based on cells, each of which contains a subwavelength metamaterial. This approach significantly reduces the parameter space, while the inherent anisotropy of the subwavelength structures yields shorter devices. We experimentally demonstrate our technique with an ultra-compact spot size converter that achieves a x24 expansion ratio times (from 0.5 um to 12 um) over a length of only 7 um, with insertion losses of 0.8 dB across a measured bandwidth of 160 nm (up to 300 nm in simulation), surpassing the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.</description>

      <title>High-pressure growth effect on the properties of high-Tc iron-based superconductors: A short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-pressure growth technique is a vital approach that facilitates the stabilization of new phases and allows for meticulous control of structural parameters, which significantly impact electronic and magnetic properties. We present a short review of our ongoing investigations into various families of iron-based superconductors (IBS), employing the high-gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. This technique is capable of producing the gas pressures up to 1.8 GPa and a heating temperature of up to 1700 {\deg}C through a three-zone furnace within a cylindrical chamber. Different kinds of IBS samples are prepared using HPHTS and characterized through various measurements to reach the final conclusions. The results demonstrate that the high-pressure growth technique significantly enhances the properties of IBS, including the transition temperature, critical current density, and pinning force. In addition, the quality of the samples and their density are improved through the intergrain connections. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluations and investigations prove that a growth pressure of 0.5 GPa is sufficient for producing high-quality IBS bulks under the optimized synthesis conditions.</description>

      <title>Fatigue-free ferroelectricity in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ultrathin films via interfacial design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to traits of CMOS compatibility and scalability, HfO2-based ferroelectrics are promising candidates for next-generation memory devices. However, their commercialization has been greatly hindered by reliability issues, with fatigue being a major impediment. We report the fatigue-free behavior in interface-designed Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based heterostructures. A coherent CeO2-x/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 heterointerface is constructed, wherein CeO2-x acts as an oxygen sponge, capable of reversibly accepting and releasing oxygen vacancies. This design effectively alleviates defect aggregation at the electrode-ferroelectric interface, enabling improved switching characteristics. Further, a symmetric capacitor architecture is designed to minimize the imprint, thereby suppressing the cycling-induced oriented defect drift. The two-pronged technique mitigates oxygen-voltammetry-generated chemical/energy fluctuations, suppressing the formation of paraelectric phase and polarization degradation. The design ensures a fatigue-free feature exceeding 10^11 switching cycles and an endurance lifetime surpassing 10^12 cycles for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based capacitors, along with excellent temperature stability and retention. These findings pave the way for developing ultra-stable hafnia-based ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Compact Model of Linear Passive Integrated Photonics Device for Photon Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As integrated photonic systems grow in scale and complexity, Photonic Design Automation (PDA) tools and Process Design Kits (PDKs) have become increasingly important for layout and simulation. However, fixed PDKs often fail to meet the rising demand for customization, compelling designers to spend significant time on geometry optimization using FDTD, EME, and BPM simulations. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven Eigenmode Propagation Method (DEPM) based on the unitary evolution of optical waveguides, along with a compact model derived from intrinsic waveguide Hamiltonians. The relevant parameters are extracted via complex coupled-mode theory. Once constructed, the compact model enables millisecond-scale simulations that achieve accuracy on par with 3D FDTD, within the model's valid scope. Moreover, this method can swiftly evaluate the effects of manufacturing variations on device and system performance, including both random phase errors and polarization-sensitive components. The data-driven EPM thus provides an efficient and flexible solution for future photonic design automation, promising further advancements in integrated photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>On the optical field confinement at the anapole mode in nanohole silicon metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, researchers demonstrated numerous types of the metasurfaces with non-radiating states including the anapole ones. These metasurfaces have promising properties for various applications in optics which are mainly connected with the optical field confinement. But by itself, the existence of the anapole state does not make one available to exploit this feature. For example, Ospanova et al. [\textit{Laser \&amp; Photonics Rev.}, 2018, vol. 12, p. 1800005] presented a grouped nanohole array in silicon slab possessing anapole mode in visible range. In this work, it is proved that despite of the existence of the anapole mode in the proposed nanostructure the valuable electric field confinement is not reached. Thus most expected uses of the anapole state cannot be gained through this nanostructure. As demonstrated here, the aforementioned nanostructure may be replaced by the square nanohole array having the anapole state with different meta-atom and much larger electric field confinement.</description>

      <title>Full C- and L-band tunable erbium-doped integrated lasers via scalable manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erbium (Er) ions are the gain medium of choice for fiber-based amplifiers and lasers, offering a long excited-state lifetime, slow gain relaxation, low amplification nonlinearity and noise, and temperature stability compared to semiconductor-based platforms. Recent advances in ultra-low-loss silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits, combined with ion implantation, have enabled the realization of high-power on-chip Er amplifiers and lasers with performance comparable to fiber-based counterparts, supporting compact photonic systems. Yet, these results are limited by the high (2 MeV) implantation beam energy required for tightly confined Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides (700 nm height), preventing volume manufacturing of Er-doped photonic integrated circuits. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate the first fully wafer-scale, foundry-compatible Er-doped photonic integrated circuit-based tunable lasers. Using 200 nm-thick Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides, we reduce the ion beam energy requirement to below 500 keV, enabling efficient wafer-scale implantation with an industrial 300 mm ion implanter. We demonstrate a laser wavelength tuning range of 91 nm, covering nearly the entire optical C- and L-bands, with fiber-coupled output power reaching 36 mW and an intrinsic linewidth of 95 Hz. The temperature-insensitive properties of erbium ions allowed stable laser operation up to 125$^{\circ}$C and lasing with less than 15 MHz drift for over 6 hours at room temperature using a remote fiber pump. The fully scalable, low-cost fabrication of Er-doped waveguide lasers opens the door for widespread adoption in coherent communications, LiDAR, microwave photonics, optical frequency synthesis, and free-space communications.</description>

      <title>Impact of impurities on leakage current induced by High-Energy Density Pulsed Laser Annealing in Si diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For semiconductor device fabrication, Pulsed Laser Annealing (PLA) offers significant advantages over conventional thermal processes. Notably, it can provide ultrafast (~ns) and high temperature profiles ($&gt;1000^\circ$C). When the maximum temperature exceeds the melting point, a solid-liquid phase transition is observed, immediately followed by rapid recrystallization. This unique annealing mechanism gives raises questions about dopant diffusion and residual defects, in not only in the recrystallized region, but also just below it. As power devices require micrometer-sized junctions, high laser energy densities are needed, which were proved to promote the incorporation of complex impurities from the surface and the creation of defects at the liquid/solid interface. This paper reports on the impact of laser annealing at high energy densities (up to 8.0 J/cm$^2$) on the leakage current, using Schottky and PN diodes, and DLTS measurements. Various laser annealing conditions were used: energy densities between 1.7 and 8.0 J/cm$^2$ with 1 to 10 pulses. Our results suggest that the liquid and solid solubility of vacancies in silicon are fixed by the maximum temperature reached, so to the energy density. Increasing the number of laser pulses allows, not only to reach this maximum vacancy concentration but also to promote their diffusion towards the surface. Concomitantly, the in-diffusion of complex impurities inside the melted region allows the coupling between both defect types to create trap centers, responsible for the degradation of the leakage current.</description>

Abstract: The directional coupler is a fundamental element of wave-based circuits. The state of the art for the spin-wave directional couplers consists mostly of macroscopic waveguides or two-dimensional planar systems. In this Letter, we present the design of the nanoscale spin-wave vertical directional coupler with a very high efficiency exceeding 99.5%. We demonstrate that the operation of the coupler can be controlled by the magnitude of the external magnetic field. Moreover, it can perform multiplexing and demultiplexing of the spin-wave signal. Such a device ought to become an essential element of the three-dimensional magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.</description>

      <title>Radiation Resilience of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Barrier Diodes Under High Dose Gamma Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic investigation of the electrical characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) has been conducted under high-dose 60Co gamma radiation, with total cumulative doses reaching up to 5 Mrad (Si). Initial exposure of the diodes to 1 Mrad resulted in a significant decrease in on-current and an increase in on-resistance compared to the pre-radiation condition, likely due to the generation of radiation-induced deep-level acceptor traps. However, upon exposure to higher gamma radiation doses of 3 and 5 Mrad, partial recovery of the device performance occurred, attributed to a radiation annealing effect. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) characterization revealed that the net carrier concentration in the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ drift layer reduced from $\sim$3.19 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $\sim$3.05 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ after 5 Mrad (Si) irradiation. Temperature-dependent I-V characteristics showed that irradiation leads to a reduction in both forward and reverse current across all investigated temperatures ranging from 25 to 250$^\circ$C, accompanied by slight increases in on-resistance, ideality factors, and Schottky barrier heights. The reverse breakdown characteristics of the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ SBDs showed a slight increase of the breakdown voltage after radiation. Overall, $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky diode exhibits high resilience to gamma irradiation, with performance degradation mitigated by radiation-induced self-recovery, highlighting its potential for radiation-hardened electronic applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Thermal Properties in Multilayer Systems for Advanced Thermoreflectance Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, including time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are powerful tools for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, accurately interpreting their signals remains challenging due to intricate interdependencies among experimental variables. This study introduces a systematic framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to decouple these interdependent parameters and enhance the reliability of thermal property extraction. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify key parameter combinations and establish essential dimensionless numbers that govern thermoreflectance signals. The framework is applied to a GaN/Si heterostructure, where the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS is evaluated and compared. The results demonstrate a high degree of consistency across all three techniques. Notably, with the intricate relationships of parameters unraveled, TDTR, FDTR, and SPS demonstrate significant potential to simultaneously and accurately extract five to seven key thermal properties, including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance of the GaN/Si multilayer system. This framework not only improves the precision of thermoreflectance measurements but also lays a foundation for advanced thermal metrology in research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>MOCVD growth and band offsets of \k{appa}-phase Ga2O3 on sapphire, GaN, AlN and YSZ substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epitaxial growth of \k{appa}-phase Ga2O3 thin films are investigated on c-plane sapphire, GaN- and AlNon-sapphire, and (100) oriented yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The structural and surface morphological properties are investigated by comprehensive material characterization. Phase pure \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films are successfully grown on GaN-, AlN-on sapphire, and YSZ substrates through a systematical tuning of the growth parameters including the precursor molar flow rates, chamber pressure and growth temperature, whereas the growth on c-sapphire substrates leads to a mixture of \b{eta}- and \k{appa}polymorphs of Ga2O3 under the investigated growth conditions. The influence of the crystalline structure, surface morphology and roughness of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films grown on different substrates are investigated as a function of precursor flow rate. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films reveals abrupt interfaces between the epitaxial film and the sapphire, GaN and YSZ substrates. The growth of single crystal orthorhombic \k{appa}Ga2O3 films is confirmed by analyzing the STEM nano-diffraction pattern. The chemical composition, surface stoichiometry, and the bandgap energies of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 thin films grown on different substrates are studied by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The type-II (staggered) band alignments at three interfaces between \k{appa}-Ga2O3 and c-sapphire, AlN, and YSZ substrates are determined by XPS, with the exception of \k{appa}-Ga2O3/GaN interface, which shows type I (straddling) band alignment.</description>

      <title>Detecting charge transfer at defects in 2D materials with electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04469v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic charge transfer at the atomic scale can reveal fundamental information about chemical bonding, but is far more challenging to directly image than the atomic structure. The charge density is dominated by the atomic nuclei, with bonding causing only a small perturbation. Thus detecting any change due to bonding requires a higher level of sensitivity than imaging structure and the overall charge density. Here we achieve the sensitivity required to detect charge transfer in both pristine and defected monolayer WS\textsubscript{2} using the high dose efficiency of electron ptychography and its ability to correct for lens aberrations. Excellent agreement is achieved with first-principles image simulations including where thermal diffuse scattering is explicitly modeled via finite-temperature molecular dynamics based on density functional theory. The focused-probe ptychography configuration we use also provides the important ability to concurrently collect the annular dark-field signal, which can be unambiguously interpreted in terms of the atomic structure and chemical identity of the atoms, independently of the charge transfer. Our results demonstrate both the power of ptychographic reconstructions and the importance of quantitatively accurate simulations to aid their interpretation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the FR4 Microwave Dielectric Properties at Cryogenic Temperature for Quantum-Chip-Interface PCBs Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ad-hoc interface PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) are today the standard connection between cryogenic cabling and quantum chips. Besides low-loss and low-temperature-dependent-dielectric-permittivity materials, Flame Resistance n.4 (FR4) provides a low-cost solution for fabrication of cryogenic PCBs. Here, we report on an effective way to evaluate the dielectric performance of a FR4 laminate used as substrate for cryogenic microwave PCBs. We designed a coplanar waveguide {\lambda}/2 open-circuit series resonator, and we fabricated the PCB using a low-cost manufacturing process, obtaining in-plane geometric features with maximum variations of 50-100 um compared to the PCB design. Such a geometry allows to exploit the resonance peak of the resonator to measure the variation of the complex permittivity as a function of the temperature. The resonance peak frequency was used to estimate the real permittivity, achieving a sensitivity of -470 MHz and a resolution of 1.2x10^-2. Similarly, the resonance peak magnitude was involved in the extrapolation of the loss tangent, reaching a sensitivity of ~-337 dB and a resolution of 1.6x^10-4. For the FR4 laminate used, we estimated a 9 % reduction of the real permittivity and a 70 % reduction of the loss tangent in the temperature range from 300 to 4 K. The proposed approach can be immediately extended to the detection of cryogenic temperature-dependent dielectric performance of any kind of substrate.</description>

      <title>Laser mode-hopping assisted all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer assisted by laser mode-hopping in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. We implement a temporal sequence of the laser current, with sinusoidal current modulation including the laser mode-hop current for synchronous optical pumping, and a following constant current for paramagnetic Faraday rotation measurements, to probe the free induction decay (FID) of transverse $^{87}$Rb spin polarization. Repetitive sudden frequency shifts of 20 GHz around the pressure-broadened $^{87}$Rb spectra, originating from laser mode-hopping, enable discontinuous optical pumping modulation with a large depth, which enhances transverse spin polarization. We achieved a sensitivity of 0.6 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ in a magnetic field of 27 $\mu$T, mainly limited by the photon-shot-noise and the magnetic field noise induced by the current noise in the current supply for driving the bias magnetic field coil. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the sensitivity due to the non-magnetic noise such as photon shot-noise is 131 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. Our approach based on laser mode-hopping can be applied for the miniaturization of all-optical atomic magnetometers with sub-pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Toward thermoelectric characterization of (nano)materials by in situ transmission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to perform an in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in-situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in-situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand fundamental aspects of thermoelectricity, which is exemplary demonstrated by tracking the thermovoltage during in-situ crystallization of an amorphous Ge thin film. We propose an improved in-situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient. The benefit of the in-situ approach is the possibility to directly correlate the thermoelectric properties with the structure and chemical composition of the entire studied device down to the atomic level, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects, and to trace its dynamic evolution upon heating or during the application of electrical currents</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for charge transport in GNRs through particle Galerkin methods for the semiclassical Boltzmann equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some issues related to the quantification of uncertainties associated with the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons. The approach is suited to understand the effects of missing information linked to the difficulty of fixing some material parameters, such as the band gap, and the strength of the applied electric field. In particular, we focus on the extension of particle Galerkin methods for kinetic equations in the case of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for charge transport in graphene nanoribbons with uncertainties. To this end, we develop an efficient particle scheme which allows us to parallelize the computation and then, after a suitable generalization of the scheme to the case of random inputs, we present a Galerkin reformulation of the particle dynamics, obtained by means of a generalized Polynomial Chaos approach, which allows the reconstruction of the kinetic distribution. As a consequence, the proposed particle-based scheme preserves the physical properties and the positivity of the distribution function also in the presence of a complex scattering in the transport equation of electrons. The impact of the uncertainty of the band gap and applied field on the electrical current is analysed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Improved Current Density Reconstruction from 2D Vector Magnetic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of electrical current densities from magnetic field measurements is an important technique with applications in materials science, circuit design, quality control, plasma physics, and biology. Analytic reconstruction methods exist for planar currents, but break down in the presence of high spatial frequency noise or large standoff distance, restricting the types of systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate the use of a deep convolutional neural network for current density reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) images of vector magnetic fields acquired by a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) utilizing a surface layer of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Trained network performance significantly exceeds analytic reconstruction for data with high noise or large standoff distances. This machine learning technique can perform quality inversions on lower SNR data, reducing the data collection time by a factor of about 400 and permitting reconstructions of weaker and three-dimensional current sources.</description>

      <title>Effects of heating strategies and ballistic transport on the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently capturing the three-dimensional spatiotemporal distributions of temperature is of great significance for alleviating hotspot issues in 3D FinFETs. However, most previous thermal simulations mainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating. Few studies are conducted for the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs with non-continuous heating, which is actually closer to the reality. To investigate the effects of heating strategies on the transient micro/nano scale thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs, three heating strategies are considered, including `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. A comparison is made between the phonon BTE solutions and the data predicted by the macroscopic diffusion equation, where the effect of boundary scattering on phonon transport is added into the effective thermal conductivity. Numerical results show that it is not easy to accurately capture the heat conduction in 3D FinFETs by the macroscopic diffusion equation, especially near the hotspot areas where ballistic phonon transport dominates and the temperature diffusion is no longer valid. Different heating strategies have great influence on the peak temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to `Intermittent' or `Continuous' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is smaller.</description>

      <title>Blueprint for Diamond Magnetometry: Unraveling Quantum Dephasing of Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Ensembles in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles are one of the most promising solid-state quantum platforms for various sensing applications. The combination of a long spin dephasing time ($T_2^*$) and a high NV center concentration is crucial for pushing the sensitivity limits. In this work, we propose a systematic measurement approach to quantify the electron spin dephasing in NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions of various sources to the dephasing time, including NV-NV interactions, strain and electric field distributions, $^{13}$C nuclear spins, and P1 electron spins. Our method is validated using a series of high-performance diamond samples, providing a comprehensive understanding of dephasing mechanisms and revealing correlations between NV concentration and different dephasing sources. Based on these insights, we further evaluate and propose strategies to improve the achievable sensitivity limits for DC magnetic field measurements.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation.</description>

      <title>Influence of bias voltage noise on the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally show that the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA), implementing a DC-powered parametric amplification scheme, can achieve gain and noise performance similar to that of Josephson parametric amplifiers. Using experimental data and simulations, we show that the ICTA has near-quantum-limited noise as long as the integral voltage bias noise divided by the superconducting flux quantum is below the amplification bandwidth. We observe a gain of 20 dB with noise below 1.7 times the quantum limit when the full width at half maximum of the integral voltage noise, expressed as frequency, is 5.6 MHz.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (\Qm{}) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase \Qm{}. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from \SI{45}{\nano\meter} to \SI{295}{\nano\meter}, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below \SI{200}{\nano\meter} thickness exhibit the highest \Qf{}-product, on the order of $10^{12}$\,Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher \Qf{}-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</description>

      <title>LPCVD Grown Si-Doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films with Promising Electron Mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigated the growth of Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films using LPCVD system, achieving high electron mobilities of 162 cm$^2$/V.s and 149 cm$^2$/V.s at carrier concentrations of $1.51 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, for homoepitaxial (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates and heteroepitaxial (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on off-axis c-sapphire substrates with 6{\deg} miscut, representing the highest mobilities reported for LPCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ materials. Carrier concentrations were precisely tuned by varying SiCl$_4$ flow rates at a growth temperature of 1000{\deg}C, resulting in concentrations ranging from $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ to $1.19 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, as confirmed by both Hall and C-V measurements. The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high-resolution XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by FESEM and AFM imaging showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentrations resulting in reduced RMS roughness. SIMS analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films. A high low-temperature peak mobility exceeding 843 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s was achieved for (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films at 80 K, highlighting the high purity and low compensation of these films. These findings emphasize the potential of LPCVD growth system for producing high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with thickness ranging between ~2.3-11.7 $\mu$m and faster growth rates (~4.7-17 $\mu$m/hr), promising transport properties, controllable doping, and scalability for developing high power vertical devices.</description>
