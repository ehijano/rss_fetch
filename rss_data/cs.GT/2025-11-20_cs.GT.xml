      <title>Computing Power Indices in Weighted Majority Games with Formal Power Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose fast pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms for computing power indices in weighted majority games. We show that we can compute the Banzhaf index for all players in $O(n+q\log (q))$ time, where $n$ is the number of players and $q$ is a given quota. Moreover, we prove that the Shapley--Shubik index for all players can be computed in $O(nq\log (q))$ time. Our algorithms are faster than existing algorithms when $q=2^{o(n)}$. Our algorithms exploit efficient computation techniques for formal power series.</description>

      <title>Coopetitive Index: a measure of cooperation and competition in coalition formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the coopetition index introduced by Aleandri and Dall'Aglio (2025) for simple games to the broader class of monotone transferable utility (TU) games and to all non-empty coalitions, including singletons. The new formulation allows us to define an absolute coopetition index with a universal range in [-1,1], facilitating meaningful comparisons across coalitions.
  We study several notable instances of the index, including the Banzhaf, Uniform Shapley, and Shapley-Owen coopetition indices, and we derive explicit formulas that connect coopetition to classical semivalues. Finally, we provide axiomatic characterizations of the Uniform Shapley and Shaple--Owen versions, showing that each is uniquely determined by linearity, symmetry over pure bargaining games, external null player neutrality, and a contraction axiom reflecting its internal distribution. These results position the coopetition index as a versatile tool for quantifying the cooperative and competitive tendencies of coalitions in TU-games.</description>

      <title>A Scenario Approach to the Robustness of Nonconvex-Nonconcave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates probabilistic robustness of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems via the scenario approach. Inspired by recent advances in scenario optimization (Garatti and Campi, 2025), we obtain robustness results for key equilibria with nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs, overcoming the dependence on the non-degeneracy assumption. Specifically, under convex strategy sets for all players, we first establish a probabilistic robustness guarantee for an epsilon-stationary point by proving the monotonicity of the stationary residual in the number of scenarios. Moreover, under nonconvex strategy sets for all players, we derive a probabilistic robustness guarantee for a global minimax point by invoking the extreme value theorem and Berge's maximum theorem. A numerical experiment on a unit commitment problem corroborates our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Towards Data Valuation via Asymmetric Data Shapley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As data emerges as a vital driver of technological and economic advancements, a key challenge is accurately quantifying its value in algorithmic decision-making. The Shapley value, a well-established concept from cooperative game theory, has been widely adopted to assess the contribution of individual data sources in supervised machine learning. However, its symmetry axiom assumes all players in the cooperative game are homogeneous, which overlooks the complex structures and dependencies present in real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we extend the traditional data Shapley framework to asymmetric data Shapley, making it flexible enough to incorporate inherent structures within the datasets for structure-aware data valuation. We also introduce an efficient $k$-nearest neighbor-based algorithm for its exact computation. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework across various machine learning tasks and data market contexts. The code is available at: https://github.com/xzheng01/Asymmetric-Data-Shapley.</description>

      <title>Fairshare Data Pricing via Data Valuation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training data is the backbone of large language models (LLMs), yet today's data markets often operate under exploitative pricing -- sourcing data from marginalized groups with little pay or recognition. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for LLM data markets, modeling the strategic interactions between buyers (LLM builders) and sellers (human annotators). We begin with theoretical and empirical analysis showing how exploitative pricing drives high-quality sellers out of the market, degrading data quality and long-term model performance. Then we introduce fairshare, a pricing mechanism grounded in data valuation that quantifies each data's contribution. It aligns incentives by sustaining seller participation and optimizing utility for both buyers and sellers. Theoretically, we show that fairshare yields mutually optimal outcomes: maximizing long-term buyer utility and seller profit while sustaining market participation. Empirically when training open-source LLMs on complex NLP tasks, including math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning, fairshare boosts seller earnings and ensures a stable supply of high-quality data, while improving buyers' performance-per-dollar and long-term welfare. Our findings offer a concrete path toward fair, transparent, and economically sustainable data markets for LLM.</description>

      <title>Online Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Augmenting the input of algorithms with predictions is an algorithm design paradigm that suggests leveraging a (possibly erroneous) prediction to improve worst-case performance guarantees when the prediction is perfect (consistency), while also providing a performance guarantee when the prediction fails (robustness). Recently, Xu and Lu [2022] and Agrawal et al. [2024] proposed to consider settings with strategic agents under this framework. In this paper, we initiate the study of budget-feasible mechanism design with predictions. These mechanisms model a procurement auction scenario in which an auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint seeks to purchase goods or services from a set of strategic agents, so as to maximize her own valuation function. We focus on the online version of the problem where the arrival order of agents is random. We design mechanisms that are truthful, budget-feasible, and achieve a significantly improved competitive ratio for both monotone and non-monotone submodular valuation functions compared to their state-of-the-art counterparts without predictions. Our results assume access to a prediction for the value of the optimal solution to the offline problem. We complement our positive results by showing that for the offline version of the problem, access to predictions is mostly ineffective in improving approximation guarantees.</description>

      <title>Achieving Pareto Optimality in Games via Single-bit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient coordination in multi-agent systems often incurs high communication overhead or slow convergence rates, making scalable welfare optimization difficult. We propose Single-Bit Coordination Dynamics for Pareto-Efficient Outcomes (SBC-PE), a decentralized learning algorithm requiring only a single-bit satisfaction signal per agent each round. Despite this extreme efficiency, SBC-PE guarantees convergence to the exact optimal solution in arbitrary finite games. We establish explicit regret bounds, showing expected regret grows only logarithmically with the horizon, i.e., O(log T). Compared with prior payoff-based or bandit-style rules, SBC-PE uniquely combines minimal signaling, general applicability, and finite-time guarantees. These results show scalable welfare optimization is achievable under minimal communication constraints.</description>

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. A number of decisions require a qualified majority, the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution based on the Shapley--Shubik index and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with approximately 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The decisiveness index decreases if the population criterion is above 68% or the states criterion is at least 17. Some quota combinations contradict the principles of double majority. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley--Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable for evaluating any proposal to reform the qualified majority voting system.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Barriers and Practical Pathways for Human-AI Alignment: An Agreement-Based Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize AI alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem called $\langle M,N,\varepsilon,\delta\rangle$-agreement, in which a set of $N$ agents (including humans) must reach approximate ($\varepsilon$) agreement across $M$ candidate objectives, with probability at least $1-\delta$. Analyzing communication complexity, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that once either $M$ or $N$ is large enough, no amount of computational power or rationality can avoid intrinsic alignment overheads. This establishes rigorous limits to alignment *itself*, not merely to particular methods, clarifying a "No-Free-Lunch" principle: encoding "all human values" is inherently intractable and must be managed through consensus-driven reduction or prioritization of objectives. Complementing this impossibility result, we construct explicit algorithms as achievability certificates for alignment under both unbounded and bounded rationality with noisy communication. Even in these best-case regimes, our bounded-agent and sampling analysis shows that with large task spaces ($D$) and finite samples, *reward hacking is globally inevitable*: rare high-loss states are systematically under-covered, implying scalable oversight must target safety-critical slices rather than uniform coverage. Together, these results identify fundamental complexity barriers -- tasks ($M$), agents ($N$), and state-space size ($D$) -- and offer principles for more scalable human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first complete formal solution to corrigibility in the off-switch game, with provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our framework consists of five *structurally separate* utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is *learned* to mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating *any* safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits provably dominate even when incentives conflict. For settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon "decidable island" where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.</description>
