      <title>Discharge dynamics in a cylindrical SDBD prototype reactor under ns-pulsed and sinusoidal AC operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a prototype reactor generating surface dielectric barrier discharges (SDBDs) in ambient air, designed for consistent operation while preventing constructive material degradation. It features detachable stainless steel electrodes and quartz dielectric to ensure precise fabrication. The grounded electrode is fully immersed into transformer oil drastically suppressing undesired parasitic discharges. The device efficiently sustains ns-pulsed and AC discharges at 10 kHz, enabling fundamental studies of their electrical characteristics (applied voltage, induced current, electric power) and spatiotemporal dynamics (morphology, propagation length and velocity). The electric power (P) consumed exhibits a dissimilar non-linear increase with the rising peak voltage (Vp) in each case: P$\approx$0.8-2.5 W for ns-pulsed (Vp=7-9 kV) and P$\approx$0.9-5.3 W (Vp=7-10 kV) for AC operation. Using ICCD imaging, distinct ionization channels are recorded in the rising part of the pulsed voltage being detached from the driven electrode; during the voltage decrease, a glow-like discharge is formed remaining anchored on the driven electrode. The rising part of the AC voltage is characterized by erratic, elongated ionization channels in a filamentary form, the voltage drop featuring a glow-like behavior. During the rising and falling parts of the AC voltage, the discharge reaches maximum propagation lengths (Lmax) of $\approx$12 mm and $\approx$7 mm, respectively, while remaining attached to the driven electrode. The corresponding maximum discharge velocities (vmax) are about 5x10 2 m/s and 3x10 2 m/s. For the ns-pulsed operation, Lmax$\approx$5 mm (vmax$\approx$5x10 5 m/s) and Lmax$\approx$3.5 mm (vmax$\approx$1.5x10 5 m/s) during the rising and falling parts of the voltage pulse, respectively. The SDBD dynamics generated with a ns-pulsed voltage is more reproducible than for the AC case allowing for the use of a 500 times smaller ICCD gate width (2 ns) and a more accurate description of the discharge's spatiotemporal development. This reactor is suitable for performing fundamental studies and understanding key SDBD features for various applications such as flow control, biomedicine and agriculture.</description>

      <title>Empirical scaling laws for self-focused laser pulses in nitrogen plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between a superintense laser pulse and a nitrogen plasma with densities exceeding $10^{19}\,$cm$^{-3}$, using particle-in-cell simulations. Such configurations have recently demonstrated the capability to produce highly charged electron beams (i.e., $&gt;10\,$nC) with $1\,$J-class lasers, a significant step toward high-average-current laser-plasma accelerators. Our study focuses on analyzing the impact of laser self-focusing on laser dynamics, leading to scaling laws that characterize beam diffraction, wakefield amplitude and plasma structures, providing important insights of this interaction regime.</description>

      <title>Electron and gas temperature-driven chemistry during microdischarges formed in water vapour bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microdischarges formed in bubbles immersed in liquids are of interest for materials synthesis and chemical conversion applications in the frame of plasma-driven electrochemistry. A key challenge associated with controlling such processes is the limited understanding of the gas-phase chemical kinetics in these microdischarges. Due to their large electron densities, and high gas temperatures, both electron and gas temperature driven chemistry are likely to be important. Here, a 0-D modelling approach, informed by experimental measurements, is used to study the chemical kinetics in these systems. A new reaction scheme is developed for microdischarges in water vapour, including reactions for both high electron density, and high gas temperature regimes. Microdischarges formed during plasma electrolytic oxidation are used as a test case, however, the key results are expected to be transferable to other plasma electrolysis systems with similar properties. Experimentally measured power densities are used as input to the 0-D model, together with estimates of temperatures and gas pressures within the gas bubble. Comparison of measured and simulated electron densities shows good agreement, given the limitations of both model and experiment. In the base case microdischarge, H$_{2}$O is found to be highly dissociated during the period of peak power density, with H and O making up the majority of the neutral gas in the bubble. The maximum ionization degree is around 0.31$\,\%$, and the electronegativity during the period of peak electron density is found to be low. Species formation and reaction pathways are analysed under variation of the neutral gas temperature from 2000$\,$K to 6000$\,$K. At all temperatures, electron, ion, and neutral reactions with high threshold energies are found to be important for the overall chemical kinetics.</description>

      <title>Extending near-axis equilibria in DESC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-axis description of optimised stellarator fields has proven to be a powerful tool both for design and understanding of this magnetic confinement concept. The description consists of an asymptotic model of the equilibrium in the distance from its centermost axis, and is thus only approximate. Any practical application therefore requires the eventual construction of a global equilibrium. This paper presents a novel way of constructing global equilibria using the \texttt{DESC} code that guarantees the correct asymptotic behaviour imposed by a given near-axis construction. The theoretical underpinnings of this construction are carefully presented, and benchmarking examples provided. This opens the door to an efficient coupling of the near-axis framework and that of global equilibria for future optimisation efforts.</description>

      <title>An Intermittent Model for the $1/f$ Spectrum in the Pristine Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical, observational study of the $1/f$ range of solar wind turbulence, where $f$ denotes frequency, using in situ data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). We compute the energy cascade rate using the third order law of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, incorporating expansion terms to account for solar wind dynamics. Our results reveal a $1/\tau$ dependence of the energy cascade rate, where $\tau$ is the temporal lag, within the $1/f$ range, in contrast to the constant cascade rate in the inertial range. To explain this behavior, we propose a new intermittent model predicting a $1/\ell$ scaling of the cascade rate, where $\ell$ represents the spatial lag. The analysis of the probability density function (PDF) of magnetic field increments confirms the intermittent nature of the parallel fluctuation component, whereas the perpendicular fluctuations are found to be quasi Gaussian. These findings provide new insights into energy transfer processes in the $1/f$ range of solar wind turbulence, with potential applications in planetary magnetosheaths.</description>

      <title>Tunable Epsilon Near Zero Metamaterial with Rotating Obround-Shaped Meta-Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new design of a microwave-range ENZ metamaterial consisting of rods with an obround cross-section is proposed. The plasma frequency of the metamaterial can be tuned by rotating the constituent meta-atoms. Tunability of the plasma frequency by 26% is demonstrated both experimentally and numerically. The observed tuning range is dramatically higher than in the one observed in natural materials at optical range.</description>

      <title>Extended locally monochromatic approximations of Strong-Field QED processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong-field QED (SFQED) probability rates in the locally monochromatic approximation (LMA) have become an indispensable tool for simulations of processes like gamma-ray emission or electron-positron pair production in laser-particle collisions. We revisit the LMA derivation and explicitly demonstrate that it is based on the separation of time scales, neglection of the long-range interference effects and subsequent averaging over the cycle scale. Doing so, we obtain unambiguously LMA rates for arbitrary polarizations of the plane wave background. Additionally, we partially restore the finite bandwidth effects that are lost in the LMA derivation. The bandwidth-restored result we refer to as the LMA$^+$ and show that it agrees with the full SFQED predictions better than the standard LMA. We use LMA$^+$ to address previously inaccessible observables and formulate a new limitation on the applicability of locally monochromatic approximations in general. We provide analytical results for the angular-integrated LMA$^+$ probability rate and the fully differential probability that account for the finite bandwidth effects.</description>

      <title>Information-Optimal Sensing and Control in High-Intensity Laser Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-intensity laser systems present unique measurement and optimization challenges due to their high complexity, low repetition rates, and shot-to-shot variations. We discuss recent developments towards a unified framework based on information theory and Bayesian inference that addresses these challenges. Starting from fundamental constraints on the physical field structure, we recently demonstrated how to capture complete spatio-temporal information about individual petawatt laser pulses. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate how Bayesian frameworks can leverage temporal correlations between consecutive pulses to improve measurement precision. We then extend these concepts to active sensing strategies that adaptively select measurements to maximize information gain, exemplified through Bayesian autocorrelation spectroscopy. Finally, we show how these information-optimal measurement principles naturally extend to Bayesian optimization. This progression represents a paradigm shift where measurement devices transition from passive data collectors to active participants in complex experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes the development of an active Thomson Parabola ion spectrometer designed to measure the energy spectra of different multi-MeV ion species generated in laser-plasmas interactions. To do so, GEANT4 optical simulations were carried out in order to design and build a spectrometer based on scintillator detectors capable of operating at rates comparable with the highest achievable at any existing or upcoming high intensity laser facilities. Details on the different configurations simulated and their characterization are discussed.</description>
