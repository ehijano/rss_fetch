      <title>Data-Driven Matrix Recovery with High-Dimensional Noise via Optimal Shrinkage of Singular Values and Wavelet Shrinkage of Singular Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven algorithm designed to recover low-rank matrices whose entries satisfy a mixed H\"older condition in the presence of high-dimensional noise with a separable covariance structure. The algorithm, coined extended optimal shrinkage and wavelet shrinkage (e$\mathcal{OWS}$), emphasizes the asymptotic structure, where the matrix size is significantly larger than the rank of the signal matrix. The denoising process begins with the adaptation of the well-known optimal shrinkage of singular values. This is followed by an iterative procedure that organizes the matrix using a coupled metric on the rows and columns, constructed by building a tree structure for both dimensions. This hierarchical organization induces a tensor Haar-Walsh basis on the matrix. An adapted wavelet shrinkage technique is applied to further denoise the reconstructed matrix, modifying the Haar-Walsh coefficients based on the analysis of the first-order perturbation of singular vectors. We provide theoretical guarantees for these estimators, demonstrating a convergence rate that highlights the efficacy of our algorithm. Simulations show successful matrix recovery, with a small mean squared error between the estimate and the ground truth, and accurate reconstruction of the singular vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Annealed almost periodic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies certain notions of entropy that can be associated to (i) a representation of a separable, unital C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and (ii) an auxiliary random sequence $(\pi_n)_{n\ge 1}$ of finite-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{A}$. This continues a previous research program into the properties of these entropy notions when each $\pi_n$ is deterministic, which uncovered a range of analogies with entropy in ergodic theory and also with non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorems.
  We associate two new notions of entropy to data as in (i) and (ii) above: `annealed' AP entropy, which is roughly a kind of first-moment average of deterministic AP entropies; and `zeroth-order' AP entropy, which controls the large deviations probabilities that certain positive definite functions appear in the representations $\pi_n$ at all.
  After developing some of this general theory, we then focus on the special case in which $\mathfrak{A}$ is the group C*-algebra of a finitely-generated free group and each $\pi_n$ is generated by choosing a tuple of $n$-by-$n$ unitary matrices independently at random from Haar measure. In that case, explicit formulas can be derived for some of our notions of entropy, and new large deviations principles in random matrix theory are obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>A modified Fermi Golden Rule at threshold for 3D magnetic Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider three-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with a simple threshold eigenvalue. We show, under certain assumptions, that when a small magnetic field is introduced, this eigenvalue turns into a resonance in the time-dependent sense. We find the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the imaginary part of the resonance and discuss the principal differences with respect to resonances induced by weak electric fields obtained previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via nodal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For given $\Delta&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\lambda&lt;3/\sqrt{2}$, we show that the maximum multiplicity that $\lambda$ can appear as the second largest eigenvalue of a connected graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is $O_{\Delta,\lambda}(1)$. This result answers a question due to Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang and Zhao [Question 6.4, Ann. of Math. (2) 194 (2021), no. 3, 729-743] in the case of $0&lt;\lambda&lt;3/\sqrt{2}$, and consequently leads to improvements in their results on equiangular lines. Our proof is based on the concept of nodal domains of eigenfunctions. Indeed, we establish a multiplicity estimate in terms of maximum degree and cyclomatic number of the graph, via a novel construction of eigenfunctions with large number of nodal domains.</description>

      <title>An Alon-Boppana--type bound for very dense graphs, with applications to max-cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we show that if $G$ is a regular graph on $n \gg_\epsilon 1$ vertices that is $\epsilon$-far (differs by at least $\epsilon n^2$ edges) from any Tur\'{a}n graph, then its second eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ satisfies $$\lambda_2 \geq n^{1/4 - \epsilon}.$$ The exponent $1/4$ is optimal. Our result generalizes an analogous bound, independently obtained by Balla, R\"{a}ty -- Sudakov-Tomon, and Ihringer, which only applies to graphs with density at most $\frac{1}{2}$. Up to a lower-order factor, this confirms a conjecture of R\"{a}ty, Sudakov and Tomon. Our spectral approach has interesting applications to max-cut. First, we show that if a graph $G$, on $n \gg_\epsilon 1$ vertices and $m$ edges, is $\epsilon$-far from a disjoint union of cliques, then it has a max-cut of size at least $$\frac{m}{2} + n^{1.01}.$$ Our result improves upon a classical result of Edwards by a non-trivial polynomial factor, making progress towards another conjecture of R\"{a}ty, Sudakov and Tomon. As another application of our method, we show that if a graph $G$ is $H$-free and has $m$ edges, then $G$ has a max-cut of size at least $$\frac{m}{2} + c_H m^{0.5001}$$ where $c_H &gt; 0$ is some constant depending on $H$ only. This result makes progress towards a conjecture of Alon, Bollob\'{a}s, Krivelevich and Sudakov, and answers recent questions by Glock-Janzer-Sudakov and Balla-Janzer-Sudakov.</description>

      <title>Maximizing higher eigenvalues in dimensions three and above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing the $k$-th eigenvalue functional over the class of absolutely continuous measures on a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m\geq 3$.
  For dimensions $3 \leq m \leq 6$, we generalize the work of Karpukhin and Stern on the first eigenvalue, showing that the maximizing measures are realized by smooth harmonic maps into finite-dimensional spheres.
  For $m \geq 7$, the maximizing measures are again induced by harmonic maps, which may now exhibit singularities. We prove that $m-7$ is the optimal upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set. More precisely, for any $m \geq 7$, there exist maximizing harmonic maps on the $m$-dimensional sphere whose singular sets have any prescribed integer dimension up to $m - 7$.</description>

      <title>The Bowen$\unicode{x2013}$Series coding and zeros of zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a discussion of the classical Bowen$\unicode{x2013}$Series coding and, in particular, its application to the study of zeta functions associated to geodesic flows and their zeros. In the case of compact surfaces of constant negative curvature $-1$ the analytic extension of the Selberg zeta function to the entire complex plane is classical, and can be achieved using the Selberg trace formula. However, an alternative dynamical approach is to use the Bowen$\unicode{x2013}$Series coding on the boundary at infinity to obtain a piecewise analytic expanding map from which the extension of the zeta function can be obtained using properties of the associated transfer operator. This latter method has the advantage that it also applies in the case of infinite area surfaces provided they do not have cusps. For such examples the location of the zeros is somewhat more mysterious. However, in particularly simple examples there is a striking structure to the zeros when we take appropriate limits. We will try to give some insight into this phenomenon.
  The newer version, in addition to the study of pair of pants, also includes heuristic analysis of the zeta function associated to the geodesic flow on symmetric one-funneled tori; in particular, there is a number of pure numerical results on location of its small zeros.</description>

      <title>On asymptotics of Robin eigenvalues in the Dirichlet limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian with homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, when the (positive) Robin parameter is diverging. In this framework, since the convergence of the Robin eigenvalues to the Dirichlet ones is known, we address the question of quantifying the rate of such convergence. More precisely, in this work we identify the proper geometric quantity representing (asymptotically) the first term in the expansion of the eigenvalue variation: it is a novel notion of torsional rigidity. Then, by performing a suitable asymptotic analysis of both such quantity and its minimizer, we prove the first-order expansion of any Robin eigenvalue, in the Dirichlet limit. Moreover, the convergence rate of the corresponding eigenfunctions is obtained as well. We remark that all our spectral estimates are explicit and sharp, and cover both the cases of convergence to simple and multiple Dirichlet eigenvalues.</description>
