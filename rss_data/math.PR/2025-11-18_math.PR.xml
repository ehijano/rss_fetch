      <title>Estimating the critical threshold for stretched-out hyperbolic random connection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the model-dependent asymptotic behaviour of the critical threshold intensity for stretched-out random connection models (RCMs) on hyperbolic spaces. The proof uses lace expansion arguments, but has notable qualitative differences to the Euclidean case in how it evaluates spectral radii. The result is applied to the Boolean disc RCM and a heat kernel RCM.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for stochastic Volterra equations with small noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general class of stochastic Volterra equations with small noise. Our aim is to study the fluctuation of the solution around its deterministic limit. We use the techniques of Malliavin calculus to show that the fluctuation process satisfies central limit theorem and provide an optimal estimate for the rate of convergence. An application to stochastic Volterra equations with fractional Brownian motion kernel is given to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wright Analysis: Stochastic and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic counterpart of the generalized Wright analysis introduced in Beghin et al.~ in Integral Equations and Operator Theory, {\bf 97}, 2025. We define a new class of non-Gaussian and non-Markovian processes, called the generalized Fox-$H$ process, which extends well-known processes such as fractional Brownian motion and generalized grey Brownian motion. We study their joint probability density and covariance, showing the stationarity of their increments. In addition, this process has H{\"o}lder continuous paths and is represented as a time-change of fractional Brownian motion. We characterize the generalized Fox-$H$ noise as an element in the distribution space $(\mathcal{S})^{-1}_{\mu_\Psi}$. We conclude by establishing the existence of local times and discussing their anomalous diffusion properties.</description>

      <title>Some continuity estimates for ruin probability and other ruin-related quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate continuity properties for ruin probability in the classical risk model. Properties of contractive integral operators are used to derive continuity estimates for the deficit at ruin. These results are also applied to obtain desired continuity inequalities in the setting of continuous time surplus process perturbed by diffusion. In this framework, the ruin probability can be expressed as the convolution of a compound geometric distribution $K$ with a diffusion term. A continuity inequality for $K$ is derived and an iterative approximation for this ruin-related quantity is proposed. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On the distribution patterns of zeros for random polynomials with regularly varying coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates asymptotic distribution of complex zeros of random polynomials $P_n(z):=\sum_{k=0}^{n}b(k)\xi_k z^k$, as $n\to\infty$, where $b$ is a regularly varying function at infinity with index $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$ and $(\xi_k)_{k\geq 0}$ is a sequence of independent copies of a complex-valued random variable $\xi$. The limiting distribution of zeros both inside and outside the unit disk is determined assuming $\mathbb{E}[\log^{+}|\xi|]&lt;\infty$. Under the additional assumptions $\mathbb{E}[\xi]=0$ and $\mathbb{E}[|\xi|^2]&lt;\infty$, local universality results for zeros near the boundary of the unit disk are established. Notably, it is shown that the point process of zeros undergoes a transition from liquid-like to crystalline phases as $\alpha$ crosses the critical value $\alpha_c = -1/2$ from right to left. In the liquid phase ($\alpha &gt; \alpha_c$), the limiting point process of zeros is universal. In the crystalline phase, it is universal if and only if $\alpha = \alpha_c$ and $\sum_k b^2(k) = +\infty$ (the weak crystalline phase), and non-universal when $\sum_k b^2(k) &lt; +\infty$ (the strong crystalline phase). The zeros of the so-called random self-inversive polynomials on the unit circle exhibit a similar phase transition.</description>

      <title>Thresholds and Fluctuations of Submultiplexes in Random Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multiplex network a common set of nodes is connected through different types of interactions, each represented as a separate graph (layer) within the network. In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of submultiplexes, the counterparts of subgraphs (motifs) in single-layer networks, in the correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi multiplex model. This is a random multiplex model with two layers, where the graphs in each layer marginally follow the classical (single-layer) Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model, while the edges across layers are correlated. We derive the precise threshold condition for the emergence of a fixed submultiplex $\boldsymbol{H}$ in a random multiplex sampled from the correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model. Specifically, we show that the satisfiability region, the regime where the random multiplex contains infinitely many copies of $\boldsymbol{H}$, forms a polyhedral subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Furthermore, within this region the count of $\boldsymbol{H}$ is asymptotically normal, with an explicit convergence rate in the Wasserstein distance. We also establish various Poisson approximation results for the count of $\boldsymbol{H}$ on the boundary of the threshold, which depends on a notion of balance of submultiplexes. Collectively, these results provide an asymptotic theory for small submultiplexes in the correlated multiplex model, analogous to the classical theory of small subgraphs in random graphs.</description>

      <title>Spatial SIR epidemic model with varying infectivity in an unbounded domain: Law of Large Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spatial SIR epidemic model where the infectivity of infected individuals depends upon their age of infection, and infections are non local. The domain is an unbounded subset of $\R^d$,and the individuals do not move. We extend our earlier result in \cite{AK-EP}, where the domain was bounded, and prove a law of large numbers as the size of the population tends to $\infty$.</description>

      <title>The Eigenvector Bead Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the overlap matrix between the eigenvectors of a Wigner matrix $H_{N+K}$ of size $(N+K)\times(N+K)$ and those of its principal minor $H_N$ of size $N\times N$, for both the real symmetric ($\beta=1$) and complex Hermitian ($\beta=2$) ensembles, in the regime where $N \to \infty$ while $K$ remains fixed.
  Our analysis yields two main results. (i) In the \emph{bulk} of the spectrum, an eigenvector of $H_{N+K}$ associated with an eigenvalue at energy level $E$ projects primarily onto eigenvectors of $H_N$ located at the same local spectral level. This phenomenon, which we call \emph{local projection}, highlights a robust stability of the eigenbasis under matrix growth. (ii) At the \emph{spectral edge}, the change of basis between the leading eigenspaces of consecutive minors is asymptotically governed by a random antisymmetric perturbation of order $N^{-1/3}$. In both cases, we provide the asymptotic law of the overlaps expressed in terms of the Airy and Sine kernels.
  We further extend our analysis to the case of Wishart matrices, that is, sample covariance matrices of the form $W = X^{\!\top} X$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}$ is a matrix with i.i.d.\ random entries. We establish analogous results for the overlaps between eigenvectors of consecutive minors of $W$, both in the bulk and at the spectral edges (soft and hard). The limiting laws share the same universal structure as in the Wigner case, up to explicit constants depending on the aspect ratio $q = N/T$. This demonstrates the universality of the eigenvector overlap process across distinct random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>The Ginibre Ensemble Conditioned on an Overcrowding Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre Ensemble of random matrices consisting of $N$ eigenvalues. We study the event that for $ {c \in [0,1]}$, $\lfloor cN \rfloor$ of the eigenvalues are located outside of a disk of radius $ R \in (\sqrt{1-c},1)$. Except for the case $c=1$ the eigenvalue process conditioned on this event is not determinantal. Nevertheless we are able to obtain asymptotic estimates of the probability of the event, and describe the conditional distribution in three spatial regions. For $ \{ \lambda \in \mathbb{C} : \big| \lambda \big| &lt;R\}, \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : \big| \lambda \big| &gt; R+\epsilon\} $ the conditional distribution is asymptotically that of a Ginibre ensemble. Meanwhile, near the boundary of the disk, after rescaling by a factor of order $ N$, it tends to the determinantal point process that appears in the limit of the Ginibre ensemble near a hard wall in Seo arXiv:2010.08818 [math-ph] .</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any indeterminate Hamburger moment problem there exists an infinite family of analytic densities with finite (Shannon) entropy. This shows that the maximal entropy density g_{hmax} among the densities to the moment problem has finite entropy. The result is illustrated by the Al-Salam--Carlitz moment problem.</description>

      <title>A stochastic flow approach to De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates for SPDEs with smooth transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory ensures that solutions to uniformly elliptic or parabolic PDEs are bounded and H\"older continuous, even with merely bounded measurable coefficients. For parabolic SPDEs with transport noise, boundedness has recently been established, but H\"older continuity remains a key open problem in the regularity theory of parabolic SPDEs. In this work, we resolve this question under the assumption that the noise coefficients are sufficiently regular in space. Our approach relies on Kunita's stochastic method of characteristics, which allows us to transform the original SPDE-via a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms-into a random PDE to which the classical De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates apply. This program is accomplished through new a-priori estimates for the inverse of stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms, and a novel version of the It\^o-Wentzell formula adapted to rough random fields. To demonstrate the applicability of our results, we establish the existence of global, regular solutions to quasilinear SPDEs with transport noise.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a convergence notion for ordered selections. Our convergence notion is based on subpermutation densities and convergences of the marginal distributions. A particular case of this convergence is the well-known convergence of permutation sequences. We also introduce a family of probability measures called generalized permutons. We show that in the family of generalized permutons several convergence notions are equivalent. We embed the set of ordered selections to the set of generalized permutons. We prove that any convergent sequence of ordered selections has a limit which is a generalized permuton. Moreover, any generalized permuton is the limit of a sequence of ordered selections. Our results are generalizations of well-known theorems on convergence of permutation sequences to permutons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of stochastic microorganism flocculation models. Given the strong influence of environmental and seasonal fluctuations that are present in these models, we propose a stochastic model that includes multiple layers of stochasticity, from small Brownian fluctuations, to possibly large changes due to environmental `shifts'. We are able to give a full classification of the asymptotic behavior of these models. New techniques had to be developed to prove the persistence and extinction of the process as the system is not in Kolmogorov form and, as a result, the analysis is significantly more involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the sharp threshold for universality of cokernels of random matrices over finite fields. More precisely, we prove the following: given any constant $c&gt;1$, let $A(n)$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_p$ whose entries are independent and take any given value of $\mathbb{F}_p$ with probability at most $1 - \frac{c \log n}{n}$. Then the cokernels of $A(n)$ converge in distribution, as $n \to \infty$, to the same limiting law as the cokernels of uniform random $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$. This answers an open problem posed by Wood (2022).</description>

Abstract: This article establishes several necessary and sufficient criteria on asymptotic stability and mean ergodicity in various types of topologies for Feller processes taking values in Polish spaces. In particular, asymptotic stability and mean ergodicity in Wasserstein distance and weighted total variation distance are considered. The characterizations are formulated by using the notions of generalized eventual continuity properties and lower bound conditions, where the proofs invoke the coupling approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive precise estimates for the probability that a Bessel bridge of dimension $d \ge 0$ and end points $x$ and $a+bT-j$ stays below the linear barrier $a + bt$ for all $t \in [0,T]$. We identify the leading order term as well as the asymptotic error for this probability as $T\to \infty$, depending on $a,b,j,x$. We also derive the behaviour of such leading term as we allow $a,j\to \infty$, and obtain precise bounds for all error terms. Finally, we establish a complementary result where the linear barrier is perturbed by a small concave function.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Hawkes Processes using their Affine Volterra Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel and efficient simulation scheme for Hawkes processes on a fixed time grid, leveraging their affine Volterra structure. The key idea is to first simulate the integrated intensity and the counting process using Inverse Gaussian and Poisson distributions, from which the jump times can then be easily recovered. Unlike conventional exact algorithms based on sampling jump times first, which have random computational complexity and can be prohibitive in the presence of high activity or singular kernels, our scheme has deterministic complexity which enables efficient large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and facilitates vectorization. Our method applies to any nonnegative, locally integrable kernel, including singular and non-monotone ones. By reformulating the scheme as a stochastic Volterra equation with a measure-valued kernel, we establish weak convergence to the target Hawkes process in the Skorokhod $J_1$-topology. Numerical experiments confirm substantial computational gains while preserving high accuracy across a wide range of kernels, with remarkably improved performance for a variant of our scheme based on the resolvent of the kernel.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of rare events in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding rare events is critical across domains ranging from signal processing to reliability and structural safety, extreme-weather forecasting, and insurance. The analysis of rare events is a computationally challenging problem, particularly in high dimensions $d$. In this work, we develop the first asymptotic high-dimensional theory of rare events. First, we exploit asymptotic integral methods recently developed by the first author to provide an asymptotic expansion of rare event probabilities. The expansion employs the geometry of the rare event boundary and the local behavior of the log probability density. Generically, the expansion is valid if $d^2\ll\lambda$, where $\lambda$ characterizes the extremity of the event. We prove this condition is necessary by constructing an example in which the first-order remainder is bounded above and below by $d^2/\lambda$. We also provide a nonasymptotic remainder bound which specifies the precise dependence of the remainder on $d$, $\lambda$, the density, and the boundary, and which shows that in certain cases, the condition $d^2\ll \lambda$ can be relaxed. As an application of the theory, we derive asymptotic approximations to rare probabilities under the standard Gaussian density in high dimensions. In the second part of our work, we provide an asymptotic approximation to densities conditional on rare events. This gives rise to simple procedure for approximately sampling conditionally on the rare event using independent Gaussian and exponential random variables.</description>

      <title>Coclique level structure for stochastic chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous time Markov chains are commonly used as models for the stochastic behavior of chemical reaction networks. More precisely, these Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks (SCRNs) are frequently used to gain a mechanistic understanding of how chemical reaction rate parameters impact the stochastic behavior of these systems. One property of interest is mean first passage times (MFPTs) between states. However, deriving explicit formulas for MFPTs can be highly complex. In order to address this problem, we first introduce the concept of coclique level structure and develop theorems to determine whether certain SCRNs have this feature by studying associated graphs. Additionally, we develop an algorithm to identify, under specific assumptions, all possible coclique level structures associated with a given SCRN. Finally, we demonstrate how the presence of such a structure in a SCRN allows us to derive closed form formulas for both upper and lower bounds for the MFPTs. Our methods can be applied to SCRNs taking values in a generic finite state space and can also be applied to models with non-mass-action kinetics. We illustrate our results with examples from the biological areas of epigenetics, neurobiology and ecology.</description>

      <title>Simulating Keystroke and Computing the Theoretical Probability of Infinite Monkey Theorem with Markov Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Infinite Monkey Theorem states that if one monkey randomly hits the keys in front of a typewriter keyboard during an infinite amount of time, any works written by William Shakespeare will almost surely be typed out at the end of the total text. Due to the seemingly low chance of typing the exact literature works, our group are motivated to find out the expected time the Hamlet, our target text, being typed out by simulated random typing on a standard keyboard. For finding the answer, 30 users randomly typed characters into a file. Then, the frequency of each characters occurred following the previous character is calculated. This conditional probability is used to build the Markov matrix by considering all 128 times 128 cases. Finally, the expected time we estimated is about 10 to the power of 34 (min), which is surprisingly lower than the theoretical computation, and not achievable at all even in the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian computation for stochastic hybrid systems with ergodic behaviour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise diffusion Markov processes (PDifMPs) form a versatile class of stochastic hybrid systems that combine continuous diffusion processes with discrete event-driven dynamics, enabling flexible modelling of complex real-world hybrid phenomena. The practical utility of PDifMP models, however, depends critically on accurate estimation of their underlying parameters. In this work, we present a novel framework for parameter inference in PDifMPs based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide detailed simulation algorithms for PDifMP sample paths. Second, we extend existing ABC summary statistics for diffusion processes to account for the hybrid nature of PDifMPs, showing particular effectiveness for ergodic systems. Third, we demonstrate our approach on several representative example PDifMPs that empirically exhibit ergodic behaviour. Our results show that the proposed ABC method reliably recovers model parameters across all examples, even in challenging scenarios where only partial information on jumps and diffusion is available or when parameters appear in state-dependent jump rate functions. These findings highlight the potential of ABC as a practical tool for inference in various complex stochastic hybrid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11956v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Langevin diffusion process $\mathrm{d} X_t = \nabla \log p_t(X_t) + \sqrt{2}\mathrm{d} W_t$ guided by the time-dependent probability density $p_t(x)$. Let $q_t$ be the density of $X_t$. Recently, in order to analyze convergence in the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the time derivative of $t\mapsto \mathrm{KL}(q_t|p_t)$ has been used in several works without investigating in detail when such a derivative exists. In this short manuscript we provide a rigorous derivation of the quantity $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\mathrm{KL}(q_t|p_t)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a discrete-time model of a financial market where a risky asset is bought and sold with transactions having a transient price impact. It is shown that the corresponding utility maximization problem admits a solution. We manage to remove some unnatural restrictions on the market depth and resilience processes that were present in earlier work. A non-standard feature of the problem is that the set of attainable portfolio values may fail the convexity property.</description>

      <title>The Probabilistic Foundations of Surveillance Failure: From False Alerts to Structural Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades, forensic statisticians have debated whether searching large DNA databases undermines the evidential value of a match. Modern surveillance faces an exponentially harder problem: screening populations across thousands of attributes using threshold rules rather than exact matching. Intuition suggests that requiring many coincidental matches should make false alerts astronomically unlikely. This intuition fails.
  Consider a system that monitors 1,000 attributes, each with a 0.5 percent innocent match rate. Matching 15 pre-specified attributes has probability \(10^{-35}\), one in 30 decillion, effectively impossible. But operational systems require no such specificity. They might flag anyone who matches \emph{any} 15 of the 1,000. In a city of one million innocent people, this produces about 226 false alerts. A seemingly impossible event becomes all but guaranteed. This is not an implementation flaw but a mathematical consequence of high-dimensional screening.
  We identify fundamental probabilistic limits on screening reliability. Systems undergo sharp transitions from reliable to unreliable with small increases in data scale, a fragility worsened by data growth and correlations. As data accumulate and correlation collapses effective dimensionality, systems enter regimes where alerts lose evidential value even when individual coincidences remain vanishingly rare. This framework reframes the DNA database controversy as a shift between operational regimes. Unequal surveillance exposures magnify failure, making ``structural bias'' mathematically inevitable. These limits are structural: beyond a critical scale, failure cannot be prevented through threshold adjustment or algorithmic refinement.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the time to consensus in Nakamoto blockchains. Specifically, we consider two competing growth processes, labeled \emph{honest} and \emph{adversarial}, and determine the time after which the honest process permananetly exceeds the adversarial process. This is done via queueing techniques. The predominant difficulty is that the honest growth process is subject to \emph{random delays}. In a stylized Bitcoin model, we compute the Laplace transform for the time to consensus and verify it via simulation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Harnack estimates for weak solutions to the following nonlocal equation: $$ \partial_t u = \Delta^{\alpha/2} u + b \cdot \nabla u + f, $$ where $\Delta^{\alpha/2}$ denotes the fractional Laplacian, $b$ is a divergence-free vector field in a critical or supercritical regularity regime, and $f$ is a distribution in a fractional Sobolev space with negative indices. As applications of the analytical results obtained in this paper, we establish the well-posedness of critical stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations driven by additive Brownian noise, prove the existence of weak solutions to the two-dimensional fractional Navier--Stokes equations with measure-valued initial vorticity, and demonstrate the well-posedness of generalized martingale problems associated with critical stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Manifold Distances from Noisy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing the intrinsic geometry of a manifold from noisy pairwise distance observations. Specifically, let $M$ denote a diameter 1 d-dimensional manifold and $\mu$ a probability measure on $M$ that is mutually absolutely continuous with the volume measure. Suppose $X_1,\dots,X_N$ are i.i.d. samples of $\mu$ and we observe noisy-distance random variables $d'(X_j, X_k)$ that are related to the true geodesic distances $d(X_j,X_k)$. With mild assumptions on the distributions and independence of the noisy distances, we develop a new framework for recovering all distances between points in a sufficiently dense subsample of $M$. Our framework improves on previous work which assumed i.i.d. additive noise with known moments. Our method is based on a new way to estimate $L_2$-norms of certain expectation-functions $f_x(y)=\mathbb{E}d'(x,y)$ and use them to build robust clusters centered at points of our sample. Using a new geometric argument, we establish that, under mild geometric assumptions--bounded curvature and positive injectivity radius--these clusters allow one to recover the true distances between points in the sample up to an additive error of $O(\varepsilon \log \varepsilon^{-1})$. We develop two distinct algorithms for producing these clusters. The first achieves a sample complexity $N \asymp \varepsilon^{-2d-2}\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and runtime $o(N^3)$. The second introduces novel geometric ideas that warrant further investigation. In the presence of missing observations, we show that a quantitative lower bound on sampling probabilities suffices to modify the cluster construction in the first algorithm and extend all recovery guarantees. Our main technical result also elucidates which properties of a manifold are necessary for the distance recovery, which suggests further extension of our techniques to a broader class of metric probability spaces.</description>

      <title>An Online Multiobjective Policy Gradient for Long-run Average-reward Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for multi-objective decision-making, where the agent seeks to optimize a vector of rewards rather than a single scalar value. The objective is to ensure that the time-averaged reward vector converges asymptotically to a predefined target set. Since standard RL algorithms operate on scalar rewards, we introduce a dynamic scalarization mechanism guided by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence. We establish theoretical convergence of the long-run average reward vector to the target set and validate the approach through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Analysis of Poisson randomized midpoint Langevin Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of sampling from a high-dimensional distribution $\pi$ on $\R^d$ is a fundamental algorithmic problem with applications throughout statistics, engineering, and the sciences. Consider the Langevin diffusion on $\R^d$ \begin{align*} \dif X_t=-\nabla U(X_t)dt+\sqrt{2}dB_t, \end{align*} under mild conditions, it admits $\pi(\dif x)\propto \exp(-U(x))\dif x$ as its unique stationary distribution. Recently, Kandasamy and Nagaraj (2024) introduced a stochastic algorithm called Poisson Randomized Midpoint Langevin Monte Carlo (PRLMC) to enhance the rate of convergence towards the target distribution $\pi$. In this paper, we first show that under mild conditions, the PRLMC, as a Markov chain, admits a unique stationary distribution $\pi_\eta$ ($\eta$ is the step size) and obtain the convergence rate of PRLMC to $\pi_\eta$ in total variation distance. Then we establish a sharp error bound between $\pi_\eta$ and $\pi$ under the 2-Wasserstein distance. Finally, we propose a decreasing-step size version of PRLMC and provide its convergence rate to $\pi$ which is nearly optimal.</description>

Abstract: The randomized midpoint Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC), introduced by Shen and Lee (2019), is a variant of classical Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm. It was shown in the literature that the RLMC is an efficient algorithm for approximating high-dimensional probability distribution $\pi$. In this paper, we establish the exponential ergodicity of RLMC with constant step-size. Moreover, we design a dereasing-step size RLMC and provide its convergence rate in terms of a functional class distance.</description>

      <title>Revealing POMDPs: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis for Parity Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME.</description>

Abstract: We study the Mosco-convergence of Cheeger energies on Gromov-Hausdorff converging spaces satisfying different types of curvature dimension conditions. The case of functions of bounded variation is also considered. Our method, covering possibly infinite dimensional settings, is based on a Lagrangian approach and combines the stability properties of Wasserstein geodesics with the characterization of the nonsmooth calculus in duality with test plans.</description>

      <title>A sharp commutator estimate for all Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a functional inequality in any dimension controlling the derivative along a transport of the Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the third author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where this control is an essential ingredient. Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp. In this paper, we obtain the optimal $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$ error, for all cases, including the sub-Coulomb case. Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.
  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium. In particular, we show here for $\mathsf{s}&lt;\mathsf{d}-2$ the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows. This complements the recent work arXiv:2407.15650 on the optimal rate for the (super-)Coulomb case $\mathsf{d}-2\le \mathsf{s}&lt;\mathsf{d}$ and therefore resolves the entire potential Riesz case.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of random walks on simple homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is a non-compact simple Lie group and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that the random walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure unless it is trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that the starting point may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  The main challenge is to show that the dimensional properties of a given probability distribution on $G/\Lambda$ improve under convolution by $\mu$. For this, we develop a new method, which combines a dimensional stability result and a dimensional increase alternative. This approach allows us to bypass inherent geometric obstructions. To show dimensional stability, we establish a general subcritical projection theorem under optimal non-concentration assumptions on the projector, and a corresponding submodular inequality in simple Lie algebras which allows its application to random walks. Both are of independent interest. The dimensional increase alternative aligns with the spirit of Bourgain's projection theorem. It is fine-tuned for random walks and has the advantage of being valid in situations lacking transversality.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: Branching processes in a varying environment encompass a wide range of stochastic demographic models, and their complete understanding in terms of limit behaviour poses a formidable research challenge. In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of such processes within a continuous-time framework, assuming that the reproduction law of individuals adheres to a specific parametric form for the probability generating function. Our six clear-cut limit theorems support the notion of recognizing five distinct asymptotical regimes for branching in varying environments: supercritical, asymptotically degenerate, critical, strictly subcritical, and loosely subcritical.</description>

Abstract: We consider any fixed $d\in\mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$ number of second class particles in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), constructed via a basic coupling of two ASEPs. We give the joint distribution of the positions of the second class particles and also the probability of there being a second class particle at a given site, under the natural blocking measure for ASEP. In order to find these distributions we use results about the number of particles in half-infinite and finite site ranges of ASEP. Our investigations also lead to probabilistic proofs of well-known combinatorial identities; the Durfee rectangles identity, Euler's identity, and the $q$-Binomial Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an interacting particle system which models the inherited sterility method. Individuals evolve on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ according to a contact process with parameter $\lambda&gt;0$. With probability $p \in [0,1]$ an offspring is fertile and can give birth to other individuals at rate $\lambda$. With probability $1-p$, an offspring is sterile and blocks the site it sits on until it dies. The goal is to prove that at fixed $\lambda$, the system survives for large enough $p$ and dies out for small enough $p$. The model is not attractive, since an increase of fertile individuals potentially causes that of sterile ones. However, thanks to a comparison argument with attractive models, we are able to answer our question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the commutation relation for 2-radial SLE in the unit disc starting from two boundary points. We follow the framework introduced by Dub\'{e}dat. Under an additional requirement of the interchangeability of the two curves, we classify all locally commuting 2-radial SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (0,8)$: it is either a two-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with spiral of constant spiraling rate or a chordal SLE$_\kappa$ weighted by a power of the conformal radius of its complement. Namely, for fixed $\kappa$ and starting points, we have exactly two one-parameter continuous families of locally commuting 2-radial SLE. Two-sided radial SLE with spiral is a generalization of two-sided radial SLE (without spiral) and satisfies the resampling property. We also discuss the semiclassical limit of the commutation relation as $\kappa \to 0$. In particular, we show that the limit for the second family with an appropriately chosen power of conformal radius is a chord that minimizes a modified chordal Loewner energy, which is unique only when the endpoints are not antipodal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the degree index and clustering index in random graphs. The degree index in our setup is a certain measure of degree irregularity whose basic properties are well studied in the literature, and the corresponding theoretical analysis in a random graph setup turns out to be tractable. On the other hand, the clustering index, based on a similar reasoning, is first introduced in this manuscript. Computing exact expressions for the expected clustering index turns out to be more challenging even in the case of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and our results are on obtaining relevant upper bounds. These are also complemented with observations based on Monte Carlo simulations. Besides the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi case, we also do simulation-based analysis for random regular graphs, the Barab\'asi-Albert model and the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that the random degree constrained process (a time-evolving random graph model with degree constraints) has a local weak limit, provided that the underlying host graphs are high degree almost regular. We, moreover, identify the limit object as a multi-type branching process, by combining coupling arguments with the analysis of a certain recursive tree process. Using a spectral characterization, we also give an asymptotic expansion of the critical time when the giant component emerges in the so-called random $d$-process, resolving a problem of Warnke and Wormald for large $d$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we use a new approach to study the spread of an infectious disease. Indeed, we study a SIR epidemic model with variable infectivity, where the individuals are distributed over a compact subset $D$ of $\R^d$. We define empirical measures which describe the evolution of the state (susceptible, infectious, recovered) of the individuals in the various locations, and the total force of infection in the population. In our model, the individuals do not move. We establish a law of large numbers for these measures, as the population size tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: We study the strong approximation of the solutions to singular stochastic kinetic equations (also referred to as second-order SDEs) driven by $\alpha$-stable processes, using an Euler-type scheme inspired by [11]. For these equations, the stability index $\alpha$ lies in the range $(1,2)$, and the drift term exhibits anisotropic $\beta$-H\"older continuity with $\beta &gt;1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}$. We establish a convergence rate of $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha(1+\alpha)} \wedge \frac{1}{2})$, which aligns with the results in [4] concerning first-order SDEs.</description>

      <title>All spatial random graphs with weak long-range effects have chemical distance comparable to Euclidean distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note provides a sufficient condition for linear lower bounds on chemical distances (compared to the Euclidean distance) in general spatial random graphs. The condition is based on the scarceness of long edges in the graph and weak correlations at large distances and is valid for all translation invariant and locally finite graphs that fulfil these conditions. The proof is based on a renormalisation scheme introduced by Berger [arXiv: 0409021 (2004)].</description>

      <title>Optimal Low degree hardness for Broadcasting on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broadcasting on trees is a fundamental model from statistical physics that plays an important role in information theory, noisy computation and phylogenetic reconstruction within computational biology and linguistics. While this model permits efficient linear-time algorithms for the inference of the root from the leaves, recent work suggests that non-trivial computational complexity may be required for inference.
  The inference of the root state can be performed using the celebrated Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which achieves Bayes-optimal performance. Although BP runs in linear time using real arithmetic operations, recent research indicates that it requires non-trivial computational complexity using more refined complexity measures.
  Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon demonstrated such complexity by constructing a Markov chain for which estimating the root better than random guessing (for typical inputs) is $NC^1$-complete. Kohler and Mossel constructed chains where, for trees with $N$ leaves, achieving better-than-random root recovery requires polynomials of degree $N^{\Omega(1)}$. The papers above raised the question of whether such complexity bounds hold generally below the celebrated Kesten-Stigum bound.
  In a recent work, Huang and Mossel established a general degree lower bound of $\Omega(\log N)$ below the Kesten-Stigum bound. Specifically, they proved that any function expressed as a linear combination of functions of at most $O(log N)$ leaves has vanishing correlation with the root. In this work, we get an exponential improvement of this lower bound by establishing an $N^{\Omega(1)}$ degree lower bound, for any broadcast process in the whole regime below the Kesten-Stigum bound.</description>

      <title>Current expansion and couplings for Ising lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss a random current expansion and a switching lemma for Ising lattice gauge theory at all choices of inverse temperature $\beta$, leading to summation over surfaces. We also describe couplings of this expansion with other representations, including the high-temperature expansion and the cluster expansion. We deduce some simple consequences, including several expressions for the Wilson loop expectation (at any $\beta$), a new proof of the area law estimate for sufficiently small \( \beta\), and a proof of exponential decay of correlations for small and large \( \beta. \) We also derive a few results analogous to corresponding results for the Ising model. In particular, we show that the Wilson loop expectation is non-negative at any $\beta$ and give an alternative short proof of Griffith's second inequality and, as a consequence, show that the Wilson loop expectations are increasing in \( \beta\) for all $\beta$.</description>

      <title>On the contraction properties of Sinkhorn semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel semigroup stability analysis based on Lyapunov techniques and contraction coefficients to prove exponential convergence of Sinkhorn equations on weighted Banach spaces. This operator-theoretic framework yields exponential decays of Sinkhorn iterates towards Schr\"odinger bridges with respect to general classes of $\phi$-divergences and Kantorovich-type criteria, including the relative entropy, squared Hellinger integrals, $\alpha$-divergences as well as weighted total variation norms and Wasserstein distances. To the best of our knowledge, these contraction inequalities are the first results of this type in the literature on entropic transport and the Sinkhorn algorithm.
  We also provide Lyapunov contractions principles under minimal regularity conditions that allow to provide quantitative exponential stability estimates for a large class of Sinkhorn semigroups. We apply this novel framework in a variety of situations, ranging from polynomial growth potentials and heavy tailed marginals on general normed spaces to more sophisticated boundary state space models, including semi-circle transitions, Beta, Weibull, exponential marginals as well as semi-compact models. Last but not least, our approach also allows to consider statistical finite mixture of the above models, including kernel-type density estimators of complex data distributions arising in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Limits for Measure-Valued Queueing Models Without State Space Collapse, With Application to General Random Order of Service Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, there is no general theory for deriving diffusion approximations of queueing systems with high- or infinite-dimensional state descriptors. In this paper, we address this by developing a novel framework for deriving diffusion limit equations of queueing models. The method hinges on a martingale decomposition of dynamics driven by time-changed renewal processes, which are a common feature of many queueing models. We then prove a central limit theorem for models decomposed in this way, which gives the form of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that will be satisfied in the diffusion limit of such a system. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require state space collapse or tractable workload representations, enabling its application to systems with features such as reneging. We demonstrate the approach on a multiclass, multi-server random order of service queue with reneging and generally distributed interarrival, service, and patience times. In this setting, the state descriptor is measure-valued and the workload is nonlinear in the fluid limit. We prove tightness and derive SDEs satisfied by the diffusion limit. Our results offer a broadly applicable method for diffusion approximations in complex queueing systems without relying on dimension reductions or model-specific structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to define a Boolean entropy notion parallel to the framework of free entropy proposed by Voiculescu. Motivated by the work of Lenczewski and the work of C\'ebron &amp; Gillers, we mainly investigated two random matrix models (the Gaussian Symmetric Block model and the Conditioned GUE model), in which asymptotic Boolean independence appears. We showed a large deviation principle for both models. As a result, the two rate functions coincide up to scaling and are minimized by the Rademacher distribution. Therefore, we refer to the logarithmic integral in the rate function as Boolean entropy. Finally, we proved this logarithmic integral is maximized by the Rademacher distribution and monotone along the Boolean Central Limit Theorem.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral formula for the Hermite polynomials: Combinatorics, Asymptotics and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hermite polynomials are ubiquitous but can be difficult to work with due to their unwieldy definition in terms of derivatives. To remedy this, we showcase an underappreciated Gaussian integral formula for the Hermite polynomials, which is especially useful for generalizing to multivariable Hermite polynomials. Taking this as our definition, we prove many useful consequences, including: 1. Combinatorial interpretations for the Hermite polynomials, including a proof of orthogonality. 2. A more elementary proof of Plancherel--Rotach asymptotics that does not involve residues. 3. Limit theorems for GUE random matrices and Dyson's Brownian motion, including bulk convergence to the semi-circle law and edge convergence to the Airy limit/Tracy-Widom law. 4. An analysis of a phase transition in the spiked GUE random matrix as the top eigenvalue goes from well-separated to attached to the bulk, analogous to the BBP phase transition. 5. Elementary derivations of Edgeworth expansions and multivariable Edgeworth expansions. This article is primarily expository and features many illustrative figures.</description>

      <title>Inversions in Random Permutations Under the Ewens Sampling Distribution With and Without a Prescribed Number of Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we study the inversion statistic of random permutations under the family $(\mathbb{P}_\theta^{(n)})_{\theta \ge 0}$ of Ewens sampling distributions on $S_n$. We obtain a rather simple exact formula for the expected number of inversions under $\mathbb{P}_\theta^{(n)}$. In particular, we show that this expected number of inversions is decreasing in the tilting parameter $\theta$ for any $n$ and that it is convex in $\theta$ for $n \not \in \{3,4\}$ only. Furthermore, we derive an exact formula for the probability that a specific pair of indices $(i,j) \in \{1,\dots,n\}^2$ is inverted and show that this probability is decreasing in $\theta$ if and only if $|j-i| \ge 2$ holds. We also exhibit the asymptotic behavior of these quantities as $n \to \infty$ and $\theta \to \infty$.
  In the second part of our paper, we analyze the inversion statistic of random permutations under~$(\mathbb{P}_\theta^{(n)})_{\theta &gt; 0}$ conditioned on having a prescribed number of fixed points. Again, we obtain exact formulas for the expected number of inversions and for the probability that a specific pair of indices is inverted. Since, as expected, the resulting formulas are rather complicated, we focus on the asymptotic behavior of these quantities as $n \to \infty$, $\theta \to \infty$ and $\theta \to 0$.</description>

      <title>The Dual Burnside Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a classical Markov chain for sampling uniformly from group orbits. We introduce the dual Burnside process, obtained by interchanging the roles of group elements and states. This dual chain has stationary law $\pi(g)\propto |X_g|$, is reversible, and admits a matrix factorization $Q=AB$, $K=BA$ with the classical Burnside kernel $K$. As a consequence the two chains share all nonzero eigenvalues and have mixing times that differ by at most one step. We further establish universal Doeblin floors, orbit and conjugacy-class lumpings, and transfer principles between $Q$ and $K$. We analyze explicit examples: the value-permutation model $S_k$ acting on $[k]^n$ and the coordinate-permutation model $S_n$ acting on $[k]^n$. These results show that the dual chain provides both a conceptual mirror to the classical Burnside process and practical advantages for symmetry-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Circular law for non-Hermitian block band matrices with slowly growing bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the empirical eigenvalue distribution for a class of non-Hermitian random block tridiagonal matrices $T$ with independent entries. The matrix has $n$ blocks on the diagonal and each block has size $\ell_n$, so the whole matrix has size $n\ell_n$. We assume that the nonzero entries are i.i.d. with mean 0, variance 1 and having sufficiently high moments. We prove that when the entries have a bounded density, then whenever $\lim_{n\to\infty}\ell_n=\infty$ and $\ell_n=O(\operatorname{Poly}(n))$, the normalized empirical spectral distribution of $T$ converges almost surely to the circular law. The growing bandwidth condition $\lim _{n\to\infty}\ell_n=\infty$ is the optimal condition of circular law with small bandwidth. This confirms the folklore conjecture that the circular law holds whenever the bandwidth increases with the dimension, while all existing results for the circular law are only proven in the delocalized regime $\ell_n\gg n$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a double secretary problem which contains $2n$ applicants of $n$ different qualities, two of each quality. As in the classical secretary problem (CSP), the applicants are interviewed sequentially in a random order by a manager and the manager wants to find an optimal stopping rule that maximizes the probability of selecting one of the two best applicants. We prove that the problem leads to a monotone structure and so the corresponding one-stage look-ahead rule (which is of threshold type) is optimal. The limiting behavior of the rule and of the maximum probability are studied and compared with that of the CSP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as distributing preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers often use seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify intervention impact. However, building a complete sexual activity network is typically infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, observed sequences of sexual contacts, without full network reconstruction. This raises two challenges: protecting individual privacy in these samples and adapting seeding algorithms to incomplete data. We study differential privacy guarantees for influence maximization when the input consists of randomly collected cascades. Building on recent advances in costly seeding, we propose privacy-preserving algorithms that introduce randomization in data or outputs and bound the privacy loss of each node. Theoretical analysis and simulations on synthetic and real-world sexual contact data show that performance degrades gracefully as privacy budgets tighten, with central privacy regimes achieving better trade-offs than local ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective stochastic linear programming with recourse and flexible decision making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal inventory leads to stochastic optimization problems where deterministic delivery decisions have to be made in advance of stochastic demand realizations. Similarly, risk deposits have to be given before the random outcomes of investments are known. In this paper, multi-criteria versions of such stochastic recourse problems are studied. In addition to traditional concepts like Pareto-optimality, a decision maker for the multi-criteria problem may have a preference for greater flexibility in the second stage decision. This idea leads to a first stage optimization problem with a set-valued objective instead of a mere multi-criteria one. Under linearity assumptions, this problem becomes a polyhedral convex set optimization problem instead of a multi-objective linear program. Solution concepts for multi-objective/set-valued recourse problems are given as well as deterministic surrogates of the stochastic problem such as its deterministic equivalent, the so-called wait-and-see problem and the expected-value problem for the multi-objective case. Managerial decision making guidelines are obtained based on set optimization methods and the preference-for-flexibility approach: choose the deterministic first stage variable such that a maximum of flexibility is combined with a guarantee for Pareto minimal objective values. Two major examples illustrate the findings, a multi-objective newsvendor problem with an additional health/sustainability objective and a risk compensation problem where the availability of more than one asset for risk compensation, e.g., several currencies, leads to multiple objectives.</description>

Abstract: The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In the simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a hidden random reward. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive order, and gains the difference between the largest revealed reward and the sum of the inspection costs. Although this classic version is well understood (Weitzman 1979), there is a flourishing recent literature on variants of the problem. Here we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., by constraining the schedules of exploration and influencing costs and rewards. In our framework, boxes have time-dependent rewards and costs, whereas inspection may require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time. Our main result is an efficient constant-factor approximation to the optimal strategy for the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, which is generally NP-hard to compute. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, boxes are available only in specific time slots, or when costs and reward distributions are time-independent (but rewards may still deteriorate after inspection).</description>

      <title>Analyzing Scalogram Ridges in the Presence of Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While ridges in the scalogram, determined by the squared modulus of analytic wavelet transform (AWT), is a widely accepted concept and utilized in nonstationary time series analysis, their behavior in noisy environments remains underexplored. Our object is to provide a theoretical foundation for scalogram ridges by defining ridges as a potentially set-valued random process connecting local maxima of the scalogram along the scale axis and analyzing their properties when the signal fulfills the adaptive harmonic model and is contaminated by stationary Gaussian noise. In addition to establishing several key properties of the AWT for random processes, we investigate the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting random ridge points in the scalogram. Specifically, we establish the uniqueness property of the ridge point at individual time instances and prove the upper hemicontinuity of the ridge random process. Furthermore, we derive bounds on the probability that the deviation between the ridges of noisy and clean signals exceeds a specified threshold, and these bounds depend on the signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve these ridge deviation results, we derive maximal inequalities for the complex modulus of nonstationary Gaussian processes, leveraging classical tools such as the Borell-TIS inequality and Dudley's theorem, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of the characteristic polynomials of random tridiagonal matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis for certain Dedekind zeta functions, we show that the characteristic polynomial of a class of random tridiagonal matrices of large dimension is irreducible, with probability exponentially close to one; moreover, its Galois group over the rational numbers is either the symmetric or the alternating group. This is the counterpart of the results of Breuillard--Varj\'u (for polynomials with independent coefficients), and with those of Eberhard and Ferber--Jain--Sah--Sawhney (for full random matrices). We also analyse a related class of random tridiagonal matrices for which the Galois group is much smaller.</description>

      <title>Towards Markov-State Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences of visited states for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This motivates the notion of "weak Markov order" and provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Multiple-try Metropolis algorithm using the framework of Poincar\'e inequalities. We describe the Multiple-try Metropolis as an auxiliary variable implementation of a resampling approximation to an ideal Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. Under suitable moment conditions on the importance weights, we derive explicit Poincar\'e comparison results between the Multiple-try algorithm and the ideal algorithm. We characterize the spectral gap of the latter, and finally in the Gaussian case prove explicit non-asymptotic convergence bounds for Multiple-try Metropolis by comparison.</description>

      <title>Comparison for semi-continuous viscosity solutions for second order PDEs on the Wasserstein space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a comparison result for semi-continuous viscosity solutions of a class of second-order PDEs in the Wasserstein space. This allows us to remove the Lipschitz continuity assumption with respect to the Fourier-Wasserstein distance in AriX: 2309.05040 and obtain uniqueness by directly working in the Wasserstein space. In terms of its application, we characterize the value function of a stochastic control problem with partial observation as the unique viscosity solution to its corresponding HJB equation. Additionally, we present an application to a prediction problem under partial monitoring, where we establish an upper bound on the limit of regret using our comparison principle for degenerate dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the Implied Volatility in the Bachelier setting, extending the framework introduced by Benaim and Friz for the Black-Scholes setting. Exploiting the theory of regular variation, we derive explicit expressions for the Bachelier Implied Volatility in the wings of the smile, linking these to the tail behaviour of the underlying's returns' distribution. Furthermore, we establish a direct connection between the analyticity strip of the returns' characteristic function and the asymptotic formula for the Implied Volatility smile at extreme moneyness.</description>

      <title>Private Evolution Converges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework to understand PE's practical behavior and identify sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive datasets with $n$ data points from a convex and compact domain, we prove that under the right hyperparameter settings and given access to the Gaussian variation API proposed in \cite{PE23}, PE produces an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein distance $\tilde{O}(d(n\varepsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original; this establishes worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our theoretical findings in experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Subspace Embeddings: Resolving Nelson-Nguyen Conjecture Up to Sub-Polylogarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].</description>

      <title>Spectral gap with polynomial rate for Weil-Petersson random surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that a genus $g$ closed hyperbolic surface, sampled at random from the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g}$ with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure, has Laplacian spectral gap at least $\frac{1}{4}-O\left(\frac{1}{g^{c}}\right)$ with probability tending to $1$ as $g\to\infty$. This extends and gives a new proof of a recent result of Anantharaman and Monk proved in the series of works [2,3,5,4,6].
  Our approach adapts the polynomial method for the strong convergence of random matrices, introduced by Chen, Garza-Vargas, Tropp and van Handel [19], and its generalization to the strong convergence of surface groups by Magee, Puder and van Handel [41], to the Laplacian on Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

      <title>Why Cannot Neural Networks Master Extrapolation? Insights from Physical Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a quantitative variant of the classic Two Doors logic puzzle, in which the answer space is no longer binary, for example when the goal is to recover a numerical fact (such as one's true weight) rather than choose between two doors. The puzzle retains the original structure: one agent always tells the truth, the other always lies. Our central contribution is to identify a class of self-referential prompts that successfully extract the correct quantitative answer under minimal assumptions. We also explore how well does \texttt{ChatGPT} does in reasoning for this problem which is just a little bit out of distribution.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an inhomogeneous variant of random 2-SAT. Each variable $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ is assigned a type from a state space $\Lambda$, independently at random. Clause inclusion is governed by a symmetric measurable kernel $W$ on $(\Lambda \times \{+,-\})^2$, in analogy with the inhomogeneous random graph model of Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan: given literals $\ell_i\in\{v_i,\neg v_i\}$ and $\ell_j\in\{v_j,\neg v_j\}$, the clause $\{\ell_i,\ell_j\}$ appears with probability $W(\mathrm{type}(\ell_i),\mathrm{type}(\ell_j))/(2n)$. In particular, for a variable $v_i$ of type $x\in\Lambda$, the slices $W((+,x),\cdot)$ and $W((-,x),\cdot)$ describe how $v_i$ and $\neg v_i$ interact with other literals.
  We identify a parameter $\rho^*(W)$, defined as the spectral radius of an integral operator derived from $W$, and show that $\rho^*(W)&lt;1$ and $\rho^*(W)&gt;1$ correspond to asymptotically almost surely satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances, respectively. The satisfiability threshold for homogeneous random 2-SAT is well-established, occurring when the ratio of clauses to variables is $1$. This corresponds to a weight function of $W \equiv 1$ and a clause density of $1/(2n)$. Our result extends this classical result to a broad class of models controlled by types of variables.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of the volume, surface area, and other geometric properties of sections of convex bodies, and in particular cubes, has a long history and a rich literature. However, much less is known when the cube has a volume distribution that is different from the Lebesgue measure; for example, a Gaussian density. We study the probability densities in the unit cube $C^n=[-1,1]^n$ of $\mathbb R^n$ generated by $e^{-b\|x\|^2}$, $b&gt; 0$. We prove that the limit of the induced Gaussian-type volume of sections of $C^n$ through the origin and orthogonal to a main diagonal is \[ \sqrt{\frac b\pi}\left (1-4\frac{e^{-b}\sqrt{b}}{2\sqrt{\pi}\mathrm{erf}(\sqrt{b})}\right)^{-\frac12}, \] as $n\to\infty$. This extends the well-known result of Hensley (1979) for the Lebesgue measure and continues the investigations initiated by Barthe, Gu\'edon, Mendelson, Naor (2005), Zvavitch (2008), and K\"onig, Koldobski (2013). The proof uses a mixture of techniques from analysis and probability.</description>

      <title>Average Winding Number for Determinantal Curves associated with 2-Matrix Models in the Class AIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To classify one-dimensional disordered quantum systems with chiral symmetry, we analyse the winding number of the determinant of a parametrized non-Hermitian random matrix field over the unit circle modelling the off-diagonal block of a disordered chiral Hamiltonian. The associated partition function is computed explicitly for a broad class of additive two-matrix models extending beyond the Ginibre Unitary Ensemble. In the large-dimension limit, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the average winding number whose leading term exhibits universal features, up to the tail behaviour of the underlying random matrix ensemble, and identify a new correction term absent in the previously studied Ginibre case.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for the Landau equation via microcanonical binary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully constructive, conservative, and collision-level realization of Kac's program for the spatially homogeneous Landau equation across the full interaction range, including the Coulomb case. Our model is the microcanonical binary-collision (MBC) process: a reversible pure-jump $N$-particle Markov process that is Landau-native, realizing the grazing-collision mechanism via small conservative rotations of relative velocities. The analysis hinges on two critical structural pillars: a Fisher-information dissipation mechanism that extends the Guill\'en--Silvestre paradigm (Acta Math. 234:315-375, 2025) to a genuinely conservative particle system, yielding robust control of singular configurations, and a quantitative self-averaging principle that enforces a coherent deterministic emergence of the Landau flow from the microscopic dynamics. We prove propagation of chaos in the joint mean-field and grazing-collision limit ($N\to\infty, h\to 0$), identifying any limit point with the unique global solution to the Landau equation. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the Landau master equation as the grazing-collision limit of the MBC process. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first fully conservative, Landau-native binary-collision model rigorously shown to produce the Landau equation over the entire interaction range.</description>
