      <title>On \'Etale Algebras and Bosonic Fusion 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all connected and Lagrangian \'etale algebras in the Drinfeld center $\mathscr{Z}_1(\mathbf{2Vect}^\pi_G)$, where $G$ is a finite group and $\pi$ is a 4-cocycle on $G$. By D\'ecoppet's result every bosonic fusion 2-category $\mathfrak{C}$ has its Drinfeld center equivalent to $\mathscr{Z}_1(\mathbf{2Vect}^\pi_G)$ for some $G$ and $\pi$. Combining this fact with classification of Lagrangian algebras in $\mathscr{Z}_1(\mathbf{2Vect}^\pi_G)$, we obtain a classification of bosonic fusion 2-categories.</description>

      <title>The Aldous--Hoover Theorem in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aldous-Hoover Theorem concerns an infinite matrix of random variables whose distribution is invariant under finite permutations of rows and columns. It states that, up to equality in distribution, each random variable in the matrix can be expressed as a function only depending on four key variables: one common to the entire matrix, one that encodes information about its row, one that encodes information about its column, and a fourth one specific to the matrix entry.
  We state and prove the theorem within a category-theoretic approach to probability, namely the theory of Markov categories. This makes the proof more transparent and intuitive when compared to measure-theoretic ones. A key role is played by a newly identified categorical property, the Cauchy--Schwarz axiom, which also facilitates a new synthetic de Finetti Theorem.
  We further provide a variant of our proof using the ordered Markov property and the d-separation criterion, both generalized from Bayesian networks to Markov categories. We expect that this approach will facilitate a systematic development of more complex results in the future, such as categorical approaches to hierarchical exchangeability.</description>

      <title>A duality for the class of compact $T_1$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a contravariant adjunction between compact $T_1$-spaces and a class of distributive lattices which recomprises key portions of Stone's duality and of Isbell's duality among its instantiations. This brings us to focus on $T_1$-spaces, rather than sober spaces, and to identify points in them with minimal prime filters on some base for a $T_1$-topology (which is what Stone's duality does on the base of clopen sets of compact $0$-dimensional spaces), in spite of completely prime filters on the topology (which is what Isbell's duality does on a sober space).
  More precisely our contravariant adjunction produces a contravariant, faithful and full embedding of the category of compact $T_1$-spaces with arrows given by closed continuous map as a reflective subcategory of a category $\mathsf{SbfL} $ whose objects are the bounded distributive lattices isomorphic to some base of a $T_1$-topological space (e.g. subfits, when the lattices are frames) and whose arrows are given by (what we call) set-like-morphisms (a natural class of morphisms characterized by a first order expressible constraint).
  Furthermore this contravariant adjunction becomes a duality when one restricts on the topological side to the category of compact $T_2$-spaces with arbitrary continuous maps, and on the lattice-theoretic side to the category of compact, complete, and normal lattices.
  A nice by-product of the above results is a lattice-theoretic reformulation of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification theorem which we have not been able to trace elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Non-Existence of Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider several types of non-existence theorems for functors. For example, there are no nontrivial functors from the category of groups (or the category of pointed sets, or vector spaces) to any small category. Another type of questions that we consider are questions about nonexistence of subfunctors and quotients of the identity functor on the category of groups (or abelian groups). For example, there is no a natural non-trivial way to define an abelian subgroup of a group, or a perfect quotient group of a group. As an auxiliary result we prove that, for any non-trivial subfunctor $F$ of the identity functor on the category of groups, any group can be embedded into a simple group that lies in the essential image of $F.$ The paper concludes with a few questions regarding the non-existence of certain (co-)augmented functors in the $\infty$-category of spaces.</description>

      <title>Igusa-Todorov distances, extension and Rouquier dimensions under cleft extensions of abelian categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behavior of Igusa-Todorov distances, extension and Rouquier dimensions under cleft extensions of abelian categories. Applications are given to Morita context rings, trivial extension rings, tensor rings and arrow removals. In particular, we provide a new characterization of the upper bound for the Rouquier dimension of finite-dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Computing $G$-Crossed Extensions and Orbifolds of Vertex Operator Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop tools for computing $G$-crossed extensions of braided tensor categories. Their equivariantisations appear as categories of modules of fixed-point subalgebras (or orbifolds) of vertex operator algebras and are often difficult to determine.
  As the first tool, we show how the seminal work of Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik on the uniqueness of $G$-crossed extensions can be used to determine the category of modules of orbifold vertex operator algebras. As an application, we determine the modular tensor category of the orbifold of a lattice vertex operator algebra under a lift of $-\mathrm{id}$ for a lattice with odd-order discriminant form. In that case, the de-equivariantisation is of Tambara-Yamagami type.
  As the second tool, we describe how $G$-crossed extensions and condensations by commutative algebras commute in a suitable sense. This leads to an effective approach to compute new $G$-crossed extensions. As one application, we produce the coherence data that are then used in arXiv:2411.12251 to define a generalisation of the Tambara-Yamagami categories with more than one simple object in the twisted sector. This also yields the modular tensor category of the orbifold of an arbitrary lattice vertex operator algebra under a lift of $-\mathrm{id}$. Finally, we sketch how to categorically approach the general problem of lattice orbifolds under lifts of arbitrary lattice involutions.</description>
