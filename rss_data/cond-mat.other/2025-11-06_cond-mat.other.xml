      <title>Inertial Repulsion from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for localized vibrational modes in one- and two-dimensional discrete lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous proof that arbitrarily weak perturbations produce localized vibrational (phonon) modes in one- and two-dimensional discrete lattices, inspired by analogous results for the Schr{\"o}dinger and Maxwell equations, and complementing previous explicit solutions for specific perturbations (e.g., decreasing a single mass). In particular, we study monatomic crystals with nearest-neighbor harmonic interactions, corresponding to square lattices of masses and springs, and prove that arbitrary localized perturbations that decrease the net mass lead to localized vibrating modes. The proof employs a straightforward variational method that should be extensible to other discrete lattices, interactions, and perturbations.</description>

      <title>An Extensible Julia Toolkit for Symmetry-Aware Dual Space Phasing in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source Julia-based software toolkit for solving the phase problem using dual-space iterative algorithms. The toolkit is specifically designed for aperiodic crystals and quasicrystals, supporting general space group symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. A key feature is the symmetry-breaking anti-aliasing sampling scheme, optimized for computational efficiency when working with strongly anisotropic diffraction data, common for quasicrystals. This scheme avoids sampling redundancy caused by symmetry constraints, imposed during phasing iterations. The toolkit includes a reference implementation of the charge flipping algorithm and also allows users to implement custom phasing algorithms with fine-grained control over the iterative process.</description>

      <title>Financial Interactions and Collective States: Part I. Investors and Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a network of investors and firms. In that framework, financial agents could invest in firms or in other investors, and banks-introduced as investors with a credit multiplier-could play a stabilizing or destabilizing role. Collective states emerged from these interactions, reflecting different configurations of capital distribution and stability in the financial system. However, these results relied on the assumption that financial connections were exogenous.
  The present paper removes this assumption by modeling financial connections as dynamic endogenous variables. Specifically, we extend the framework by introducing a field representation of the network of financial connections. The collective states previously identified are now embedded in a broader class of states, characterized by the structure of investment stakes among investors. We show that these collective states consist of inter-connected groups of agents, along with their returns and disposable capital. The model reveals the emergence of two investor classes: high- and low-return (and capital) agents. High-return investors, in particular, act as a source of instability within the system, enabling transitions between configurations. In each collective state, some sectors may experience defaults. When the collective state exhibits specific structural conditions, defaults may spread across a significant share of the group.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of Bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ Lattice Induced by Polarized Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of photon-dressed energy bands in bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices under off-resonant circularly polarized light, focusing on aligned and cyclic stacking configurations. Analytical expressions for quasi-energy bands are derived for aligned stacking, while numerical results address cyclic stacking at Dirac points. Circularly polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracies at the intersections $t^{a,c}$, leading to the appearance of a Haldane-type Chern insulator in the absence of a magnetic field . At $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, orbital magnetic moments of corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, as do their Berry curvatures. For $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, light-induced band deformations near Dirac points create gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum, where the chemical potential modulates orbital magnetization. Linear magnetization variations align with Chern numbers, yielding quantized anomalous Hall conductivity across stacking types. Notable particle-hole symmetry breaking within $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ suggests applications in valley caloritronics and quantum sensing. At $\alpha = 1$, flat and corrugated bands remain undistorted; while the flat band contributes no Berry curvature, it produces a finite negative orbital magnetic moment, contrasting with the positive moment of the corrugated band.</description>

      <title>Is there a conflict between causality and diamagnetism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. However, experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.</description>
