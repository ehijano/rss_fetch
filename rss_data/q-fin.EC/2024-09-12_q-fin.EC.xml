      <title>Mechanisms for belief elicitation without ground truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article examines the challenge of eliciting truthful information from multiple individuals when such information cannot be verified against an objective truth, a problem known as information elicitation without verification (IEWV). This article reviews over 25 mechanisms designed to incentivize truth-telling in such scenarios, and their effectiveness in empirical studies. The analysis finds that although many mechanisms theoretically ensure truthfulness as a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, empirical evidence of such mechanisms working in practice is very limited and generally weak. Consequently, more empirical research is needed to validate mechanisms. Given that many mechanisms are very complex and cannot be easily conveyed to research subjects, this review suggests that simpler, more intuitive mechanisms may be easier to test and apply.</description>

      <title>Policy consequences of the new neuroeconomic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current theories of decision making suggest that the neural circuits in mammalian brains (including humans) computationally combine representations of the past (memory), present (perception), and future (agentic goals) to take actions that achieve the needs of the agent. How information is represented within those neural circuits changes what computations are available to that system which changes how agents interact with their world to take those actions. We argue that the computational neuroscience of decision making provides a new microeconomic framework (neuroeconomics) that offers new opportunities to construct policies that interact with those decision-making systems to improve outcomes. After laying out the computational processes underlying decision making in mammalian brains, we present four applications of this logic with policy consequences: (1) contingency management as a treatment for addiction, (2) precommitment and the sensitivity to sunk costs, (3) media consequences for changes in housing prices after a disaster, and (4) how social interactions underlie the success (and failure) of microfinance institutions.</description>

      <title>Distilling Data from Large Language Models: An Application to Research Productivity Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for assigning high-quality labels to unstructured text. The method is based on fine-tuning an open-source language model with data extracted from a proprietary large language model. We apply this method to construct a census of published clinical trials. We revisit a literature that contends that pharmaceutical research productivity is declining, based on measured increases in the quantity of clinical trials, which outpace trends in output. In our data, the quantity and composition of trials are stable since 2010. Previous measurements are an artifact of biases driven by shifts in the composition of other forms of research.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Mismatch in Labor Markets via Public Employment Security Offices in Japan, 1972-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine changes in matching efficiency and elasticities in Japan's labor market via Hello Work for unemployed workers from January 1972 to April 2024 using a nonparametric identification approach by y Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). I find a declining trend in matching efficiency, consistent with decreasing job and worker finding rates. The implied match elasticity with respect to unemployment is 0.5-0.9, whereas the implied match elasticity with respect to vacancies varies between -0.4 and 0.4. Decomposing aggregate data into full-time and part-time ones, I find that the sharp decline of matching efficiency after 2015 shown in the aggregate trend is driven by the decline of both full-time and part-time ones. Second, I extend the mismatch index proposed by Sahin et al (2014) to the nonparametric version and develop the computational methodology. I find that the mismatch across occupations is more severe than across prefectures and the original Cobb-Douglas mismatch index is underestimated.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Crypto Rewards in Fundraising: From a Quasi-Experiment to a Dictator Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional thank-you gifts are one of the most widely used incentives for charitable giving. Past studies explored non-monetary thank-you gifts (e.g., mugs and shirts) and monetary thank-you gifts (e.g., rebates that return some of the donations to the giver). Following the rapid growth of blockchain technology, a novel form of thank-you gifts emerged: the crypto rewards. Through two studies, we analyze crypto thank-you gifts to shed light on fundraising designs in the digital world. In Study I, we examine the Ukrainian government's crypto fundraising plea that accepts donations in both Ethereum and Bitcoin. We find that Ethereum is substantially more effective in enticing giving than Bitcoin, as the hourly donation count increased 706.07% more for Ethereum than for Bitcoin when crypto rewards are present. This is likely because the crypto rewards are more likely to be issued on Ethereum than Bitcoin. However, the decrease in contribution sizes is also more substantial in Ethereum than in Bitcoin in response to the crypto rewards. In Study II, we conducted a laboratory experiment following a dictator game design to investigate the impact of crypto rewards in a more general scenario, with the crypto rewards specified as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The crypto rewards in Study II carry no monetary value but only serve to recognize donors symbolically. As such, the NFT thank-you gifts did not effectively induce people to donate; a traditional 1:1 donation matching strictly outperforms both the condition without thank-you gifts and the condition with NFT thank-you gifts. Nevertheless, the NFT thank-you gifts effectively increased the contribution sizes, conditional on the choice to give, when the NFT's graphic design primes donor identity and encompasses the charity recipient.</description>
