      <title>Broadband Multi-wavelength Properties of M87 during the 2018 EHT Campaign including a Very High Energy Flaring Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Ray Sources can be Gamma-ray Dim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, accelerated hadrons that can exceed energies of $10^{20}$ eV, are the highest-energy particles ever observed. While the sources producing UHECRs are still unknown, the Pierre Auger Observatory has detected a large-scale dipole anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 8 EeV. In this work, we explore whether resolved gamma-ray sources can reproduce the Auger dipole. We use various Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogs as sources of cosmic rays in CRPropa simulations. We find that in all cases, the simulated dipole has an amplitude significantly larger than that measured by Auger, even when considering large extragalactic magnetic field strengths and optimistic source weighting schemes. Our result implies that the resolved gamma-ray sources are insufficient to account for the population of sources producing the highest-energy cosmic rays, and there must exist a population of UHECR sources that lack gamma-ray emission or are unresolved by the current-generation gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>The NuSTAR Serendipitous Survey: the 80-month catalog and source properties of the high-energy emitting AGN and quasar population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of hard X-ray serendipitous sources detected in the first 80 months of observations by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). The NuSTAR serendipitous survey 80-month (NSS80) catalog has an unprecedented $\sim$ 62 Ms of effective exposure time over 894 unique fields (a factor of three increase over the 40-month catalog), with an areal coverage of $\sim $36 deg$^2$, larger than all NuSTAR extragalactic surveys. NSS80 provides 1274 hard X-ray sources in the $3-24$ keV band (822 new detections compared to the previous 40-month catalog). Approximately 76% of the NuSTAR sources have lower-energy ($&lt;10$ keV) X-ray counterparts from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT. We have undertaken an extensive campaign of ground-based spectroscopic follow-up to obtain new source redshifts and classifications for 427 sources. Combining these with existing archival spectroscopy provides redshifts for 550 NSS80 sources, of which 547 are classified. The sample is primarily composed of active galactic nuclei (AGN), detected over a large range in redshift ($z$ = 0.012-3.43), but also includes 58 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic sources. In addition, five AGN/galaxy pairs, one dual AGN system, one BL Lac candidate, and a hotspot of 4C 74.26 (radio quasar) have been identified. The median rest-frame $10-40$ keV luminosity and redshift of the NSS80 are $\langle{L_\mathrm{10-40 keV}}\rangle$ = 1.2 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $\langle z \rangle = 0.56$. We investigate the optical properties and construct composite optical spectra to search for subtle signatures not present in the individual spectra, finding an excess of redder BL AGN compared to optical quasar surveys predominantly due to the presence of the host-galaxy and, at least in part, due to dust obscuration.</description>

      <title>A three-parameter characterization of neutron stars' mass-radius relation and equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous models of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) exist based on different superdense-matter physics approaches. Nevertheless, some NS properties show universal (EoS-independent) relations. Here, we propose a novel class of such universalities. Despite different physics inputs, a wide class of realistic nucleonic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models can be accurately described using only three parameters. For a given EoS, these are the mass and radius of the maximum-mass NS (or pressure and density in its center) and the radius of a half-maximum-mass star. With such a parametrization, we build universal analytic expressions for mass-radius and pressure-density relations. They form a semi-analytic mapping from the mass-radius relation to the EoS in NS cores (the so-called inverse Oppenheimer-Volkoff mapping). This mapping simplifies the process of inferring the EoS from observations of NS masses and radii. Applying it to current NS observations we set new limits on the high end of the EoS.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of two peculiar long Gamma-ray bursts: GRB 230307A and GRB 211211A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 211211A is a peculiar long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) with very high brightness and short burst properties. It's full lightcurve consists of three emission episodes, i.e. a precursor, a main burst and a extended emission. We find a recently detected long-duration GRB 230307A also includes the three consistent emission episodes. Furthermore, the two bursts have similar redshift 0.076 and 0.065, respectively. We perform a detail temporal and spectral analysis of the two GRBs to compare their temporal and spectral properties. Our analysis shows that the two bursts share great similarities for both the whole emission and the three corresponding emission phases, which are listed as follows: (1) they have near zero spectral lag, (2) they have very short minimum variability timescale (MVT), (3) they lie in the same region of in the MVT-$T_{90}$, Amati relation, and hardness-$T_{90}$ planes, (4) the three phases are quasi-thermal spectra, (5) both the peak energy and the low-energy index track the flux, (6) the time-resolved spectra are much wider than those of the blackbody prediced by theory model, (7) there are strong correlations between thermal flux and total flux and the correlation coefficients as well as the slopes for the corresponding stages are very consistent, (8) the photosphere emission properties are very consistent. Other investigations and observations suggest the two GRBs indeed belong to short burst with a compact star merger origin. Therefore, we think that GRB 230307A and GRB 211211A are the rare and similar GRBs and the photospheric radiation can interpret their radiation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The time evolution of fast flavor crossings in post-merger disks around a black hole remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We postprocess a three-dimensional general relativistic, full transport neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of the black hole--accretion disk--wind system thought to be a potential outcome of the GW170817 merger to investigate the presence of electron lepton number (ELN-XLN) crossings in the neutrino angular distribution. Neutrinos are evolved with an explicit Monte Carlo method and can interact with matter via emission, absorption, or scattering. Within the postprocessing framework, we find ubiquitous occurrence of ELN-XLN crossings at early times ($\sim$ 11ms) but this does not hold for later times in the simulation. At postmerger times of $ \sim$ 60 ms and beyond, ELN-XLN crossings are only present near the equator. We provide a detailed analysis of the neutrino radiation field to investigate the origin and time evolution of these crossings. Previous reports have suggested ubiquitous flavor crossings persisting throughout the simulation lifetime, albeit for different sets of conditions for the merger remnant, the treatment of hydrodynamics and neutrino transport. Even though we do not perform a direct comparison with other published works, we qualitatively assess the reasons for the difference with our results. The geometric structure and evolution of the ELN-XLN crossings found in our analysis, and by extension, fast flavor instabilities have important implications for heavy element nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Decretion disc size in Be/X-ray binaries depends upon the disc aspect ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations we show that the size of the decretion disc and the structure of the accretion flow onto the neutron star in a Be/X-ray binary strongly depends upon the disc aspect ratio, $H/R$. We simulate a Be star disc that is coplanar to the orbit of a circularly or moderately eccentric neutron star companion, thereby maximising the effects of tidal truncation. For low disc aspect ratio, $H/R\lesssim 0.1$, the disc is efficiently tidally truncated by the neutron star. Most material that escapes the Roche lobe of the Be star is accreted by the neutron star through tidal streams. For larger disc aspect ratio, the outflow rate through the Be star disc is higher, tidal truncation becomes inefficient, the disc fills the Roche lobe and extends to the orbit of the companion. Some material escapes the binary as a gas stream that begins near the L2 point. While the accretion rate onto the neutron star is higher, the fraction of the outflow that is accreted by the neutron star is smaller. Low density Be star discs are expected to be approximately isothermal, such that $H/R$ increases with radius. Tidal truncation is therefore weaker for larger separation binaries, and lower mass primaries.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a [O III] Emission Shell Around the X-ray Binary CI Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a $8' \times 12'$ emission shell brightest in [O III] centered on the X-ray binary B[e] star, CI Cameleopardalis (CI Cam). This shell, detected during a survey of optical emission associated with the Galactic supernova remnant G150.3+4.5, is seen outside but immediately adjacent to the remnant's optical filaments along its northwestern edge. Assuming this shell is related to CI Cam's strong winds and transient outbursts, the adoption of CI Cam's Gaia DR3 statistically corrected distance of 4.1$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc yields shell dimensions $\simeq$ 9.5 pc $\times$ 14.3 pc. While the distance to the G150.3+4.5 remnant is uncertain, the appearance of CI Cam's emission shell so close to the SNR's optical filaments appears likely to be a chance coincidence.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave radiation from magnetar-driven supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly spinning magnetars are potential candidates for the energy source of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts and the most promising sources for continuous gravitational waves (GWs) detected by ground-based GW detectors. Continuous GWs can be radiated from magnetars due to magnetic-induced deformation or fluid oscillations, compatible with magnetic dipole (MD) radiation for spin-down energy. In this paper, we investigate the diverse light curves of magnetar-driven SNe in the scenario that the spin-down is dominated by GW radiation and/or MD radiation. By simulating the light curves of SNe and employing the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we constrain the parameters of the magnetars and SN explosions and show that the signature of GW radiation may be indicated by the bolometric luminosity curves of SNe Ic-BL 2007ru and 2009bb. We find that the ellipticity of magnetars in the order of $10^{-3}$ can be induced by the magnetic field of $\sim 10^{16} \mbox{ G}$. If such continuous GWs associated with SNe can be detected in the future by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, this would be a smoking gun for a magnetar engine powering SNe.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the first anti-glitch event in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR B0540-69</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) observatory, we identified a permanent spin frequency decrease of $\Delta\nu=-(1.04\pm0.07)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{Hz}$ around MJD 60132 in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR B0540-69, which exhibits a periodic signal at a frequency of $\nu\sim 19.6\,\mathrm{Hz}$. This points to an anti-glitch event, a sudden decrease of the pulsar's rotational frequency without any major alteration in the pulse profile or any significant increase of the pulsed flux. Additionally, no burst activity was observed in association with the anti-glitch. To date, observations of the few known anti-glitches have been made in magnetars or accreting pulsars. This is the first anti-glitch detected in a rotation-powered pulsar. Given its radiatively quiet nature, this anti-glitch is possibly of internal origin. Therefore, we tentatively frame this event within a proposed mechanism for anti-glitches where the partial `evaporation' of the superfluid component leads to an increase of the normal component's moment of inertia and a decrease of the superfluid one.</description>

      <title>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. V. Distance Estimation with Neutrinos Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multi-messenger observations of supernovae. Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to supernovae using quantitative analysis techniques for supernova neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star and the distance to the supernova. The radius of a neutron star is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the supernova can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of supernovae, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multi-messenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to supernovae through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of neutron star radii. This data, via the neutron star mass-radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Pre-peak Emission in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising part of a tidal disruption event light curve provides unique insight into early emission and the onset of accretion. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain the pre-peak emission, including shocks from debris interaction and reprocessing of disk emission. We study the pre-peak emission and its influence on the gas circularization by a series of gray radiation hydrodynamic simulations with varying black hole mass. We find that given a super-Eddington fallback rate of 10\dot{M}_{Edd}, the stream-stream collision can occur multiple times and drive strong outflows of up to 9\dot{M}_{Edd}. By dispersing gas to \gtrsim 100rs, the outflow can delay gas circularization and leads to sub-Eddington accretion rates during the first few stream-stream collisions. The stream-stream collision shock and circularization shock can sustain a luminosity of ~10^{44}erg/s for days. The luminosity is generally sub-Eddington and shows a weak correlation with accretion rate at early time. The outflow is optically thick, yielding a reprocessing layer with a size of ~10^{14} cm and photospheric temperature of ~4\times10^{4}K.</description>

      <title>Evolution of secondary electron spectrum during cosmic-ray discharge in the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm's law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, the electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field, but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that are observed in some molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The population of Galactic supernova remnants in the TeV range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are likely to be significant sources of cosmic rays up to the knee of the local cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum. They produce gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) ($E&gt;0.1$ TeV) range via: hadronic interactions with the interstellar medium and leptonic interactions with soft photons. Current observations have lead to the detection of about a dozen of VHE SNRs and future instruments should increase this number. The details of particle acceleration at SNRs, and of the mechanisms producing VHE gamma-rays at SNRs are poorly understood. We aim to study the population of SNRs detected in the TeV range and its properties, and to address fundamental questions of particle acceleration at SNR shocks: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of acceleration? Is the VHE emission dominated by hadronic or leptonic interactions? By means of Monte Carlo methods, we simulate the population of SNRs in the VHE domain and confront our simulations to H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). We explore the parameter space: the slope of accelerated particles $\alpha$, the electron-to-proton ratio $K_{\rm ep}$, and the efficiency of particle acceleration $\xi $. We found sets of parameters for which $\gtrsim 90$\% of realisations are found in agreements with the HGPS data. These parameters are found $ 4.2 \gtrsim \alpha \gtrsim 4.1 $, $10^{-5} \lesssim K_{\rm ep} \lesssim 10^{-4.5}$, and $0.03 \lesssim \xi\lesssim 0.1 $ . We were able to strongly argue against some regions of the parameter space: $\alpha \lesssim 4.05$, $\alpha \gtrsim 4.35$, or $K_{\rm ep} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$. Our model is so far able to explain the SNR population of the HGPS. Our approach, confronted to the results of future systematic surveys, will help remove degeneracy in the solutions, and to better understand particle acceleration at SNR shocks.</description>

      <title>Dynamical ejecta from binary neutron star mergers: Impact of residual eccentricity and equation of state implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the properties of the matter ejected during and after a neutron star merger is crucial to our ability to use electromagnetic observations of these mergers to constrain the masses of the neutron stars, the equation of state of dense matter, and the role of neutron star mergers in the enrichment of the Universe in heavy elements. Our ability to reliably provide such predictions is however limited by a broad range of factors, including the finite resolution of numerical simulations, their treatment of magnetic fields, neutrinos, and neutrino-matter interactions, and the approximate modeling of the equation of state of dense matter. In this manuscript, we study specifically the role that a small residual eccentricity and different implementations of the same equation of state have on the matter ejected during the merger of a $1.3M_\odot-1.4M_\odot$ binary neutron star system. We find that a residual eccentricity $e\sim 0.01$, as measured $\sim 4-6$ orbits before merger, causes $O(25\%-30\%)$ changes in the amount of ejected mass, mainly due to changes in the amount of matter ejected as a result of core bounces during merger. We note that $O(1\%)$ residual eccentricities have regularly been used in binary neutron star merger simulations as proxy for circular binaries, potentially creating an additional source of error in predictions for the mass of the dynamical ejecta.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star mergers with massive neutron stars in numerical relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the merger of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in numerical relativity, focusing on the properties of the remnant disk and the ejecta, varying the mass of compactness of the NS and the mass and spin of the BH. We find that within the precision of our numerical simulations, the remnant disk mass and ejecta mass normalized by the NS baryon mass ($\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$, respectively), and the cutoff frequency $f_{\rm{cut}}$ normalized by the initial total gravitational mass of the system at infinite separation approximately agree among the models with the same NS compactness $C_{\rm{NS}}=M_{\rm{NS}}/R_{\rm{NS}}$, mass ratio $Q=M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\rm{NS}}$, and dimensionless BH spin $\chi_{\rm{BH}}$ irrespective of the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ in the range of $1.092$--$1.691\,M_\odot$. This result shows that the merger outcome depends sensitively on $Q$, $\chi_{\rm BH}$, and $C_{\rm{NS}}$ but only weekly on $M_{\rm{NS}}$. This justifies the approach of studying the dependence of NS tidal disruptions on the NS compactness by fixing the NS mass but changing the EOS. We further perform simulations with massive NSs of $M_{\rm{NS}}=1.8M_{\odot}$, and compare our results of $\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$ with those given by existing fitting formulas to test their robustness for more compact NSs. We find that the fitting formulas obtained in the previous studies are accurate within the numerical errors assumed, while our results also suggest that further improvement is possible by systematically performing more precise numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Luminous giants populate the dense Cosmic Web: The radio luminosity-environmental density relation for radio galaxies in action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant radio galaxies (GRGs, giant RGs, or giants) are megaparsec-scale, jet-driven outflows from accretion disks of supermassive black holes, and represent the most extreme pathway by which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. A long-standing but unresolved question is why giants are so much larger than other radio galaxies. It has been proposed that, in addition to having higher jet powers than most RGs, giants might live in especially low-density Cosmic Web environments. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis by pinpointing Local Universe giants and other RGs in physically principled, Bayesian large-scale structure reconstructions. More specifically, we localised a LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2-dominated sample of luminous ($l_\nu(\nu = 150\ \mathrm{MHz}) \geq 10^{24}\ \mathrm{W\ Hz^{-1}}$) giants and a control sample of LoTSS DR1 RGs, both with spectroscopic redshifts up to $z_\mathrm{max} = 0.16$, in the BORG SDSS Cosmic Web reconstructions. We measured the Cosmic Web density for each RG; for the control sample, we then quantified the relation between RG radio luminosity and Cosmic Web density. With the BORG SDSS tidal tensor, we also measured for each RG whether the gravitational dynamics of its Cosmic Web environment resemble those of clusters, filaments, sheets, or voids. Luminous giants populate large-scale environments that tend to be denser than those of general RGs. This shows that -- at least at high jet powers -- low-density environments are no prerequisite for giant growth. This result is corroborated by gravitational dynamics classification and a cluster catalogue crossmatching analysis. This work presents more than a thousand inferred megaparsec-scale densities around radio galaxies. Our findings are consistent with the view that giants are regular, rather than mechanistically special, members of the radio galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Wide Binary Evaporation by Dark Solitons: Implications from the GAIA Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytic calculation is given for binary star evaporation under the tidal perturbation from randomly distributed, spatially extended dark objects. In particular, the Milky Way's wide binary star population are susceptible to such disruption from dark matter solitons of comparable and larger sizes. We identify high-probability `halo-like' wide binaries in GAIA EDR3 with separations larger than 0.1 parsec. Survival of the farthest-separated candidates will provide a novel gravitational probe to dark matter in the form of solitons. In case of dilute axion-like solitons, the observational sensitivity is shown to extend into the axion mass range $m_a \sim 10^{-17}-10^{-15}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Tidal Spin-up of Black Hole Progenitor Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations indicate the existence of merging black holes (BHs) with high spin ($a\gtrsim0.3$), whose formation pathways are still an open question. A possible way to form those binaries is through the tidal spin-up of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by its BH companion. In this work, we investigate this scenario by directly calculating the tidal excitation of oscillation modes in WR star models, determining the tidal spin-up rate, and integrating the coupled spin-orbit evolution for WR-BH binaries. We find that for short-period orbits and massive WR stars, the tidal interaction is mostly contributed by standing gravity modes, in contrast to Zahn's model of travelling waves which is frequently assumed in the literature. The standing modes are less efficiently damped than traveling waves, meaning that prior estimates of tidal spin-up may be overestimated. We show that tidal synchronization is rarely reached in WR-BH binaries, and the resulting BH spins have $a \lesssim 0.4$ for all but the shortest period ($P_{\rm orb} \! \lesssim 0.5 \, {\rm d}$) binaries. Tidal spin-up in lower-mass systems is more efficient, providing an anti-correlation between the mass and spin of the BHs, which could be tested in future gravitational wave data. Nonlinear damping processes are poorly understood but may allow for more efficient tidal spin-up. We also discuss a new class of gravito-thermal modes that appear in our calculations.</description>

      <title>Fission and fusion of heavy nuclei induced by the passage of a radiation-mediated shock in BNS mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the structure of a Newtonian, multi-ion radiation-mediated shock (RMS) for different compositions anticipated in various stellar explosions. We use a multifluid RMS model that incorporates electrostatic coupling between the different plasma constituents as well as Coulomb friction in a self-consistent manner, and approximates the effect of pair creation and the presence of free neutrons in the shock upstream on the shock structure. We find that under certain conditions a significant velocity separation is developed between different ions in the shock downstream and demonstrate that in fast enough shocks ion-ion collisions may trigger fusion and fission events at a relatively high rate. Our analysis ignores anomalous coupling through plasma microturbulence, that might reduce the velocity spread downstream below the activation energy for nuclear reactions. A rough estimate of the scale separation in RMS suggests that for shocks propagating in BNS merger ejecta the anomalous coupling length may exceed the radiation length, allowing a considerable composition change behind the shock via inelastic collisions of $\alpha$ particles with heavy elements at shock velocities $\beta_u\gtrsim0.25$. A sufficient abundance of free neutrons in the shock upstream, as expected during the first second after the merger, is also expected to alter the ejecta composition through neutron capture downstream. The resultant change in the composition profile may affect the properties of the early kilonova emission. The generation of microturbulence due to velocity separation can also give rise to particle acceleration that might alter the breakout signal in supernovae and other systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties and detectability of the magneto-thermal instability in the intracluster medium</title>

Abstract: Context. Amongst many plasma processes potentially relevant to the dynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM), turbulence driven at observable scales by internal magnetised buoyancy instabilities like the magneto-thermal instability (MTI) stand out in the ICM outskirt, where the background temperature decreases with radius. Aims. We characterise the statistical properties of MTI turbulence and assess whether such magnetised dynamics would be detectable with the future X-ray calorimeter X-IFU onboard ATHENA. Methods. We make use of scaling laws derived by Perrone &amp; Latter (2022a,b) to estimate the observable turbulent saturation levels and injection length of MTI turbulence for different ICM thermodynamic profiles, and perform a numerical MHD simulation of the dynamics with Braginskii heat and momentum diffusion. As a prospective exercise, we use the simulation to virtually observe MTI turbulence through the X-IFU. Results. In bright enough regions amenable to X-ray observations, the MTI drives mild turbulence up to $\sim$ 5% and $\sim$ 100 km/s (rms temperature fluctuation and velocity). However, the measurable integrated temperature fluctuation and line-of-sight velocity fields, which is essentially the azimuthal velocity component in cluster haloes, hardly exceed 1% and 10 km/s respectively. We show that such moderate signals would be hard to detect with upcoming X-ray telescopes. MTI turbulence is anisotropic in the direction of the gravity. If the fluctuation intensities were to be stronger than the current theoretical estimates, MTI fluctuations may be detectable and their anisotropy discernible with the X-IFU. Conclusions. Finding direct signatures of magnetised dynamics in the ICM, even at observable scales typical of the MTI, remains challenging. This study is a first step in this direction. Several numerical and observational strategies are discussed to make further progress.</description>

      <title>Effects of Annihilation with Low-Energy Neutrinos on High-Energy Neutrinos from Binary Neutron Star Mergers and Rare Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that high-energy (HE) neutrinos produced from choked jets can be annihilated with low-energy (LE) neutrinos emitted from the accretion disk around a black hole in binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae. For HE neutrinos produced close to the stellar center ($\lesssim 10^{9}-10^{12}$ cm), we find that the emerging all-flavor spectrum for neutrinos of $E\gtrsim 0.1-1$ PeV could be modified by a factor $E^{-n}$ with $n\gtrsim 0.4-0.5$ under realistic conditions. Flavor evolution of LE neutrinos does not affect this result but can change the emerging flavor composition of HE neutrinos. As a consequence, the above annihilation effect may need to be considered for HE neutrinos produced from choked jets at small radii. We briefly discuss the annihilation effects for different HE neutrino production models and point out that such effects could be tested through precise measurements of the diffuse neutrino spectrum and flavor composition.</description>

      <title>An alternative statistical interpretation for the apparent plateaus in the duration distributions of GRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a plateau in the short-duration tail of the observed distribution of cosmological Long-soft Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) has been argued as the first direct evidence of Collapsars. A similar plateau in the short-duration tail of the observed duration distribution of Short-hard Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs) has been suggested as evidence of compact binary mergers. We present an equally plausible alternative interpretation for this evidence, which is purely statistical. Specifically, we show that the observed plateau in the short-duration tail of the duration distribution of LGRBs can naturally occur in the statistical distributions of strictly positive physical quantities, exacerbated by the effects of mixing with the duration distribution of SGRBs, observational selection effects, and data aggregation (e.g., binning) methodologies. The observed plateau in the short-duration tail of the observed distributions of SGRBs can similarly result from a combination of sample incompleteness and inhomogeneous binning of data. The observed plateau in the short-duration tail of the observed distributions of SGRBs can similarly result from a combination of sample incompleteness and inhomogeneous binning of data. We further confirm the impact of these factors on the observation of a plateau in the duration distributions of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) through extensive numerical Monte Carlo simulations. Our presented analysis corroborates and strengthens a purely statistical and sample-incompleteness interpretation of the observed plateau in the duration distribution of LGRBs and SGRBs without invoking the physics of Collapsars and jet-propagation through the stellar envelope.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Neutron Star $f-$mode Oscillations in General Relativity with Spectral Representation of Nuclear Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasinormal $f-$mode oscillations in neutron star(NS) interiors within the linearized General Relativistic formalism. We utilize approximately 9000 nuclear Equations of State (EOS) using spectral representation techniques, incorporating constraints on nuclear saturation properties, chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT) for pure neutron matter, and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) for densities pertinent to NS cores. The median values of f-mode frequency, $\nu_f$ (damping time, $\tau_f$) for NS with masses ranging from 1.4 - 2.0 $M_\odot$ lie between 1.80 - 2.20 kHz (0.13 - 0.22 s) for our entire EOS set. Our study reveals a weak correlation between $f-$mode frequencies and individual nuclear saturation properties, prompting the necessity for more intricate methodologies to unveil multi-parameter relationships. We observe a robust linear relationship between the radii and $f-$mode frequencies for different NS masses. Leveraging this correlation alongside NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, we establish constraints that exhibit partial and minimal overlap for observational data from Riley et al. and Miller et al. respectively with our nucleonic EOS dataset. Moreover, NICER data aligns closely with radius and frequency values for a few hadron-quark hybrid EOS models. This indicates the need to consider additional exotic particles such as deconfined quarks at suprasaturation densities. We conclude that future observations of the radius or $f-$mode frequency for more than one NS mass, particularly at the extremes of viable NS mass scale, would either rule out nucleon-only EOS or provide definitive evidence in its favour.</description>

      <title>Fast as Potoroo: Radio Continuum Detection of a Bow-Shock Pulsar Wind Nebula Powered by Pulsar J1638-4713</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (PWN), named Potoroo, and the detection of a young pulsar J1638-4713 that powers the nebula. We present a radio continuum study of the PWN based on 20-cm observations obtained from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and MeerKAT. PSR J1638-4713 was identified using Parkes radio telescope observations at frequencies above 3 GHz. The pulsar has the second-highest dispersion measure of all known radio pulsars (1553 pc/cm^3), a spin period of 65.74 ms and a spin-down luminosity of 6.1x10^36 erg/s. The PWN has a cometary morphology and one of the greatest projected lengths among all the observed pulsar radio tails, measuring over 21 pc for an assumed distance of 10 kpc. The remarkably long tail and atypically steep radio spectral index are attributed to the interplay of a supernova reverse shock and the PWN. The originating supernova remnant is not known so far. We estimated the pulsar kick velocity to be in the range of 1000-2000 km/s for ages between 23 and 10 kyr. The X-ray counterpart found in Chandra data, CXOU J163802.6-471358, shows the same tail morphology as the radio source but is shorter by a factor of 10. The peak of the X-ray emission is offset from the peak of the radio total intensity (Stokes I) emission by approximately 4.7", but coincides well with circularly polarised (Stokes V) emission. No infrared counterpart was found.</description>

      <title>Polarized QED Cascades over Pulsar Polar Caps</title>

Abstract: The formation of $e^\pm$ plasmas within pulsar magnetospheres through quantum electrodynamics (QED) cascades in vacuum gaps is widely acknowledged. This paper aims to investigate the effect of photon polarization during the QED cascade occurring over the polar cap of a pulsar. We employ a Monte Carlo-based QED algorithm that accurately accounts for both spin and polarization effects during photon emission and pair production in both single-particle and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Our findings reveal distinctive properties in the photon polarization of curvature radiation (CR) and synchrotron radiation (SR). CR photons exhibit high linear polarization parallel to the plane of the curved magnetic field lines, whereas SR photons, on average, demonstrate weak polarization. As the QED cascade progresses, SR photons gradually dominate over CR photons, thus reducing the average degree of photon polarization. Additionally, our study highlights an intriguing observation: the polarization of CR photons enhances $e^\pm$ pair production by approximately 5%, in contrast to the inhibition observed in laser-plasma interactions. Our self-consistent QED PIC simulations in the corotating frame reproduce the essential results obtained from single-particle simulations.</description>

      <title>The Effects of $r$-Process Enrichment in Hydrogen-Rich Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae are candidate sites for the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). We explore the effects of enrichment from $r$-process nuclei on the light-curves of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe IIP) and assess the detectability of these signatures. We modify the radiation transport code $\texttt{SNEC}$ to include the approximate effects of opacity and radioactive heating from $r$-process elements in the SN ejecta. We present models spanning a range of total $r$-process masses $M_{\rm r}$ and their assumed radial distribution within the ejecta, finding that $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$ is sufficient to induce appreciable differences in their light-curves as compared to ordinary SNe IIP (without any $r$-process elements). The primary photometric signatures of $r$-process enrichment include a shortening of the plateau phase, coinciding with the hydrogen-recombination photosphere retreating to the $r$-process-enriched layers, and a steeper post-plateau decline associated with a reddening of the SN colors. We compare our $r$-process-enriched models to ordinary IIP models and observational data, showing that yields of $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$ are potentially detectable across several of the metrics used by transient observers, provided that the $r$-process rich layers are mixed $\gtrsim$ halfway to the ejecta surface. This detectability threshold can roughly be reproduced analytically using a two-zone ("kilonova within a supernova") picture. Assuming that a small fraction of SNe produce a detectable $r$-process yield $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2}M_\odot$, and respecting constraints on the total Galactic production rate, we estimate that $\gtrsim 10^{3}-10^4$ SNe need be observed to find one $r$-enriched event, a feat that may become possible with the Vera Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>On the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars by studying the population of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach accounts for the measurement uncertainties of individual observations and selection effects. Without correcting for selection effects, as done in previous studies, we find that pulsar initial spin periods follow a Weibull distribution, peaking at 40~ms, which is favoured against the log-normal distribution with a Bayes factor of 200. The known selection effects in radio pulsar surveys, including pulse broadening and a period-dependent beaming fraction, have been quantitatively investigated. We show that, based on measurements of pulsar luminosity and spin period from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue, the impact of pulse broadening on the inference of pulsar period distribution is likely to be insignificant. Correcting for the beaming selection effect, a Weibull distribution remains to be the preferred model, while its peak slightly shifts to longer periods at 50~ms. Our method will prove useful in constraining the birth properties of neutron stars in the Square Kilometre Array era.</description>

      <title>Outlook for detecting the gravitational wave displacement and spin memory effects with current and future gravitational wave detectors</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave memory effects arise from non-oscillatory components of gravitational wave signals, and they are predictions of general relativity in the nonlinear regime that have close connections to the asymptotic properties of isolated gravitating systems. There are many types of memory effects that have been studied in the literature. In this paper we focus on the "displacement" and "spin" memories, which are expected to be the largest of these effects from sources such as the binary black hole mergers which have already been detected by LIGO and Virgo. The displacement memory is a change in the relative separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of gravitational waves, whereas the spin memory is a portion of the change in relative separation of observers with initial relative velocity. As both of these effects are small, LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA can only detect memory effects from individual events that are much louder (and thus rarer) than those that have been detected so far. By combining data from multiple events, however, these effects could be detected in a population of binary mergers. In this paper, we present new forecasts for how long current and future detectors will need to operate in order to measure these effects from populations of binary black hole systems that are consistent with the populations inferred from the detections from LIGO and Virgo's first three observing runs. We find that a second-generation detector network of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA operating at the O4 ("design") sensitivity for 1.5 years and then operating at the O5 ("plus") sensitivity for an additional year can detect the displacement memory. For Cosmic Explorer, we find that displacement memory could be detected for individual loud events, and that the spin memory could be detected in a population within 2 years of observation time.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling with lepton-flavor-violating axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cores of dense stars are a powerful laboratory for studying feebly coupled particles such as axions. Some of the strongest constraints on axionlike particles and their couplings to ordinary matter derive from considerations of stellar axion emission. In this work we study the radiation of axionlike particles from degenerate neutron star matter via a lepton-flavor-violating coupling that leads to muon-electron conversion when an axion is emitted. We calculate the axion emission rate per unit volume (emissivity) and by comparing with the rate of neutrino emission, we infer upper limits on the lepton-flavor-violating coupling that are at the level of $|g_{ae\mu}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$. For the hotter environment of a supernova, such as SN 1987A, the axion emission rate is enhanced and the limit is stronger, at the level of $|g_{ae\mu}| \lesssim 10^{-11}$, competitive with laboratory limits. Interestingly, our derivation of the axion emissivity reveals that axion emission via the lepton-flavor-violating coupling is suppressed relative to the familiar lepton-flavor-preserving channels by the square of the plasma temperature to muon mass ratio, which is responsible for the relatively weaker limits.</description>

      <title>Differencing and Coadding JWST Images with Matched Point Spread Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to derive difference images for data taken with the JWST with matched point-spread functions (PSFs). It is based on the saccadic fast Fourier transform (SFFT) method but with revisions to accommodate the rotations and spatial variations of the PSFs. It allows for spatially varying kernels in B-spline form with separately controlled photometric scaling and Tikhonov kernel regularization for harnessing the ultimate fitting flexibility. We present this method using the JWST/NIRCam images of galaxy cluster Abell 2744 acquired in JWST Cycle 1 as the test data. The algorithm can be useful for time-domain source detection and differential photometry with the JWST. It can also coadd images of multiple exposures taken at different field orientations. The coadded images preserve the sharpness of the central cores of the PSFs, and the positions and shapes of the objects are matched precisely with B-splines across the field.</description>

      <title>Cost of inferred nuclear parameters towards the f-mode dynamical tide in binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) observations from Neutron Stars (NS) in a binary system provide an excellent scenario to constrain the nuclear parameters. The investigation of Pratten et al. (2022) has shown that the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tidal correction in the GW waveform model of the binary neutron star (BNS) system can lead to substantial bias in the measurement of NS properties and NS equations of state (EOS). In this work, we investigate the bias in the nuclear parameters resulting from the ignorance of dynamical tidal correction. In addition, this work demonstrates the sensitivity of the nuclear parameters and the estimated constraints on them from future GW observations. We infer the nuclear parameters from GW observations by describing the NS matter within the relativistic mean field model. For a population of GW events, we notice that the ignorance of dynamical tide predicts a lower median for nucleon effective mass ($m^*$) by $\sim6\%$ compared to the scenario when dynamical tidal correction is considered. Whereas at a 90\% credible interval(CI), $m^*$ gets constrained up to $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 3\%$ in A+ (the LIGO-Virgo detectors with a sensitivity of 5th observing run) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively. We also discuss the resulting constraints on all other nuclear parameters, including compressibility, symmetry energy, and slope of symmetry energy, considering an ensemble of GW events. We do not notice any significant impact in analyzing nuclear parameters other than $m^*$ due to the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tides.</description>

      <title>SKA Sensitivity to Sub-GeV Dark Matter Decay: Synchrotron Radio Emissions in White Dwarf Magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in detecting synchrotron radiation emitted from the decay of sub-GeV dark matter (dark matter with masses below the GeV scale) in the presence of strong magnetic fields. As a concrete setup, we consider scenarios where the magnetosphere of a magnetic white dwarf overlaps with dense dark matter environments, such as those surrounding a primordial black hole. Our study reveals that the encounters of compact objects such as white dwarfs and black holes offer a promising avenue for upcoming radio telescopes to probe the properties of light dark matter, which has been less explored compared with more conventional heavier (masses above the GeV scale) dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Brans-Dicke gravity from neutron star-black hole merger events using higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a 90\% credible lower bound on the modified parameter of scalar-tensor theories as $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.94\times10^{-4}$ by using dominant-mode correction. Specific to BD theory, we have the constraint $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;4.75$. Asymmetric binary systems usually have a significant mass ratio; in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor theories and provides a tighter constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.59\times10^{-4}$. Transitioning to the BD theory, the constraint is $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;5.06$, with a 6.5\% improvement. We also consider a plausible NSBH event, GW190814, which is a highly unequal mass ratio source and exhibits strong evidence for higher-order multipoles. We obtain poorly converged results when using the dominant mode while getting a constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-6.60\times10^{-4}$ on scalar-tensor theories when including the higher harmonic modes. This suggests that the difference between the dominant mode and higher modes has a significant impact on our analysis. Furthermore, treating this suspected event as an NSBH event, we find $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;6.12$ when including the higher harmonic modes. Combining GW200115 and GW190814 and including higher modes, the constraint is improved to $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;110.55$. This is currently the strongest constraint utilizing GWs, contingent upon GW190814 being an NSBH event. Additionally, we take into account a BD-like theory, known as screened modified gravity (SMG), and investigate the coupling constant constraints, both with and without higher-mode corrections, by using data from both GW200115 and GW190814.</description>

      <title>The Hot Circum-Galactic Medium in the eROSITA All Sky Survey I. X-ray Surface Brightness Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a stacking technique to gain enough statistics to detect the hot CGM around galaxies. We use the X-ray data from the first four SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS:4). We discuss how the satellite galaxies could bias the stacking and carefully build the central galaxy samples based on the SDSS spectroscopic survey and halo-based group finder algorithm and isolated galaxy sample from the ninth data release of the DESI Legacy survey (LS DR9, photometric). We mask the detected X-ray point sources and carefully model the X-ray emission from the unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB) to obtain the X-ray emission from the hot CGM. The X-ray surface brightness profiles are measured for $\log(M_*)&gt;10.0$ or $\log(M_{\rm 200m})&gt;11.5$ central galaxies, and $\log(M_*)&gt;9.5$ isolated galaxies. We detect the X-ray emission around MW-mass ($\log(M_*)=10.5-11.0$) and more massive central galaxies extending up to the virial radius ($R_{\rm vir}$). The signal-to-noise ratio of the extended emission around the MW-mass galaxy is about $8.1\sigma$ within $R_{\rm vir}$. We use the $\beta$ model to describe the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the hot CGM. We obtain a central surface brightness of $S_{\rm X,0}\approx 3.1\times10^{35}\rm erg/s/kpc^2$ and $\beta \approx0.42$ for MW-mass galaxy. We estimate the baryon budget of the hot CGM and obtain a value lower than the $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology predicted. Our results set a firm footing for the presence of a hot CGM around MW-mass and more massive central galaxies. These measurements constitute a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and possible implementations of feedback processes therein.</description>

      <title>The Hot Circum-Galactic Medium in the eROSITA All Sky Survey II. Scaling Relations between X-ray Luminosity and Galaxies' Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the hot circum-galactic medium (CGM) properties relate to the galaxy's properties can constrain galaxy evolution models. We aim to measure the scaling relations between the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM and the fundamental properties of a galaxy, i.e., its stellar mass and halo mass. We calculate the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM based on the surface brightness profiles of central galaxy samples measured in Zhang et al. (2024a, submitted) from Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA all-sky survey data. We relate the X-ray luminosity to the galaxies' stellar and halo mass. We compare the observed relations to the TNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. The hot CGM X-ray luminosity correlates with the galaxy's stellar mass ($M_*$). It increases from $2.1 \pm 1.3\times10^{39} \rm erg/s$ to $2.0 \pm 0.1\times10^{41} \rm erg/s$, when $\log(M_*)$ increases from 10.0 to 11.5. A double power law describes the correlation, with a break at $\log(M_*)=11.28\pm 0.03$ and a power-law index or $1.9\pm 0.2$ ($4.2\pm0.1$) below (above) the break. The hot CGM X-ray luminosity as a function of halo mass is measured within $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3-13.7$, extending our knowledge of the scaling relation by more than two orders of magnitude. $L_{\rm X,CGM}$ increases with $M_{\rm 500c}$ from $2.7 \pm 0.9\times10^{39}\ \rm erg/s$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3$ to $9.2 \pm 0.4\times10^{41}\ \rm erg/s$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=13.7$. The relation follows a power law of $\log(L_{\rm X,CGM})= (1.35\pm 0.04)\times \log(M_{\rm 500c})+(23.8\pm0.5)$. We find a general agreement between simulations and observation. We explore, at the low mass end, the average scaling relations between the CGM X-ray luminosity and the galaxy's stellar mass or halo mass, which constitutes a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and feedback processes.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating as a discriminator for horizons in equatorial eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal heating in a binary black hole system is driven by the absorption of energy and angular momentum by the black hole's horizon. Previous works have shown that this phenomenon becomes particularly significant during the late stages of an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) into a rapidly spinning massive black hole, a key focus for future low-frequency gravitational-wave observations by (for instance) the LISA mission. Past analyses have largely focused on quasi-circular inspiral geometry, with some of the most detailed studies looking at equatorial cases. Though useful for illustrating the physical principles, this limit is not very realistic astrophysically, since the population of EMRI events is expected to arise from compact objects scattered onto relativistic orbits in galactic centers through many-body events. In this work, we extend those results by studying the importance of tidal heating in equatorial EMRIs with generic eccentricities. Our results suggest that accurate modeling of tidal heating is crucial to prevent significant dephasing and systematic errors in EMRI parameter estimation. We examine a phenomenological model for EMRIs around exotic compact objects by parameterizing deviations from the black hole picture in terms of the fraction of radiation absorbed compared to the BH case. Based on a mismatch calculation we find that reflectivities as small as $|\mathcal{R}|^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ are distinguishable from the BH case, irrespective of the value of the eccentricity. We stress, however, that this finding should be corroborated by future parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian Processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>
