      <title>Group cosets with all elements of equal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $N$ a proper, nontrivial, normal subgroup of $G$. If, for every element $x$ of $G$ not lying in $N$, the elements in the coset $xN$ all have the same order as $x$, then we say that $(G,N)$ is an {\it{equal order pair}}. This generalizes the concept of a Camina pair, that was introduced by the first author. In the present paper we study several properties of equal order pairs, showing that in many respects they resemble Camina pairs, but with some important differences.</description>

      <title>Hyperlinearity via amenable near representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the amenability of unitary representations (in the sense of Bekka) via the existence of an orthonormal basis supporting an invariant probability charge. Based on this, we explore several natural notions of amenable near representations on Hilbert spaces. Establishing an analogue of a theorem about sofic groups by Elek and Szab\'o, we prove that a group is hyperlinear if and only if it admits an essentially free amenable near representation. This answers a question raised by Pestov and Kwiatkowska. For comparison, we also provide characterizations of Kirchberg's factorization property, as well as Haagerup's property, along similar lines.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Obstructions for Self-Similar Groups Generating Free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present obstruction results for self-similar groups regarding the generation of free groups. As a main consequence of our main results, we solve an open problem posed by Grigorchuk by showing that in an automaton group where a co-accessible state acts as the identity, any self-similar subgroup acting transitively on the first level, or any subgroup acting level-transitively on the rooted tree, is either cyclic or non-free. This result partially extends Sidki's findings for automaton groups with polynomial activity. Additionally, we show that for a reversible automaton group to generate a free group, the dual must necessarily contain a bireversible connected component.</description>

      <title>Encryption scheme based on Automorphism Group of Hermitian Function Field with Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a comprehensive approach to implementing encryption schemes based on the automorphism group of the Hermitian function field. We utilize a three-parameter group with logarithmic representations outside the group's center. In this work, we enhance the Hermitian function field-based encryption scheme with homomorphic encryption capabilities, which constitutes a significant advantage of our implementation. Both the attack complexity and the encrypted message size are directly correlated with the order of the group.</description>

      <title>Improved MST3 Encryption scheme based on small Ree groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an encryption scheme based on the small Ree groups. We propose utilizing the small Ree group structure to enhance the overall security parameters of the encryption scheme. By extending the logarithmic signature to encompass the entire group and modifying the encryption algorithm, we have developed robust protection against sequential key recovery attacks.</description>

      <title>On Rigid Varieties Isogenous to a Product of Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study rigid complex manifolds that are realized as quotients of a product of curves by a free action of a finite group. They serve as higher-dimensional analogues of Beauville surfaces. Using uniformization, we outline the theory to characterize these manifolds through specific combinatorial data associated with the group under the assumption that the action is diagonal and the manifold is of general type. This leads to the notion of a $n$-fold Beauville structure. We define an action on the set of all $n$-fold Beauville structures of a given finite group that allows us to distinguish the biholomorphism classes of the underlying rigid manifolds. As an application, we give a classification of these manifolds with group $\mathbb Z_5^2$ in the three dimensional case and prove that this is the smallest possible group that allows a rigid, free and diagonal action on a product of three curves. In addition, we provide the classification of rigid 3-folds $X$ given by a group acting faithfully on each factor for any value of the holomorphic Euler number $\chi(\mathcal O_X) \geq -5$.</description>

      <title>The Higman-M\lowercase{c}Laughlin Theorem for the flag-transitive $2$-designs with $\lambda$ prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A famous result of Higman and McLaughlin \cite{HM} in 1961 asserts that any flag-transitive automorphism group $G$ of a $2$-design $\mathcal{D}$ with $\lambda=1$ acts point-primitively on $\mathcal{D}$. In this paper, we show that the Higman and McLaughlin theorem is still true when $\lambda$ is a prime and $\mathcal{D}$ is not isomorphic to one of the two $2$-$(16,6,2)$ designs as in [42, Section 1.2], or the $2$-$(45,12,3)$ design as in [44, Construction 4.2], or, when $2^{2^{j}}+1$ is a Fermat prime, a possible $2$-$(2^{2^{j+1}}(2^{2^{j}}+2),2^{2^{j}}(2^{2^{j}}+1),2^{2^{j}}+1)$ design having very specific features.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial isoperimetric inequality for the free factor complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the free factor complex of the free group of rank greater than or equal to 4 does not satisfy a combinatorial isoperimetric inequality: that is, for every natural number N, there is a loop c_N of length 4 in the free factor complex such that the number of 2-simplices required to fill c_N grows at least as a linear function of N. To prove the result, we construct a coarsely Lipschitz function from the `upward link' of a free factor to the set of integers.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>

      <title>Boone-Higman embeddings of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ and mapping class groups of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the groups $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ satisfy the Boone-Higman conjecture for all $n$, meaning each $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ embeds in a finitely presented simple group. In fact, we prove that each $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ satisfies the "permutational" Boone-Higman conjecture, which means the simple group in question can be taken to be a twisted Brin-Thompson group. A far-reaching consequence of our approach is that finitely presented twisted Brin-Thompson groups are universal among finitely presented simple groups that are highly transitive. This is evidence toward the Boone-Higman conjecture being equivalent to its permutational version. Proving the conjecture for $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ also confirms the conjecture for all groups (virtually) embedding into some $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$, such as mapping class groups of non-closed surfaces, braid groups, loop braid groups, ribbon braid groups and certain Artin groups. This answers several questions of the first and fourth authors with Bleak and Matucci. Yet another consequence of our approach is that satisfying the permutational Boone-Higman conjecture is closed under free products.</description>

      <title>$5 \times 5$-graded Lie algebras, cubic norm structures and quadrangular algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simple Lie algebras generated by extremal elements, over arbitrary fields of arbitrary characteristic. We show: (1) If the extremal geometry contains lines, then the Lie algebra admits a $5 \times 5$-grading that can be parametrized by a cubic norm structure; (2) If there exists a field extension of degree at most $2$ such that the extremal geometry over that field extension contains lines, and in addition, there exist symplectic pairs of extremal elements, then the Lie algebra admits a $5 \times 5$-grading that can be parametrized by a quadrangular algebra.
  One of our key tools is a new definition of exponential maps that makes sense even over fields of characteristic $2$ and $3$, which ought to be interesting in its own right.</description>
