      <title>A Localized Reality Appears To Underpin Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although entangled state vectors cannot be described in terms of classically realistic variables, localized in space and time, any given entanglement experiment can be built from basic quantum circuit components with well-defined locations. By analyzing the (local) weak values for any given run of a quantum circuit, we present evidence for a localized account of any circuit's behavior. Specifically, even if the state is massively entangled, the weak values are found to evolve only when they pass through a local circuit element. They otherwise remain constant and do not evolve when other qubits pass through their circuit elements. A further surprise is found when two qubits are brought together in an exchange interaction, as their weak values then evolve according to a simple classical equation. The weak values are subject to both past and future constraints, so they can only be determined by considering the entire circuit "all-at-once", as in action principles. In the context of a few basic quantum gates, we show how an all-at-once model of a complete circuit could generate weak values without using state vectors as an intermediate step. Since these gates comprise a universal quantum gate set, this lends support to the claim that any quantum circuit can plausibly be underpinned by localized variables, providing a realistic, lower-level account of generic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Consciousness-Centered Ontology of Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), a paradigm that re-envisions quantum theory and its interplay with spacetime, observers, and consciousness. Abandoning the notion of a preexisting universe or fixed manifold, RQD posits that observers, observed systems, and geometric structures emerge together as stable relational patterns in an underlying quantum substrate. Spacetime is thus recast as an effective, large-scale feature of entanglement and information flows rather than a fundamental stage. By eliminating pre-given observers and absolute properties, RQD unifies relational quantum mechanics, insights from holography and tensor networks, and non-dual philosophical traditions into a single idealist framework. Here, universal awareness is not an added element but the ontological ground, ensuring that subjective experience and physical reality co-derive from the same relational field. This approach not only demystifies the "hard problem" of consciousness, making it intrinsic rather than emergent but also resolves longstanding quantum puzzles, such as Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios, by showing that no absolute vantage point or objective collapse is required. In harmonizing quantum theory, emergent geometry, and a fundamental awareness-based ontology, RQD reveals that quantum mechanics, gravity, and consciousness are facets of a single, integrated reality.</description>

      <title>Indigenous knowledges and kinship as a model for our future in outer space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial endeavours have already compromised our relationship with space. The Artemis Accords are creating a framework that will commercialize the Moon and further impact that relation. To confront that impact, a number of organizations have begun to develop new principles of sustainability in space, many of which are borne out of the capitalist and colonial frameworks that have harmed water, nature, peoples and more on Earth. Indigenous methodologies and ways of knowing offer different paths for living in relationship with space and the Moon. While Indigenous knowledges are not homogeneous, there are lessons we can use from some of common methods. In this talk we will review some Indigenous methodologies, including the concept of kinship and discuss how kinship can inform our actions both on Earth and in space.</description>

      <title>The Dual Dynamical Foundation of Orthodox Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper combines mathematical, philosophical, and historical analyses in a comprehensive investigation of the dynamical foundations of the formalism of orthodox quantum mechanics. The results obtained include: (i) A deduction of the canonical commutation relations (CCR) from the tenets of Matrix Mechanics; (ii) A discussion of the meaning of Schr\"odinger's first derivation of the wave equation that not only improves on Joas and Lehner's 2009 investigation on the subject but also demonstrates that the CCR follow of necessity from Schr\"odinger's first derivation of the wave equation, thus correcting the common misconception that the CCR were only posited by Schr\"odinger to pursue equivalence with Matrix Mechanics; (iii) A discussion of the mathematical facts and requirements involved in the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics that improves on F. A. Muller's classical treatment of the subject; (iv) A proof that the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics is necessitated by the formal requirements of a dual action functional from which both the dynamical postulates of orthodox quantum mechanics, von Neumann's process 1 and process 2, follow; (v) A critical assessment, based on (iii) and (iv), of von Neumann's construction of unified quantum mechanics over Hilbert space. Point (iv) is our main result. It brings to the open the important, but hitherto ignored, fact that orthodox quantum mechanics is no exception to the golden rule of physics that the dynamics of a physical theory must follow from the action functional. If orthodox quantum mechanics, based as it is on the assumption of the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics, has this "peculiar dual dynamics," as von Neumann called it, this is so because by assuming the equivalence one has been assuming a peculiar dual action.</description>
