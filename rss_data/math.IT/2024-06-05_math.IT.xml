      <title>Reverse PAC Codes: Look-ahead List Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional precoding in polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes is a recently introduced variant of polar codes. It has demonstrated an effective reduction in the number of minimum weight codewords (a.k.a error coefficient) of polar codes. This reduction has the potential to significantly improve the error correction performance. From a codeword formation perspective, this reduction has limitations. Capitalizing on the understanding of the decomposition of minimum-weight codewords, this paper studies reverse precoding that can effectively reduce minimum-weight codewords more than in PAC codes. We propose a look-ahead list decoding for the reverse PAC codes, which has the same order of complexity as list decoding in PAC codes. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate a notable reduction in error coefficients compared to PAC codes and polar codes, resulting in a remarkable improvement in the block error rate, in particular at high code rates.</description>

      <title>A Novel Paradigm Shift for Next-Generation: Symbiotic Backscatter Rate-Splitting Multiple Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are projected to empower a broad range of Internet-of-things (IoT) applications and services with extreme data rates, posing new challenges in delivering large-scale connectivity at a low cost to current communication paradigms. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is one of the most spotlight nominees, conceived to address spectrum scarcity while reaching massive connectivity. Meanwhile, symbiotic communication is said to be an inexpensive way to realize future IoT on a large scale. To reach the goal of spectrum efficiency improvement and low energy consumption, we merge these advances by means of introducing a novel paradigm shift, called symbiotic backscatter RSMA, for the next generation. Specifically, we first establish the way to operate the symbiotic system to assist the readers in apprehending the proposed paradigm, then guide detailed design in beamforming weights with four potential gain-control (GC) strategies for enhancing symbiotic communication, and finally provide an information-theoretic framework using a new metric, called symbiotic outage probability (SOP) to characterize the proposed system performance. Through numerical result experiments, we show that the developed framework can accurately predict the actual SOP and the efficacy of the proposed GC strategies in improving the SOP performance.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis and Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Extended Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station transmits beamformed signals for joint downlink multi-user communication and radar sensing of an extended target (ET). By considering echo signals as reflections from valid elements on the ET contour, a set of novel Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) is derived for parameter estimation of the ET, including central range, direction, and orientation. The ISAC transmit beamforming design is then formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to minimize the CRB associated with radar sensing, while satisfying a minimum signal-to-interference-pulse-noise ratio requirement for each communication user, along with a 3-dB beam coverage constraint tailored for the ET. To solve this non-convex problem, we utilize semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and propose a rank-one solution extraction scheme for non-tight relaxation circumstances. To reduce the computation complexity, we further employ an efficient zero-forcing (ZF) based beamforming design, where the sensing task is performed in the null space of communication channels. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the obtained CRB, revealing the diverse features of CRB for differently shaped ETs. The proposed SDR beamforming design outperforms benchmark designs with lower estimation error and CRB, while the ZF beamforming design greatly improves computation efficiency with minor sensing performance loss.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Common Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new notion $R_\ell$ of higher-order common information, which quantifies the information that $\ell\geq 2$ arbitrarily distributed random variables have in common. We provide analytical lower bounds on $R_3$ and $R_4$ for jointly Gaussian distributed sources and provide computable lower bounds for $R_\ell$ for any $\ell$ and any sources. We also provide a practical method to estimate the lower bounds on, e.g., real-world time-series data. As an example, we consider EEG data acquired in a setup with competing acoustic stimuli. We demonstrate that $R_3$ has descriptive properties that is not in $R_2$. Moreover, we observe a linear relationship between the amount of common information $R_3$ communicated from the acoustic stimuli and to the brain and the corresponding cortical activity in terms of neural tracking of the envelopes of the stimuli.</description>

      <title>Improved Generalized Automorphism Belief Propagation Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demands on future wireless systems, new design objectives become eminent. Low-density parity-check codes together with belief propagation (BP) decoding have outstanding performance for large block lengths. Yet, for future wireless systems, good decoding performance for short block lengths is mandatory, a regime in which BP decoding typically shows a significant gap to maximum likelihood decoding. Automorphism ensemble decoding (AED) is known to reduce this gap effectively and, in addition, enables an easy trade-off between latency, throughput, and complexity. Recently, generalized AED (GAED) was proposed to increase the set of feasible automorphisms suitable for ensemble decoding. By construction, GAED requires a preprocessing step within its constituent paths that results in information loss and potentially limits the gains of GAED. In this work, we show that the preprocessing step can be merged with the Tanner graph of BP decoding, thereby improving the performance of the constituent paths. Finally, we show that the improvement of the individual paths also enhances the overall performance of the ensemble.</description>

      <title>On the largest minimum distances of [n,6] LCD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes can be used to against side-channel attacks and fault noninvasive attacks. Let $d_{a}(n,6)$ and $d_{l}(n,6)$ be the minimum weights of all binary optimal linear codes and LCD codes with length $n$ and dimension 6, respectively.In this article, we aim to obtain the values of $d_{l}(n,6)$ for $n\geq 51$ by investigating the nonexistence and constructions of LCD codes with given parameters. Suppose that $s \ge 0$ and $0\leq t\leq 62$ are two integers and $n=63s+t$. Using the theories of defining vectors, generalized anti-codes, reduced codes and nested codes, we exactly determine $d_{l}(n,6)$ for $t \notin\{21,22,25,26,33,34,37,38,45,46\}$, while we show that $d_{l}(n,6)\in$$\{d_{a}(n,6)$ $-1,d_{a}(n,6)\}$ for $t\in\{21,22,26,34,37,38,46\}$ and $ d_{l}(n,6)\in$$ \{d_{a}(n,6)-2,$ $d_{a}(n,6)-1\}$ for$t\in{25,33,45\}$.</description>

      <title>Sparse Recovery for Holographic MIMO Channels: Leveraging the Clustered Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envisioned as the next-generation transceiver technology, the holographic multiple-input-multiple-output (HMIMO) garners attention for its superior capabilities of fabricating electromagnetic (EM) waves. However, the densely packed antenna elements significantly increase the dimension of the HMIMO channel matrix, rendering traditional channel estimation methods inefficient. While the dimension curse can be relieved to avoid the proportional increase with the antenna density using the state-of-the-art wavenumber-domain sparse representation, the sparse recovery complexity remains tied to the order of non-zero elements in the sparse channel, which still considerably exceeds the number of scatterers. By modeling the inherent clustered sparsity using a Gaussian mixed model (GMM)-based von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, the to-be-estimated channel characteristics can be compressed to the scatterer level. Upon the sparsity extraction, a novel wavenumber-domain expectation-maximization (WD-EM) algorithm is proposed to implement the cluster-by-cluster variational inference, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity. Simulation results verify the robustness of the proposed scheme across overheads and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>MIMO Capacity Maximization with Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) link assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS). We maximize the capacity by alternately optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, and the BD-RIS scattering matrix, which, according to network theory, should be unitary and symmetric. These constraints make the optimization of BD-RIS more challenging than that of diagonal RIS. To find a stationary point of the capacity we maximize a sequence of quadratic problems in the manifold of unitary matrices. This leads to an efficient algorithm that always improves the capacity obtained by a diagonal RIS. Through simulation examples, we study the capacity improvement provided by a passive BD-RIS architecture over the conventional RIS model in which the phase shift matrix is diagonal.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of Reed-Solomon Codes and Random Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the list-decodability and list-recoverability of two code ensembles: random linear codes and random Reed-Solomon codes. Inspired by the existing research about local properties of random code ensembles over small alphabets, we develop a new framework to study a similar family of properties over larger alphabets, such as in the case of Reed-Solomon codes. We introduce the notion of local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, which encompasses various natural properties including list-decodability and list-recoverability.
  Our main contributions are twofold: (1) we establish a threshold theorem for LCL properties of random linear codes, identifying a critical rate below which these codes almost surely satisfy a given property and above which they almost surely do not; and (2) we demonstrate a reduction from random linear codes to random Reed-Solomon codes, showing that Reed-Solomon codes inherit the LCL properties of linear codes with similar rates.
  Our results imply that conjectures about the list-recoverability of random linear codes can be extended to random Reed-Solomon codes, potentially up to optimal bounds. Additionally, they provide a potential avenue to prove these list-recovery conjectures for random linear codes. Furthermore, our approach provides a more elementary proof of recent theorems on list-decodability for both random linear codes and random Reed-Solomon codes, avoiding reliance on complex external results.</description>

      <title>Doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from direct exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state relative to any product state. In this work, we establish several properties of this type of Renyi mutual information, including its additivity for $\alpha\in [1/2,2]$. As an application, we show that the direct exponent of certain binary quantum state discrimination problems is determined by the doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$. This provides an operational interpretation of this type of Renyi mutual information, and generalizes a previous result for classical probability distributions to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Hybrid Cellular and Cell-free MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free wireless communication is envisioned as one of the most promising network architectures, which can achieve stable and uniform communication performance while improving the system energy and spectrum efficiency. The deployment of cell-free networks is envisioned to be a longterm evolutionary process, in which cell-free access points (APs) will be gradually introduced into the communication network and collaborate with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). To further explore the performance limits of hybrid cellular and cell-free networks, this paper develops a hybrid network model based on stochastic geometric toolkits, which reveals the coupling of the signal and interference from both the cellular and cell-free networks. Specifically, the conjugate beamforming is applied in hybrid cellular and cell-free networks, which enables user equipment (UE) to benefit from both cellular BSs and cell-free APs. The aggregate signal received from the hybrid network is approximated via moment matching, and coverage probability is characterized by deriving the Laplace transform of the interference. The analysis of signal strength and coverage probability is verified by extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Kernel vs. Kernel: Exploring How the Data Structure Affects Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a vast amount of literature has focused on the "Neural Collapse" (NC) phenomenon, which emerges when training neural network (NN) classifiers beyond the zero training error point. The core component of NC is the decrease in the within class variability of the network's deepest features, dubbed as NC1. The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. In this paper, we provide a kernel-based analysis that does not suffer from this limitation. First, given a kernel function, we establish expressions for the traces of the within- and between-class covariance matrices of the samples' features (and consequently an NC1 metric). Then, we turn to focus on kernels associated with shallow NNs. First, we consider the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP), associated with the network at initialization, and the complement Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with its training in the "lazy regime". Interestingly, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for prototypical data models. As NC emerges from training, we then consider an alternative to NTK: the recently proposed adaptive kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model the feature mapping learned from the training data. Contrasting our NC1 analysis for these two kernels enables gaining insights into the effect of data distribution on the extent of collapse, which are empirically aligned with the behavior observed with practical training of NNs.</description>

      <title>Support Recovery of Periodic Mixtures with Nested Periodic Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic signals composed of periodic mixtures admit sparse representations in nested periodic dictionaries (NPDs). Therefore, their underlying hidden periods can be estimated by recovering the exact support of said representations. In this paper, support recovery guarantees of such signals are derived both in noise-free and noisy settings. While exact recovery conditions have been studied in the theory of compressive sensing, existing conditions fall short of yielding meaningful achievability regions in the context of periodic signals with sparse representations in NPDs, in part since existing bounds do not capture structures intrinsic to these dictionaries. We leverage known properties of NPDs to derive several conditions for exact sparse recovery of periodic mixtures in the noise-free setting. These conditions rest on newly introduced notions of nested periodic coherence and restricted coherence, which can be efficiently computed. In the presence of noise, we obtain improved conditions for recovering the exact support set of the sparse representation of the periodic mixture via orthogonal matching pursuit based on the introduced notions of coherence. The theoretical findings are corroborated using numerical experiments for different families of NPDs. Our results show significant improvement over generic recovery bounds as the conditions hold over a larger range of sparsity levels.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access with Hybrid ARQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has attracted a lot of attention as a general and powerful multiple access scheme. In the uplink, instead of encoding the whole message into one stream, a user can split its message into two parts and encode them into two streams before transmitting a superposition of these two streams. The base station (BS) uses successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode the streams and reconstruct the original messages. Focusing on the packet transmission reliability, we investigate the features of RSMA in the context of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), a well-established mechanism for enhancing reliability. This work proposes a HARQ scheme for uplink RSMA with different retransmission times for a two-user scenario and introduces a power allocation strategy for the two split streams. The results show that compared with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), RSMA outperforms them in terms of error probability and power consumption. The results show that RSMA with HARQ has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Data Reconstruction Enhancement in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are proposed to enhance the data transmission and reconstruction over wireless channels. The underlying mechanism of DDPM is to decompose the data generation process over the so-called "denoising" steps. Inspired by this, the key idea is to leverage the generative prior of diffusion models in learning a "noisy-to-clean" transformation of the information signal to help enhance data reconstruction. The proposed scheme could be beneficial for communication scenarios in which a prior knowledge of the information content is available, e.g., in multimedia transmission. Hence, instead of employing complicated channel codes that reduce the information rate, one can exploit diffusion priors for reliable data reconstruction, especially under extreme channel conditions due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or hardware-impaired communications. The proposed DDPM-assisted receiver is tailored for the scenario of wireless image transmission using MNIST dataset. Our numerical results highlight the reconstruction performance of our scheme compared to the conventional digital communication, as well as the deep neural network (DNN)-based benchmark. It is also shown that more than 10 dB improvement in the reconstruction could be achieved in low SNR regimes, without the need to reduce the information rate for error correction.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Generalized Approximate Message-Passing for Tree-Structured Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized generalized approximate message-passing (GAMP) is proposed for compressed sensing from distributed generalized linear measurements in a tree-structured network. Consensus propagation is used to realize average consensus required in GAMP via local communications between adjacent nodes. Decentralized GAMP is applicable to all tree-structured networks that do not necessarily have central nodes connected to all other nodes. State evolution is used to analyze the asymptotic dynamics of decentralized GAMP for zero-mean independent and identically distributed Gaussian sensing matrices. The state evolution recursion for decentralized GAMP is proved to have the same fixed points as that for centralized GAMP when homogeneous measurements with an identical dimension in all nodes are considered. Furthermore, existing long-memory proof strategy is used to prove that the state evolution recursion for decentralized GAMP with the Bayes-optimal denoisers converges to a fixed point. These results imply that the state evolution recursion for decentralized GAMP with the Bayes-optimal denoisers converges to the Bayes-optimal fixed point for the homogeneous measurements when the fixed point is unique. Numerical results for decentralized GAMP are presented in the cases of linear measurements and clipping. As examples of tree-structured networks, a one-dimensional chain and a tree with no central nodes are considered.</description>

      <title>Efficient Information Geometry Approach for Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the channel estimation for massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We revisit the information geometry approach (IGA) for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation. By using the constant magnitude property of the entries of the measurement matrix, we find that the second-order natural parameters of the distributions on all the auxiliary manifolds are equivalent to each other, and the first-order natural parameters are asymptotically equivalent to each other at the fixed point. Motivated by these results, we simplify the process of IGA and propose an efficient IGA (EIGA) for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation, which allows efficient implementation with fast Fourier transformation (FFT). We then establish a sufficient condition of its convergence and accordingly find a range of the damping factor for the convergence. We show that this range of damping factor is sufficiently wide by using the specific properties of the measurement matrices. Further, we prove that at the fixed point, the a posteriori mean obtained by EIGA is asymptotically optimal. Simulations confirm that EIGA can achieve the optimal performance with low complexity in a limited number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Simplified Information Geometry Approach for Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation -- Part II: Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Part II of this two-part paper, we prove the convergence of the simplified information geometry approach (SIGA) proposed in Part I. For a general Bayesian inference problem, we first show that the iteration of the common second-order natural parameter (SONP) is separated from that of the common first-order natural parameter (FONP). Hence, the convergence of the common SONP can be checked independently. We show that with the initialization satisfying a specific but large range, the common SONP is convergent regardless of the value of the damping factor. For the common FONP, we establish a sufficient condition of its convergence and prove that the convergence of the common FONP relies on the spectral radius of a particular matrix related to the damping factor. We give the range of the damping factor that guarantees the convergence in the worst case. Further, we determine the range of the damping factor for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation by using the specific properties of the measurement matrices. Simulation results are provided to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Goal-Oriented Communications under Semantic-Effectiveness Channel Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In forthcoming AI-assisted 6G networks, integrating semantic, pragmatic, and goal-oriented communication strategies becomes imperative. This integration will enable sensing, transmission, and processing of exclusively pertinent task data, ensuring conveyed information possesses understandable, pragmatic semantic significance, aligning with destination needs and goals. Without doubt, no communication is error free. Within this context, besides errors stemming from typical wireless communication dynamics, potential distortions between transmitter-intended and receiver-interpreted meanings can emerge due to limitations in semantic processing capabilities, as well as language and knowledge representation disparities between transmitters and receivers. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it proposes and details a novel mathematical modeling of errors stemming from language mismatches at both semantic and effectiveness levels. Second, it provides a novel algorithmic solution to counteract these types of errors which leverages optimal transport theory. Our numerical results show the potential of the proposed mechanism to compensate for language mismatches, thereby enhancing the attainability of reliable communication under noisy communication environments.</description>

      <title>Identification via Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study message identification over a $q$-ary uniform permutation channel, where the transmitted vector is permuted by a permutation chosen uniformly at random. For discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), the number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially. Identification capacity, the maximum second-order exponent, is known to be the same as the Shannon capacity of the DMC. Permutation channels support reliable communication of only polynomially many messages. A simple achievability result shows that message sizes growing as $2^{c_nn^{q-1}}$ are identifiable for any $c_n\rightarrow 0$. We prove two converse results. A ``soft'' converse shows that for any $R&gt;0$, there is no sequence of identification codes with message size growing as $2^{Rn^{q-1}}$ with a power-law decay ($n^{-\mu}$) of the error probability. We also prove a ``strong" converse showing that for any sequence of identification codes with message size $2^{Rn^{q-1}\log n}$ ($R&gt;0$), the sum of type I and type II error probabilities approaches at least $1$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. To prove the soft converse, we use a sequence of steps to construct a new identification code with a simpler structure which relates to a set system, and then use a lower bound on the normalized maximum pairwise intersection of a set system. To prove the strong converse, we use results on approximation of distributions.</description>

      <title>Reflection Map Construction: Enhancing and Speeding Up Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an indoor localization method using fixed reflector objects within the environment, leveraging a base station (BS) equipped with Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurement capabilities. The localization process includes two phases. In the offline phase, we identify effective reflector points within a specific region using significantly fewer test points than typical methods. In the online phase, we solve a maximization problem to locate users based on BS measurements and offline phase information. We introduce the reflectivity parameter (\(n_r\)), which quantifies the typical number of first-order reflection paths from the transmitter to the receiver, demonstrating its impact on localization accuracy. The log-scale accuracy ratio (\(R_a\)) is defined as the logarithmic function of the localization area divided by the localization ambiguity area, serving as an accuracy indicator. We show that in scenarios where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) approaches infinity, without a line of sight (LoS) link, \(R_a\) is upper-bounded by \(n_r \log_{2}\left(1 + \frac{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_A)}{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}(\mathcal{M}_s))}\right)\). Here, \(\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_A)\) and \(\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}(\mathcal{M}_s))\) represent the areas of the localization region and the area containing all reflector points with a probability of at least \(1 - \epsilon\), respectively.</description>

      <title>Age-Gain-Dependent Random Access for Event-Driven Periodic Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers utilizing the knowledge of age gains to reduce the network average age of information (AoI) in random access with event-driven periodic updating for the first time. Built on the form of slotted ALOHA, we require each device to determine its age gain threshold and transmission probability in an easily implementable decentralized manner, so that the unavoided contention can be limited to devices with age gains as high as possible. For the basic case that each device utilizes its knowledge of age gain of only itself, we provide an analytical modeling approach by a multi-layer discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs), where an external infinite-horizon DTMC manages the jumps between the beginnings of frames and an internal finite-horizon DTMC manages the evolution during an arbitrary frame. Such modelling enables that optimal access parameters can be obtained offline. For the enhanced case that each device utilizes its knowledge of age gains of all the devices, we require each device to adjust its access parameters for maximizing the estimated network \textit{expected AoI reduction} (EAR) per slot, which captures the essential for improving the contribution of the throughput to the AoI performance. To estimate the network EAR, we require each device to use Bayes' rule to keep a posteriori joint probability distribution of local age and age gain of an arbitrary device based on the channel observations. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed schemes over the existing schemes in a wide range of network configurations.</description>

      <title>PANDA: Query Evaluation in Submodular Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, several information-theoretic upper bounds have been introduced on the output size and evaluation cost of database join queries. These bounds vary in their power depending on both the type of statistics on input relations and the query plans that they support. This motivated the search for algorithms that can compute the output of a join query in times that are bounded by the corresponding information-theoretic bounds. In this paper, we describe PANDA, an algorithm that takes a Shannon-inequality that underlies the bound, and translates each proof step into an algorithmic step corresponding to some database operation. PANDA computes answers to a conjunctive query in time given by the the submodular width plus the output size of the query. The version in this paper represents a significant simplification of the original version [ANS, PODS'17].</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to higher-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relax the constraint of a shared language between agents in a semantic and goal-oriented communication system to explore the effect of language mismatch in distributed task solving. We propose a mathematical framework, which provides a modelling and a measure of the semantic distortion introduced in the communication when agents use distinct languages. We then propose a new approach to semantic channel equalization with proven effectiveness through numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Soft Partitioning of Latent Space for Semantic Channel Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic channel equalization has emerged as a solution to address language mismatch in multi-user semantic communications. This approach aims to align the latent spaces of an encoder and a decoder which were not jointly trained and it relies on a partition of the semantic (latent) space into atoms based on the the semantic meaning. In this work we explore the role of the semantic space partition in scenarios where the task structure involves a one-to-many mapping between the semantic space and the action space. In such scenarios, partitioning based on hard inference results results in loss of information which degrades the equalization performance. We propose a soft criterion to derive the atoms of the partition which leverages the soft decoder's output and offers a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic space's structure. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that soft partitioning yields a more descriptive and regular partition of the space, consequently enhancing the performance of the equalization algorithm.</description>
