      <title>Quasi-stars as a Means of Rapid Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations demonstrate that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist by redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$, providing further evidence for "direct collapse" black hole (BH) formation, whereby massive ($\sim 10^{3-5} M_{\odot}$) SMBH seeds are generated within a few Myr as a byproduct of the rapid inflow of gas into the centers of protogalaxies. Here we analyze the intermediate "quasi-star" phase that accompanies some direct collapse models, during which a natal BH accretes mass from and energetically sustains (through accretion) an overlying gaseous envelope. We argue that previous estimates of the maximum BH mass that can be reached during this stage, $\sim 1\%$ of the total quasi-star mass, are unphysical, and arise from underestimating the efficiency with which energy can be transported outward from regions close to the BH. We construct new quasi-star models that consist of an inner, "saturated-convection" region (which conforms to a convection-dominated accretion flow near the BH) matched to an outer, adiabatic envelope. These solutions exist up to a BH mass of $\sim 60\%$ the total quasi-star mass, at which point the adiabatic envelope contains only 2\% of the mass (with the remaining $\sim 38\%$ in the saturated-convection region), and this upper limit is reached within a time of $20-40$ Myr. We conclude that quasi-stars remain a viable route for producing SMBHs at large redshifts, consistent with recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the star formation rate measurements by direct star count in molecular clouds</title>

Abstract: Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) IX. The largest detailed chemical analysis of very metal-poor stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most metal-poor stars provide valuable insights into the early chemical enrichment history of a system, carrying the chemical imprints of the first generations of supernovae. The most metal-poor region of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy remains inadequately observed and characterised. To date, only a handful of stars with [Fe/H]$&lt;-2.0$ have been chemically analysed with high-resolution spectroscopy. In this study, we present the most extensive chemical abundance analysis of 12 low-metallicity stars with metallicities down to [Fe/H]$=-3.26$ and located in the main body of Sagittarius. These targets, selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy survey, were observed using the MIKE high-resolution spectrograph at the Magellan-Clay telescope, which allows us to measure up to 17 chemical species. The chemical composition of these stars reflects the imprint of a variety of type~II supernovae. A combination of low- to intermediate-mass core-collapse and hypernovae ($\sim10-70 M_{\odot}$) is required to account for the abundance patterns of the lighter elements up to the Fe-peak. The trend of the heavy elements suggests the involvement of compact binary merger events and fast-rotating (up to $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$) intermediate-mass to massive metal-poor stars ($\sim25-120 M_{\odot}$) that are the sources of rapid- and slow-processes, respectively. Additionally, asymptotic giant branch stars contribute to a wide dispersion of [Ba/Mg] and [Ba/Eu]. The absence of an $\alpha-$knee in our data indicates that type Ia supernovae did not contribute in the very metal-poor region ( [Fe/H]$\leq-2.0$). However, they might have started to pollute the interstellar medium at [Fe/H]$&gt;-2.0$, given the relatively low [Co/Fe] in this metallicity region.</description>

      <title>Applying machine learning to Galactic Archaeology: how well can we recover the origin of stars in Milky Way-like galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several machine learning (ML) models developed to efficiently separate stars formed in-situ in Milky Way-type galaxies from those that were formed externally and later accreted. These models, which include examples from artificial neural networks, decision trees and dimensionality reduction techniques, are trained on a sample of disc-like, Milky Way-mass galaxies drawn from the ARTEMIS cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We find that the input parameters which provide an optimal performance for these models consist of a combination of stellar positions, kinematics, chemical abundances ([Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe]) and photometric properties. Models from all categories perform similarly well, with area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) scores of $\simeq 0.6$. Beyond a galactocentric radius of $5$~kpc, models retrieve $&gt;90\%$ of accreted stars, with a sample purity close to $60\%$, however the purity can be increased by adjusting the classification threshold. For one model, we also include host galaxy-specific properties in the training, to account for the variability of accretion histories of the hosts, however this does not lead to an improvement in performance. The ML models can identify accreted stars even in regions heavily dominated by the in-situ component (e.g., in the disc), and perform well on an unseen suite of simulations (the Auriga simulations). The general applicability bodes well for application of such methods on observational data to identify accreted substructures in the Milky Way without the need to resort to selection cuts for minimising the contamination from in-situ stars.</description>

      <title>A 3D view on the local gravitational instability of cold gas discs in star-forming galaxies at $0 \lesssim \mathrm{z} \lesssim 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local gravitational instability (LGI) is considered crucial for regulating star formation and gas turbulence in galaxy discs, especially at high redshift. Instability criteria usually assume infinitesimally thin discs or rely on approximations to include the stabilising effect of the gas disc thickness. We test a new 3D instability criterion for rotating gas discs that are vertically stratified in an external potential. This criterion reads $Q_{\rm3D}&lt;1$, where $Q_{\rm3D}$ is the 3D analogue of the Toomre parameter $Q$. The advantage of $Q_{\rm3D}$ is that it allows us to study LGI in and above the galaxy midplane in a rigorous and self-consistent way. We apply the criterion to a sample of 44 star-forming galaxies at $0\lesssim\mathrm{z}\lesssim5$ hosting rotating discs of cold gas. The sample is representative of galaxies on the main sequence at $\mathrm{z}\approx 0$ and includes massive star-forming and starburst galaxies at $1\lesssim\mathrm{z}\lesssim5$. For each galaxy, we first apply the Toomre criterion for infinitesimally thin discs, finding 10 unstable systems. We then obtain maps of $Q_{\rm 3D}$ from a 3D model of the gas disc derived in the combined potential of dark matter, stars and the gas itself. According to the 3D criterion, two galaxies with $Q&lt;1$ show no evidence of instability and the unstable regions that are 20% smaller than those where $Q&lt;1$. No unstable disc is found at $0\lesssim\mathrm{z}\lesssim 1$, while $\approx 60$% of the systems at $2\lesssim\mathrm{z}\lesssim5$ are locally unstable. In these latter, a relatively small fraction of the total gas ($\approx 30$%) is potentially affected by the instability. Our results disfavour LGI as the main regulator of star formation and turbulence in moderately star-forming galaxies in the present-day Universe. LGI likely becomes important at high redshift, but the input by other mechanisms seems required [abridged]</description>

      <title>Impacts of bar-driven shear and shocks on star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars drive gas inflow. As the gas flows inwards, shocks and shear occur along the bar dust lanes. Such shocks and shear can affect the star formation and change the gas properties. For four barred galaxies, we present H{\alpha} velocity gradient maps that highlight bar-driven shocks and shear using data from the PHANGS-MUSE and PHANGS-ALMA surveys which allow us to study bar kinematics in unprecedented detail. Velocity gradients are enhanced along the bar dust lanes, where shocks and shear are shown to occur in numerical simulations. Velocity gradient maps also efficiently pick up expanding shells around HII regions. We put pseudo slits on the regions where velocity gradients are enhanced and find that H{\alpha} and CO velocities jump up to ~170 km/s, even after removing the effects of circular motions due to the galaxy rotation. Enhanced velocity gradients either coincide with the peak of CO intensity along the bar dust lanes or are slightly offset from CO intensity peaks, depending on the objects. Using the BPT diagnostic, we identify the source of ionization on each spaxel and find that star formation is inhibited in the high velocity gradient regions of the bar, and the majority of those regions are classified as LINER or composite. This implies that star formation is inhibited where bar-driven shear and shocks are strong. Our results are consistent with the results from the numerical simulations that show star formation is inhibited in the bar where shear force is strong.</description>

      <title>OCCASO V. Chemical-abundance trends with Galactocentric distance and age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Open clusters provide valuable information on stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their age and distances can be measured more precisely with photometry than for field stars. Aims. Our aim is to study the chemical distribution of the Galactic disc using open clusters by analysing the existence of gradients with Galactocentric distance, azimuth or height from the plane and dependency with age. Methods. High-resolution spectra (R&gt;60 000) of 194 stars belonging to 36 open clusters are used to determine atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances with two independent methods: equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. The sample has been complemented with 63 clusters with high-resolution spectroscopy from literature. Results. We measure local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for 21 elements: {\alpha} (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), odd-Z (Na and Al), Fe-peak (Fe, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn), and neutron-capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, and Nd). We also provide non-local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for elements when corrections are available. We find inner disc young clusters enhanced in [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] compared to other clusters of their age. For [Ba/Fe] we report an age trend flattening for older clusters (age&lt;2.5 Ga). The studied elements follow the expected radial gradients as a function of their nucleosynthesis groups, which are significantly steeper for the oldest systems. For the first time, we investigate the existence of an azimuthal gradient, finding some hints of its existence among the old clusters (age&gt;2 Ga).</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of a Major Merger in the Perseus Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Perseus cluster has often been regarded as an archetypical relaxed galaxy cluster, several lines of evidence including cold fronts, asymmetric plasma morphology, filamentary galaxy distribution, etc., provide a conflicting view of its dynamical state, suggesting that the cluster might have experienced a major merger. However, the absence of a clear merging companion identified to date hampers our understanding of the evolutionary track of the Perseus cluster consistent with these observational features. In this paper, through careful weak lensing analysis, we successfully identified the missing subcluster halo ($M_{200}=1.70^{+0.73}_{-0.59}\times10^{14}~M_{\odot}$) at the &gt;5$\sigma$ level centered on NGC1264, which is located ~430 kpc west of the Perseus main cluster core. Moreover, a significant ($&gt;3\sigma$) mass bridge is detected between the Perseus main and sub clusters, which serves as direct evidence of gravitational interaction. This mass bridge is also traced by the cluster member galaxies. With idealized numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a ~3:1 major merger can create the cold front observed ~700 kpc east of the main cluster core and also generate the observed mass bridge through multiple core crossings.</description>

      <title>A Simulation of the Dependence of Tidal Interaction on Galaxy Type in Compact Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the role that different galaxy types have in galaxy-galaxy interactions in compact groups. N-body simulations of 6 galaxies consisting of a differing mixture of galaxy types were run to compare the relative importance of galaxy population demographic on evolution. Three different groups with differing galaxy content were tested: all spiral, a single elliptical and 50% elliptical. Tidal interaction strength and duration were recorded to assess the importance of an interaction. A group with an equal number of spiral and elliptical galaxies has some of the longest and strongest interactions with elliptical-elliptical interactions being most significant. These elliptical-elliptical interactions are not dominated by a single large event but consist of multiple interactions. Elliptical galaxies tidally interacting with spiral galaxies, have the next strongest interaction events. For the case when a group only has a single elliptical, the largest magnitude tidal interaction is an elliptical on a spiral. Spirals interact with each other through many small interactions. For a spiral only group, the interactions are the weakest compared to the other group types. These spiral interactions are not dominated by any singular event that might be expected to lead to a merger but are more of an ongoing harassment. These results suggest that within a compact group, early type galaxies will not form via merger out of an assemblage of spiral galaxies but rather that compact groups, in effect form around an early type galaxy.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-Absorber Association in the Epoch of Reionization: Galactic Population Luminosity Distribution for Different Absorbers at $10 \geq z \geq 5.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do galaxies of different luminosities contribute to the metal absorber populations of varying species and strength? We present our analysis of the predicted metal contributions from galaxies as observed in quasar absorption line spectra during the end of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR; $10 \geq z \geq 5.5$). This was done by implementing on-the-fly particle tracking into the latest \textsc{Technicolor Dawn} simulation and then linking CII, CIV, SiII, SiIV, OI, and MgII absorbers to host galaxies in post-processing. We define the Host Galaxy Luminosity Distribution (HGLD) as the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity distribution of galaxies contributing ions to an absorber, weighted by the fractional contribution, and compute its dependence on ion and absorber strength. The HGLD shape is predicted to be indistinguishable from the field luminosity function, indicating that there is no relationship between the absorber strength or ion and the luminosity of the dominant contributing galaxy. Switching from galaxy luminosity to stellar mass, the predicted host galaxy mass distributions (HGMD) indicate that more-massive galaxies contribute a higher fraction of metal ions to absorbers of each species, with the HGMD of stronger absorbers extending out to higher masses. We conclude that the fraction of absorbing metal ions contributed by galaxies increases weakly with stellar mass, but the scatter in luminosity at fixed stellar mass obscures this relationship. For the same reason, we predict that observational analyses of the absorber-galaxy relationship will uncover stronger trends with stellar mass than with luminosity.</description>

      <title>Constraining the giant radio galaxy population with machine learning and Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale sky surveys at low frequencies, like the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), allow for the detection and characterisation of unprecedented numbers of giant radio galaxies (GRGs, or 'giants'). In this work, by automating the creation of radio--optical catalogues, we aim to significantly expand the census of known giants. We then combine this sample with a forward model to constrain GRG properties of cosmological interest. In particular, we automate radio source component association through machine learning and optical host identification for resolved radio sources. We create a radio--optical catalogue for the full LoTSS Data Release 2 (DR2) and select all possible giants. We combine our candidates with an existing catalogue of LoTSS DR2 crowd-sourced GRG candidates and visually confirm or reject them. To infer intrinsic GRG properties from GRG observations, we develop further a population-based forward model that takes into account selection effects and constrain its parameters using Bayesian inference. We confirm 5,647 previously unknown giants from the crowd-sourced catalogue and 2,597 previously unknown giants from the ML-driven catalogue. Our confirmations and discoveries bring the total number of known giants to at least 11,585. We predict a comoving GRG number density $n_\mathrm{GRG} = 13 \pm 10\ (100\ \mathrm{Mpc})^{-3}$, close to a recent estimate of the number density of luminous non-giant radio galaxies. We derive a current-day GRG lobe volume-filling fraction $V_\mathrm{GRG-CW}(z = 0) = 1.4 \pm 1.1 \cdot 10^{-5}$ in clusters and filaments of the Cosmic Web. Our analysis suggests that giants are more common than previously thought. Moreover, tentative results imply that it is possible that magnetic fields once contained in giants pervade a significant ($\gtrsim 10\%$) fraction of today's Cosmic Web.</description>

      <title>The relationship between the turnover frequency and photo-ionisation in radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between the turnover frequency in the radio spectrum, $\nu_{\rm TO}$, and the rate of ionising ultra-violet photons, $Q_{\rm HI}$, in extragalactic sources. From a large, optically selected, sample we find $\nu_{\rm TO}$ to be correlated with $Q_{\rm HI}$ in sources which exhibit a turnover. The significance of the correlation decreases when we include power-law radio sources as limits, by assuming that the turnover frequency occurs below the lowest value observed. However, the power-law fit sources are less well sampled across the band and so these may just be contributing noise to the data. Given that the observed $\nu_{\rm TO}$--$Q_{\rm HI}$ correlation is purely empirical, we use the ionising photon rate to obtain the electron density in a free-free absorption model. For each of the constant, exponential, constant plus exponential (Milky Way) and spherical models of the gas distribution, there is also an increase in the turnover frequency with ionising photon rate. Furthermore, for a given gas mass, we find that the turnover frequency is anti-correlated with the scale-factor of the gas density. While other mechanisms, such as ageing electrons or synchrotron self-absorption, may be required to reproduce the spectral indices, for an exponential scale-factor similar to the linear size, this simple free-free absorption model reproduces the turnover-size correlation seen in radio sources.</description>

      <title>Near Infrared Diffuse Interstellar Bands Characterized by Fullerene and Graphene Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical near-infrared Diffuse-Interstellar-Bands (DIBs) were characterized by pure carbon Fullerene and Graphene molecules comparing with laboratory experiment and with Time-Dependent Density-Functional-Theory (TD-DFT) analysis. It is well known that two large DIBs of Fullerene cation (C60)+ at 9577A and 9632A coincide well with laboratory experiments. Those are thought to be split bands by the Jahn-Teller molecular deformation. In our TD-DFT calculation, those are reproduced by degenerated bands at 9549A and 9552A before deformation. Cation enriching experiment by Strelnikov et al. suggested longer wavelength two bands of DIB10542 and DIB10610 (observed by Hamano et al.), which may split from calculated 10410A and 10411A. Also, we noticed shorter wavelength experimental band around 8550A, which may relate to calculated 8677A and 8686A. We challenged such analysis on Graphene molecules as like (C54) (C53) (C52) and (C51), which are carbon hexagon and pentagon combined molecules. Calculation could reproduce many near-infrared bands. Calculated bands of (C54) suggest that one DIB among (DIB9577, DIB9632, or DIB9673) may correspond to one of (DIB10361, DIB10394, or DIB10439). Calculated bands of (C51) suggest that one of (DIB9686, DIB9987, or DIB10006) may relate to one of (DIB10262 or DIB10288). Combining astronomical observation, laboratory experiment, and quantum chemical analysis, we could suggest carrier candidates of DIBs.</description>

      <title>Evolution of grain size distribution in the circum-galactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to theoretically understand dust properties in the circum-galactic medium (CGM), we construct a dust evolution model that incorporates the evolution of grain size distribution. We treat each of the galaxy and the CGM as a one-zone object, and consider the mass exchange between them. We take into account dust production and interstellar dust processing for the galaxy based on our previous models, and newly incorporate sputtering in the hot phase and shattering in the cool phase for the CGM. We find that shattering increases the dust destruction (sputtering) efficiency in the CGM. The functional shape of the grain size distribution in the CGM evolves following that in the galaxy, but it is sensitive to the balance between sputtering and shattering in the CGM. For an observational test, we discuss the wavelength dependence of the reddening in the CGM traced by background quasar colors, arguing that, in order to explain the observed reddening level, a rapid inflow from the CGM to the galaxy is favored because of quick dust/metal enrichment. Small grain production by shattering in the CGM also helps to explain the rise of dust extinction toward short wavelengths.</description>

      <title>At the same age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement, sodium is a more effective tracer of the young and old sequences of the Milky Way disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trends in the enrichment of elements with stellar ages are a powerful avenue to identify unexplained origins of the elements. We investigate the stellar abundance trends of low to intermediate-mass stars using the GALAH DR3 high-resolution spectroscopic dataset of 6234 solar-type stars. Our study explores the elemental abundance [X/Fe] of sodium (Na) with age. We find a pronounced enrichment in [Na/Fe] at super solar metallicity (i.e., [Fe/H] above 0) in the old sequence of Milky Way disc stars, a trend demanding a deeper understanding of the underlying source(s) responsible for the nucleosynthesis. This progressive [Na/Fe] enrichment at the young end of the old sequence has essential implications for Galactic archaeology. In this work, we propose a novel selection technique for separating the Milky Way's thick and thin disc stellar populations (i.e., old and young sequences) based on the observed [Na/Fe] rise of roughly 0.1 dex for stars around 5 - 8 Gyr old. We also compare our selection method to the conventional [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] selection approach, and we find that our new Na-based selection method better disentangles the overlap between young- and old-sequence disc stars at these intermediate ages. This is especially true at super solar [Fe/H], where [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] or [alpha/Fe] vs [Fe/H] separation approaches exhibit a lot of overlap. This new selection method should help us better understand the Milky Way disc's formation history.</description>

      <title>DEVILS/MIGHTEE/GAMA/DINGO: The Impact of SFR Timescales on the SFR-Radio Luminosity Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tight relationship between infrared luminosity (L$_\mathrm{TIR}$) and 1.4 GHz radio continuum luminosity (L$_\mathrm{1.4GHz}$) has proven useful for understanding star formation free from dust obscuration. Infrared emission in star-forming galaxies typically arises from recently formed, dust-enshrouded stars, whereas radio synchrotron emission is expected from subsequent supernovae. By leveraging the wealth of ancillary far-ultraviolet - far-infrared photometry from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) and Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) surveys, combined with 1.4 GHz observations from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey and Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) projects, we investigate the impact of timescale differences between far-ultraviolet - far-infrared and radio-derived star formation rate (SFR) tracers. We examine how the SED-derived star formation histories (SFH) of galaxies can be used to explain discrepancies in these SFR tracers, which are sensitive to different timescales. Galaxies exhibiting an increasing SFH have systematically higher L$_\mathrm{TIR}$ and SED-derived SFRs than predicted from their 1.4 GHz radio luminosity. This indicates that insufficient time has passed for subsequent supernovae-driven radio emission to accumulate. We show that backtracking the SFR(t) of galaxies along their SED-derived SFHs to a time several hundred megayears prior to their observed epoch will both linearise the SFR-L$_\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ relation and reduce the overall scatter. The minimum scatter in the SFR(t)-L$_\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ is reached at 200 - 300 Myr prior, consistent with theoretical predictions for the timescales required to disperse the cosmic ray electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS Paper V. The dependence of galaxy formation on galaxy structure at z &lt; 7 from JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the broad impact of galaxy structure on galaxy formation by examining the ongoing star formation and integrated star formation history as revealed through the stellar masses of galaxies at $z &lt; 7$ based on JWST CEERS data from the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). Using the morphological catalog of 3965 visually classified JWST galaxies from Ferreira et al. (2023), we investigate the evolution of stars, and when they form, as a function of morphological type as well as galaxies classified as passive and starburst through spectral energy distributions. Although disk galaxies dominate the structures of galaxies at $z &lt; 7$, we find that these disks are in general either `passive', or on the main-sequence of star formation, and do not contain a large population of starburst galaxies. We also find no significant correlation between morphological type and the star formation rate or colours of galaxies at $z &lt; 7$. In fact, we find that the morphologically classified `spheroids' tend to be blue and are not found to be predominately passive systems at $z &gt; 1.5$. We also find that the stellar mass function for disk galaxies does not evolve significantly during this time, whereas other galaxy types, such as the peculiar population, evolve dramatically, declining at lower redshifts. This indicates that massive peculiars are more common at higher redshifts. We further find that up to $z \sim 7$, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) does not vary with visual morphology, but strongly depends on stellar mass and internal galaxy mass density. This demonstrates that at early epochs galaxy assembly is a mass-driven, rather than a morphologically-driven, process. Quenching of star formation is therefore a mass-dominated process throughout the universe's history, likely due to the presence of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Main sequence of star formation and colour bimodality considering galaxy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study involves the use of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12) also referred to as the Legacy Survey to investigate the influence of the galaxy environment on the main sequence of star formation, colour bimodality and the quenching of star formation rate. We classify the galaxies according to the ratio of their emission lines and based on their environment (isolated and non-isolated). We find that for $z\lesssim 0.09$, the fraction of non-isolated galaxies is greater than isolated galaxies, whereas for $z&gt;0.09$ the opposite result is observed. Quenching is observed to be influenced by the environment at $M_\star &lt; 10^{10.7} M_{\odot}$ (mostly for the star-forming and composite galaxies), while for $M_{\star }\geq 10^{10.7} M_{\odot}$ (mostly for Seyfert galaxies and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions), the effect of the environment is very weak. We observe the decrease in the slope of the star formation main sequence by $\sim\! 0.02$ dex and the intercept by $\sim\! 0.17$ dex for non-isolated galaxies in comparison to isolated galaxies. We also find that star-forming, composite, Seyfert galaxies and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions form the evolutionary pathways, where most star-forming galaxies ($\sim\! 60\%$) are found in the blue cloud, both composite ($\sim\! 50\%$) and Seyfert ($\sim\! 49\%$) galaxies in the green valley and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions ($\sim 60\%$) in the red sequence. The study concludes that the environment in which the galaxies reside influences the shape of the star formation main sequence, quenching and hence colour bimodality especially for star-forming and composite galaxies while for Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies, there is a mild impact.</description>

      <title>A study of Galactic Plane Planck Galactic Cold Clumps observed by SCOPE and the JCMT Plane Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the physical properties of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) located in the Galactic Plane, using the JCMT Plane Survey (JPS) and the SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution (SCOPE) survey. By utilising a suite of molecular-line surveys, velocities and distances were assigned to the compact sources within the PGCCs, placing them in a Galactic context. The properties of these compact sources show no large-scale variations with Galactic environment. Investigating the star-forming content of the sample, we find that the luminosity-to-mass ratio (L/M) is an order of magnitude lower than in other Galactic studies, indicating that these objects are hosting lower levels of star formation. Finally, by comparing ATLASGAL sources that are associated or are not associated with PGCCs, we find that those associated with PGCCs are typically colder, denser, and have a lower L/M ratio, hinting that PGCCs are a distinct population of Galactic Plane sources.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of a search for Miras and long-period variables (LPVs) in M33 using griJHKs archival observations from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope. We use multiband information and machine learning techniques to identify and characterize these variables. We recover ~1,300 previously-discovered Mira candidates and identify ~13,000 new Miras and LPVs. We detect for the first time a clear first-overtone pulsation sequence among Mira candidates in this galaxy. We use O-rich, fundamental-mode Miras in the LMC and M33 to derive a distance modulus for the latter of 24.629 +/- 0.046 mag.</description>

      <title>JWST meets Chandra: a large population of Compton thick, feedback-free, and X-ray weak AGN, with a sprinkle of SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray properties of a large sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. Heavy X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasar; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of Halpha in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack the prominent, fast outflows characterizing low-z AGN and luminous quasars, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN match the definition of NLSy1, typically characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum, and this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars, Tidal Disruption Events, or Supernovae, although we show that a minority of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with the echo of superluminous SNe or TDE. Scenarios in which the broad lines are ascribed to galactic outflows are also untenable. We emphasize that confirming any of the scenarios discussed above will require X-ray missions more sensitive than Chandra. (abridged)</description>

      <title>X-ray spectral properties of dust-obscured galaxies in the XMM-SERVS coverage of the XMM-LSS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an aim to unveil the population of obscured AGN hosted in high-$z$ dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs), we performed X-ray spectral study of $34$ DOGs ($0.59$ $\leq$ $z$ $\leq$ $4.65$) lying within $5.3$ deg$^{2}$ of the XMM-SERVS coverage in the XMM-LSS field. To improve the spectral quality of individual sources, we combined all the existing $\textit{XMM-Newton}$ data and also included $\textit{Chandra}$/ACIS data, whenever available. We find that the X-ray spectra of our DOGs can be fitted with a simple absorbed power law or with a physically-motivated BORUS02 model. The line-of-sight column densities ($N_{\textrm{H}}$) in our sources span across a wide range ($1.02$ $\times$ $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $\leq$ $N_{\textrm{H}}$ $\leq$ $1.21$ $\times$ $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$), with a substantial fraction ($\sim$ $17.6$ per cent) of them being heavily obscured ($N_{\textrm{H}}$ $\geq$ $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). We also identified one new CT-AGN candidate, yielding the CT-AGN fraction in our sample to be only $3$ per cent. The absorption-corrected $2.0-10$ keV X-ray luminosities of our sources ($2.00~\times~10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\leq$ $L_{\textrm{2-10 keV}}^{\textrm{int}}$ $\leq$ $6.17~\times~10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) suggest them to be luminous quasars. The $N_{\textrm{H}}$ versus Eddington ratio diagnostic plot infers that our sample consists of a heterogeneous population that includes a small fraction ($\sim$ $12$ per cent) of DOGs belonging to an early phase (Hot DOGs) during which accretion and obscuration peaks, while the remaining DOGs belong to an intermediate or late phase during which radiative feedback from the dominant AGN blows away surrounding obscuring material.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the stellar recycled gas in active galactic nuclei feeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared long-slit spectroscopy has been used to study the stellar population (SP) of the low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and matched analogues (LLAMA) sample. To perform the SP fits we have employed the X-shooter simple stellar population models together with the \st\ code. Our main conclusions are: The star formation history of the AGNs is very complex, presenting many episodes of star formation during their lifetimes. In general, AGN hosts have higher fractions of intermediate-age SP (light-weighted mean ages, $&lt;t&gt;_L\lesssim$ 4.5 Gyr) when compared with their analogues ($&lt;t&gt;_L\lesssim$ 8.0 Gyr). AGN are more affected by reddening and require significant fractions of featureless continuum and hot dust components. The ratio between the AGN radiated energy and the gravitational potential energy of the molecular gas ($E_{Rad}$/$E_{PG}$) for the AGN is compared with the \maL\ and a possible anti-correlation is observed. This suggests that the AGN is affecting the star formation in these galaxies, in the sense that more energetic AGN (log$(E_{Rad}$/$E_{PG}) \gtrsim 3$) tend to host nuclear younger SP ($ &lt;t&gt;_L \lesssim$4Gyr). We found that the recent ($t&lt;$2~Gyr) returned (recycled) stellar mass is higher in AGN than in the controls. We also provide evidence that the mass loss of stars would be enough to feed the AGN, thus providing observational constraints for models that predict that AGN feeding is partially due to the recycled gas from dying stars.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble Space Telescope has devoted 500 orbits to observing 250 massive stars with low metallicity in the ultraviolet (UV) range within the framework of the ULLYSES program. The X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) project enhances the legacy value of this UV dataset by providing high-quality optical and near-infrared spectra, which are acquired using the wide-wavelength-coverage X-shooter spectrograph at ESO's Very Large Telescope. XShootU emphasises the importance of combining UV with optical spectra for the consistent determination of key stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, abundances, and wind characteristics including mass-loss rates as a function of metallicity. Since uncertainties in these parameters have implications across various branches of astrophysics, the data and modelling generated by the XShootU project are poised to significantly advance our understanding of massive stars at low metallicity. This is particularly crucial for confidently interpreting JWST data of the earliest stellar generations, making XShootU a unique resource for comprehending individual spectra of low-metallicity stars.</description>

      <title>A population of neutron star candidates in wide orbits from Gaia astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report discovery and spectroscopic follow-up of 21 astrometric binaries containing solar-type stars and dark companions with masses near 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The simplest interpretation is that the companions are dormant neutron stars (NSs), though ultramassive white dwarfs (WDs) and tight WD+WD binaries cannot be fully excluded. We selected targets from Gaia DR3 astrometric binary solutions in which the luminous star is on the main sequence and the dynamically-implied mass of the unseen companion is (a) more than $1.25\,M_{\odot}$ and (b) too high to be any non-degenerate star or close binary. We obtained multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) over a period of 650 days, spanning a majority of the orbits' dynamic range in RV. The RVs broadly validate the astrometric solutions and significantly tighten constraints on companion masses. Several systems have companion masses that are unambiguously above the Chandrasekhar limit, while the rest have masses between 1.25 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The orbits are significantly more eccentric at fixed period than those of typical WD + MS binaries, perhaps due to natal kicks. Metal-poor stars are overrepresented in the sample: 3 out of 21 objects (14%) have [Fe/H]$\sim-1.5$ and are on halo orbits, compared to $\sim 0.5\%$ of the parent Gaia binary sample. The metal-poor stars are all strongly enhanced in lithium. The formation history of these objects is puzzling: it is unclear both how the binaries escaped a merger or dramatic orbital shrinkage when the NS progenitors were red supergiants, and how they remained bound when the NSs formed. Gaia has now discovered 3 black holes (BHs) in astrometric binaries with masses above 9 $M_{\odot}$, and 21 NSs with masses near $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. The lack of intermediate-mass objects in this sample is striking, supporting the existence of a BH/NS mass bimodality over 4 orders of magnitude in orbital period.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a toroidal magnetic field in the core of 3C 84</title>

Abstract: The spatial scales of relativistic radio jets, probed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic jet launching simulations (RMHDs) and by most very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations differ by an order of magnitude. Bridging the gap between these RMHD simulations and VLBI observations requires selecting nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), the parsec-scale region of which can be resolved. 3C 84 is a nearby bright AGN fulfilling the necessary requirements: it is launching a powerful, relativistic jet powered by a central supermassive black hole, while also being very bright. Using 22 GHz global VLBI measurements of 3C 84 we aim to study its sub-parsec region in both total intensity and linear polarisation, to explore the properties of this jet, with a linear resolution of $\sim0.1$ parsec. We test different simulation setups by altering the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the jet, as well as the magnetic field configuration (toroidal, poloidal, helical). We confirm the persistence of a limb brightened structure, which reaches deep into the sub-parsec region. The corresponding electric vector position angles (EVPAs) follow the bulk jet flow inside but tend to be orthogonal to it near the edges. Our state-of-the-art RMHD simulations show that this geometry is consistent with a spine-sheath model, associated with a mildly relativistic flow and a toroidal magnetic field configuration.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Reionization on Computers: The Evolution of Ionizing Background and Mean Free Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the end stages of reionization indicate that at $z\approx 5-6$, the ionizing background is not uniform and the mean free path (MFP) changes drastically. As MFP is closely related to the distribution of Lyman Limit Systems and Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (LLSs and DLAs, or ionizing photon "sinks"), it is important to understand them. In this study, we utilize the CROC simulations, which have both sufficient spatial resolution to resolve galaxy formation and LLSs alongside a fully coupled radiative transfer to simulate the reionization processes. In our analysis, we connect the evolution of the ionizing background and the MFP. We analyze two CROC boxes with distinct reionization histories and find that the distribution of ionizing background in both simulations display significant skewness that deviate from log-normal. Further, the ionizing background in late reionization box still displays significant fluctuations ($\sim 40\%$) at $z\approx5$. We also measure the MFP along sightlines that start 0.15 pMpc away from the center of potential quasar hosting halos. The evolution of the MFP measured from these sightlines exhibits a break that coincides with when all the neutral islands disappear in the reionization history of each box (the `ankle' of the reionization history of the box). In the absence of LLSs, the MFP will be biased high by $\approx 20\%$ at $z\approx 5$. We also compare the MFP measured in random sightlines. We find that at $z\approx 5$ the MFP measured in sightlines that start from massive halos are systematically smaller by $\approx 10\%$ compared with the MFP measured in random sightlines. We attribute this difference to the concentration of dense structures within 1 pMpc from massive halos. Our findings highlight the importance of high fidelity models in the interpretation of observational measurements.</description>

      <title>The Extremely Metal-Poor SN 2023ufx: A Local Analog to High-Redshift Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ufx which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to-date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity ($Z_{\rm host} \sim 0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf ($M_g = -13.23\pm0.15$~mag; $r_e\sim 1$~kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at $M_g\approx -18.5~$mag, and shows rapid evolution. The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the pre-explosion mass-loss rate to $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$/yr. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$. The semi-nebular ($\sim 60-130~$d) spectra reveal weak Fe II, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti II, Sc II, Ba II) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad ($\approx 10^4~\rm{km}~\rm s^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\gamma$ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly-rotating progenitors which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A deconstruction of methods to derive one-point lensing statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a crucial tool for exploring cosmic phenomena, providing insights into galaxy clustering, dark matter, and dark energy. Given the substantial computational demands of $N$-body simulations, approximate methods like $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ offer viable alternatives for simulating lensing probability density functions (PDFs). This paper evaluates these methods in contexts where baryonic effects are negligible, focusing on dark matter-dominated models and assessing their effectiveness across both weak and strong lensing regimes. Our comparative analysis reveals that these methods are particularly effective for applications involving electromagnetic and gravitational wave point sources, where strong lensing events are infrequent. Both $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ perform well in modeling the weak-lensing region influenced by mildly nonlinear structures. However, they lose accuracy in capturing small-scale nonlinear matter fields, owing to oversimplified assumptions about internal halo structures and reliance on perturbation theory. The analysis shows that $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ achieves an 8-15% agreement with $N$-body simulations for the second-to-fourth moments of lensing PDFs. These findings aim to inform future studies on gravitational lensing of point sources, which are increasingly relevant with upcoming supernova and gravitational wave datasets.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebula NGC 2818: Revealing its complex 3D morphology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out an advanced morpho-kinematic analysis of the Planetary Nebula (PN) NGC 2818, whose complex morphology is described by a basic bipolar component, filamentary structures and a knotty central region. We performed an upgrated 3D Morpho-kinematic (MK) model by employing the SHAPE software, combining for the first time in PNe optical 2D spatially resolved echelle spectra and Fabry-Perot data cubes. The best-fitting 3D model of NGC 2818 successfully reconstructs the main morphology, considering one bipolar component, radial filamentary structures, and an equatorial component as the geometrical locus of the group of cometary knots. The model shows that the equatorial component has the lower expansion velocity of the system at 70 $\pm$ 20 km/s. The velocity of the bipolar component is 120 $\pm$ 20 km/s, while all the filamentary structures were found to expand at higher velocities of 180 $\pm$ 20 km/s. Moreover, Fabry-Perot data revealed for the first time a north-eastern filament expanding at a mean velocity of 80 $\pm$ 20 km/s, while its equivalent counterpart in the southwestern region was confirmed by a new detected substructure in the echelle data. A new detected knotty structure at velocity -40 $\pm$ 20 km/s is also reported, as expelled material from the fragmented eastern lobe of the nebula. We interpret the overall structure of NGC 2818 as the result of the evolution of a binary system that underwent the common envelope phase, in conjunction with the ejections of a magnetized jet, misaligned with respect to the symmetry axis of the bipolar/elliptical shell.</description>

      <title>Migration of Accreting Planets and Black Holes in Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk (PPD) via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in AGN disks. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, in all of our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($\Delta\dot M$ and $\Delta\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that extra caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.</description>

      <title>Resolution analysis of magnetically arrested disk simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarisation measurements by the Event Horizon Telescope from M87$^{\ast}$ and Sgr A$^\ast$ suggest that there is a dynamically strong, ordered magnetic field, typical of what is expected of a magnetically arrested accretion disk (MAD). In such disks the strong poloidal magnetic field can suppress the accretion flow and cause episodic flux eruptions. Recent work shows that General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) MAD simulations feature dynamics of turbulence and mixing instabilities that are becoming resolved at higher resolutions. We perform a convergence study of MADs exceeding the status quo by an order of magnitude in resolution. We use existing 3D simulations performed with the H-AMR code, up to resolution of 5376 x 2304 x 2304 in a logarithmic spherical-polar grid. We find consistent time-averaged disk properties across all resolutions. However, higher resolutions reveal signs of inward angular momentum transport attributed to turbulent convection, particularly evident when mixing instabilities occur at the surfaces of flux tubes during flux eruptions. Additionally, we see wave-like features in the jet sheath, which become more prominent at higher resolutions, that may induce mixing between jet and disk. At higher resolutions, we observe the sheath to be thinner, resulting in increased temperature, reduced magnetisation, and greater variability. Those differences could affect the dissipation of energy, that would eventually result in distinct observable radiative emission from high-resolution simulations. With higher resolutions, we can delve into crucial questions about horizon-scale physics and its impact on the dynamics and emission properties of larger-scale jets.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in externally FUV irradiated disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars are born in stellar clusters and their protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplaces of planets, can therefore be affected by the radiation of nearby massive stars. However, little is known about the chemistry of externally irradiated disks, including whether or not their properties are similar to the so-far better-studied isolated disks. Motivated by this question, we present ALMA Band 6 observations of two irradiated Class II protoplanetary disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to explore the chemical composition of disks exposed to (external) FUV radiation fields: the 216-0939 disk and the binary system 253-1536A/B, which are exposed to radiation fields of $10^2-10^3$ times the average interstellar radiation field. We detect lines from CO isotopologues, HCN, H$_2$CO, and C$_2$H toward both protoplanetary disks. Based on the observed disk-integrated line fluxes and flux ratios, we do not find significant differences between isolated and irradiated disks. The observed differences seem to be more closely related to the different stellar masses than to the external radiation field. This suggests that these disks are far enough away from the massive Trapezium stars, that their chemistry is no longer affected by external FUV radiation. Additional observations towards lower-mass disks and disks closer to the massive Trapezium stars are required to elucidate the level of external radiation required to make an impact on the chemistry of planet formation in different kinds of disks.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing at the galaxy scale is a valuable tool for various applications in astrophysics and cosmology. The primary uses of galaxy-scale lensing are to study elliptical galaxies' mass structure and evolution, constrain the stellar initial mass function, and measure cosmological parameters. Since the discovery of the first galaxy-scale lens in the 1980s, this field has made significant advancements in data quality and modeling techniques. In this review, we describe the most common methods for modeling lensing observables, especially imaging data, as they are the most accessible and informative source of lensing observables. We then summarize the primary findings from the literature on the astrophysical and cosmological applications of galaxy-scale lenses. We also discuss the current limitations of the data and methodologies and provide an outlook on the expected improvements in both areas in the near future.</description>

      <title>KAOSS: turbulent, but disc-like kinematics in dust-obscured star-forming galaxies at $z\sim$1.3-2.6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved kinematics of 27 ALMA-identified dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z\sim$1.3-2.6, as traced by H$\alpha$ emission using VLT/KMOS near-infrared integral field spectroscopy from the "KMOS-ALMA Observations of Submillimetre Sources" (KAOSS) Large Programme. We derive H$\alpha$ rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles for the DSFGs, and find that among the 27 sources with bright, spatially extended H$\alpha$ emission, 24 display evidence for disc-like kinematics. We measure a median inclination-corrected velocity at 2.2$R_{\rm d}$ of $v_{\rm rot}=$190$\pm$40kms$^{-1}$ and intrinsic velocity dispersion of $\sigma_0=$87$\pm$6kms$^{-1}$ for these disc-like sources. The kinematics yield median circular velocities of $v_{\rm circ}=$230$\pm$20kms$^{-1}$ and dynamical masses within 2$R_{\rm e}$ ($\sim$7kpc radius) of $M_{\rm dyn}=$(1.1$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$M$_\odot$. Compared to less actively star-forming galaxies, KAOSS DSFGs are both faster rotating with higher intrinsic velocity dispersions, but have similar $v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0$ ratios, median $v/\sigma_0=$2.5$\pm$0.5. We suggest that the kinematics of the DSFGs are primarily rotation supported but with a non-negligible contribution from pressure support, which may be driven by star formation or mergers/interactions. We estimate the normalisation of the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation (sTFR) for the disc-like DSFGs and compare it with local studies, finding no evolution at fixed slope between $z\sim$2 and $z\sim$0. Finally, we show that the kinematic properties of the DSFG population are consistent with them evolving into massive early-type galaxies, the dominant $z\sim$0 population at these masses.</description>

Abstract: We provide one of the most comprehensive metallicity studies at z $\sim$ 4 by analyzing the UV/optical HST photometry, and rest-frame VLT-FORS2 ultraviolet and VLT-XSHOOTER optical spectra of J0332-3557, a gravitationally lensed galaxy magnified by a factor of 20. With a 5$\sigma$ detection of the auroral O III]1666 line, we are able to derive a direct gas metallicity estimate for our target. We find Z_gas = 12 + log(O/H) = 8.26 $\pm$ 0.06, which is compatible with an increasing of both the gas fraction and the outflow metal loading factor from z $\sim$ 0 to z $\sim$ 4. J0332-3557 is the most metal-rich individual galaxy at z $\sim$ 4 for which the C/O ratio has been measured. We derive a low log(C/O) = - 1.02 $\pm$ 0.2, which suggests that J0332-3557 is in the early stages of ISM carbon enrichment driven mostly by massive stars. The low C/O abundance also indicates that J0332-3557 is characterized by a low star formation efficiency, higher yields of oxygen, and longer burst duration. We find that EW(C III])1906,9 is as low as $\sim$ 3 \AA. The main drivers of the low EW(C III])1906,9 are the higher gas metallicity and the low C/O abundance. J0332-3557 is characterized by one diffuse and two more compact regions $\sim$ 1 kpc in size. We find that the carbon emission mostly originates in the compact knots. Our study on J0332-3557 serves as an anchor for studies investigating the evolution of metallicity and C/O abundance across different redshifts.</description>

Abstract: Binary pulsars can be used to probe Galactic potential gradients through calculating their line-of-sight accelerations. We present the first data release of direct line-of-sight acceleration measurements for 29 binary pulsars. We validate these data with a local acceleration model, and compare our results to those from earlier works. We find evidence for an acceleration gradient in agreement with these values, with our results indicating a local disk density of $\rho_\mathrm{d} = 0.040_{-0.020}^{+0.020} \ \mathrm{M_\odot}\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$. We also find evidence for unmodeled noise of unknown origin in our data set.</description>

      <title>JWST/CEERS Sheds Light on Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies: Forming Bulges, Lopsidedness and Outside-In Quenching at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the morphology and resolved physical properties of a sample of 22 IR-selected DSFG at Cosmic Noon, using JWST NIRCam images obtained in the EGS field for the CEERS survey. The resolution of the NIRCam images allows us to spatially resolve these galaxies up to 4.4um and identify their bulge/core even when extinguished by dust. The goal of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the formation and evolution of FIR-bright galaxies by spatially resolving their properties, using JWST to look through the dust and bridge the gap between the compact FIR sources and the larger optical SFG. Based on RGB images using the NIRCam filters, we divide each galaxy in several uniformly colored regions, fit their respective SED and measure physical properties. After classifying each region as SF or quiescent, we assign galaxies to three classes, depending on whether active SF is located in the core, in the disk or in both. Results: (i) We find that the galaxies at higher z tend to have a fragmented disk with a low core mass fraction: they are at an early stage of bulge formation. When moving toward lower z, the core mass fraction increases, and the bulge growth is associated with a stabilization of the disk: NIRCam data clearly point towards bulge formation in pre-existing disks. (ii) Lopsidedness is a common feature of DSFGs, it could have a major impact on their evolution; (iii) 23% of galaxies have a SF core embedded in a quiescent disk, they seem to be undergoing outside-in quenching, often facilitated by their strong lopsidedness inducing instabilities; (iv) We show that half of our galaxies with star-formation concentrated in their core are good SMG counterpart candidates, demonstrating that compact SMGs are usually surrounded by a larger less obscured disk; and (v) we find surprising evidence for clump-like substructures being quiescent and/or residing in quiescent regions.</description>

      <title>The FENIKS Survey: Spectroscopic Confirmation of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z ~ 3-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measured ages of massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim 3-4$ imply that massive galaxies quench as early as $z\sim 6$. While the number of spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies at $z &lt; 3$ has increased over the years, there are only a handful at $z &gt; 3.5$. We report spectroscopic redshifts of one secure ($z=3.757$) and two tentative ($z = 3.336$, $z=4.673$) massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) &gt; 10.3$) quiescent galaxies with 11 hours of Keck/MOSFIRE $K$-band observations. Our candidates were selected from the FENIKS survey, which uses deep Gemini/Flamingos-2 $K_b$ $K_r$ imaging optimized for increased sensitivity to the characteristic red colors of galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ with strong Balmer/4000 \AA\ breaks. The rest-frame $UVJ$ and $(ugi)_s$ colors of 3/4 quiescent candidates are consistent with $1-2$ Gyr old stellar populations. This places these galaxies as the oldest objects at these redshifts, and challenges the notion that quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ are all recently-quenched, "post-starburst" galaxies. Our spectroscopy shows that the other quiescent-galaxy candidate is a broad-line AGN ($z = 3.594$) with strong, redshifted $H\beta$+[O III] emission with a velocity offset $&gt;1000$ km/s, indicative of a powerful outflow. The star-formation history of our highest redshift candidate suggests that its progenitor was already in place by $z \sim 7-11$, reaching $\sim$ 10$^{11} M_{\odot}$ by $z \simeq 8$. These observations reveal the limit of what is possible with deep near-infrared photometry and targeted spectroscopy from the ground and demonstrate that secure spectroscopic confirmation of quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 4$ is only feasible with JWST.</description>

      <title>Studying [CII] Emission in Low-mass Galaxies at z ~ 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a $\rm{[CII]}_{158\mu\rm{m}}$ search using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on three lensed, confirmed {\lya} emitting galaxies at $z \sim 7$. Our targets are ultra-violet (UV) faint systems with stellar masses on the order of $M_{*} \sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$. We detect a single [CII] line emission ($4\sigma$) from the brightest ($L \sim 2.4 \times 10^{10}L_{\odot}$) galaxy in our sample, MACS0454-1251. We determine a systemic redshift ($z_{\rm{[CII]}} = 6.3151 \pm 0.0005$) for MACS0454-1251 and measure a {\lya} velocity offset of $\Delta v \approx 300 \pm 70 \rm{km\,s}^{-1}$. The remaining two galaxies we detect no {\ct} but provide $3 \sigma$ upper limits on their {\ct} line luminosities which we use to investigate the $L_{\textrm{[CII]}} - \rm{SFR}$ relation. Overall our single {\ct} detection shows agreement with the relation for dwarf and local starburst galaxies. Our [CII] deficient galaxies could potentially be exhibiting low metallicities ($Z&lt;Z_{\odot}$). Another possible explanation for weaker [CII] emission could be strong feedback from star formation disrupting molecular clouds. We do not detect continuum emission in any of the sources, placing upper limits on their dust masses. Assuming a single dust temperature of $T_{d}=35 \rm{K}$ dust masses ($M_{\rm{dust}}$) range from $&lt; 4.8 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot} $ to $2.3 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$. Collectively, our results suggest faint reionization era sources could be metal poor and/or could have strong feedback suppressing [CII] emission.</description>

      <title>Characterising ultra-high-redshift dark matter halo demographics and assembly histories with the GUREFT simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halo demographics and assembly histories are a manifestation of cosmological structure formation and have profound implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. In particular, merger trees provide fundamental input for several modelling techniques, such as semi-analytic models (SAMs), sub-halo abundance matching (SHAM), and decorated halo occupation distribution models (HODs). Motivated by the new ultra-high-redshift (z &gt; 10) frontier enabled by JWST, we present a new suite of Gadget at Ultrahigh Redshift with Extra-Fine Timesteps (GUREFT) dark matter-only cosmological simulations that are carefully designed to capture halo merger histories and structural properties in the ultra-z universe. The simulation suite consists of four 1024^3-particle simulations with box sizes of 5, 15, 35, and 90 Mpc h-1, each with 170 snapshots stored between 40 &gt; z &gt; 6. With the unprecedented number of available snapshots and strategically chosen dynamic range covered by these boxes, gureft uncovers the emerging dark matter halo populations and their assembly histories in the earliest epochs of cosmic history. In this work, we present the halo mass functions between z ~ 20 to 6 down to log(Mvir/Msun) ~ 5, and show that at high redshift, these robust halo mass functions can differ substantially from commonly used analytic approximations or older fitting functions in the literature. We also present key physical properties of the ultra-z halo population, such as concentration and spin, as well as their mass growth and merger rates, and again provide updated fitting functions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the properties of Population III galaxies with multi-wavelength observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early Universe, spanning 400,000 to 400 million years after the Big Bang ($z\approx1100-11$), has been left largely unexplored as the light from luminous objects is too faint to be observed directly. While new experiments are pushing the redshift limit of direct observations, measurements in the low-frequency radio band promise to probe early star and black hole formation via observations of the hydrogen 21-cm line. In this work we explore synergies between 21-cm data from the HERA and SARAS 3 experiments and observations of the unresolved radio and X-ray backgrounds using multi-wavelength Bayesian analysis. We use the combined data set to constrain properties of Population II and Population III stars as well as early X-ray and radio sources. The joint fit reveals a 68 percentile disfavouring of Population III star formation efficiencies $\gtrsim5.7\%$. We also show how the 21-cm and the X-ray background data synergistically constrain opposite ends of the X-ray efficiency prior distribution to produce a peak in the 1D posterior of the X-ray luminosity per star formation rate. We find (at 68\% confidence) that early galaxies were likely 0.3 to 318 times as X-ray efficient as present-day starburst galaxies. We also show that the functional posteriors from our joint fit rule out global 21-cm signals deeper than $\lesssim-203\ \mathrm{mK}$ and power spectrum amplitudes at $k=0.34\ h\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$ greater than $\Delta_{21}^2 \gtrsim 946\ \mathrm{mK}^2$ with $3\sigma$ confidence.</description>

      <title>What Drives the Variability in AGN? Explaining the UV-Xray Disconnect Through Propagating Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensive broadband reverberation mapping campaigns have shown that AGN variability is significantly more complex than expected from disc reverberation of the variable X-ray illumination. The UV/optical variability is highly correlated and lagged, with longer lags at longer wavelengths as predicted, but the observed timescales are longer than expected. Worse, the UV/optical lightcurves are not well correlated with the X-rays which should drive them. Instead, we consider an intrinsically variable accretion disc, where slow mass accretion rate fluctuations are generated in the optical-UV disc, propagating down to modulate intrinsically faster X-ray variability from the central regions. We match our model to Fairall 9, a well studied AGN with $L \sim 0.1L_{\rm{Edd}}$, where the spectrum is dominated by the UV/EUV. Our model produces lightcurves where the X-rays and UV have very different fast variability, yet are well correlated on longer timescales, as observed. It predicts that the intrinsic variability has optical/UV leading the X-rays, but including reverberation of the variable EUV from an inner wind produces a lagged bound-free continuum which matches the observed UV-optical lags. We conclude that optical/UV AGN variability is likely driven by intrinsic fluctuations within the disc, not X-ray reprocessing: the observed longer than expected lags are produced by reverberation of the EUV illuminating a wind not by X-ray illumination of the disc: the increasing lag with increasing wavelength is produced by the increased contribution of the (constant lag) bound-free continuum to the spectrum, rather than indicating intrinsically larger reverberation distances for longer wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and acts as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution. We compute modifications to the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find a stochastic contribution which corresponds to a cosmological constant, anti-correlated with a contribution which has been used to fit galactic rotation curves without dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.</description>

      <title>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for $m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6}$ eV and limit axions with $-26 &lt; \log( m_{ax}/{eV}) &lt; -23$ to be less than $22\%$ of the DM (both limits at $95\%$ credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts $4 &lt; z &lt; 10$. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These high-$z$ measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-$z$ tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-$z$ galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming $\Lambda$CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos ($&lt; 10^9 M_\odot$) at $z &lt; 3$, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</description>
