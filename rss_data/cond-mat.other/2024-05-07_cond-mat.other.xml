      <title>Metallic mean fractal systems and their tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractals and quasiperiodic structures share self-similarity as a structural property. Motivated by the link between Fibonacci fractals and quasicrystals which are scaled by the golden mean ratio $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, we introduce and characterize a family of metallic-mean ratio fractals. We calculate the spatial properties of this generalized family, including their boundaries, which are also fractal. We then demonstrate how these fractals can be related to aperiodic tilings, and show how we can decorate them to produce new, fractal tilings.</description>

      <title>Two Toy Spin Chain Models of Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve for the decoherence dynamics of two models in which a simple qubit or Central Spin couples to a bath of spins; the bath is made from a chain of spins. In model 1, the bath spins are Ising spins; in Model 2, they are coupled by transverse spin-spin interactions, and the chain supports spin waves. We look at (i) the case where the Hamiltonian is static, with a constant system/bath coupling, and (ii) where this coupling varies in time.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic approach to reproduce multiple spinning vortices in horizontally rotating three-dimensional liquid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a rotating liquid, helium-4, using a two-fluid model with spin-angular momentum conservation. Our model was derived from the particle approximation of an inviscid fluid with residual viscosity. Despite the fully classical mechanical picture, the resulting system equations were consistent with those of the conventional two-fluid model. We consider bulk liquid helium-4 to be an inviscid fluid, assuming that the viscous fluid component remains at finite temperatures. As the temperature decreased, the amount of the viscous fluid component decreased, ultimately becoming a fully inviscid fluid at absolute zero. Weak compressibility is assumed to express the volume change because some helium atoms do not render fluid owing to BECs or change states because of local thermal excitation. One can solve the governing equations for an incompressible fluid using explicit SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), simultaneously reproducing density fluctuations and describing the fluid in a many-particle system. We assume the following fluid-particle duality: a hydrodynamic interfacial tension between the inviscid and viscous components or a local interaction force between two types of fluid particles. The former can be induced in the horizontal direction when non-negligible non-uniformity of the particles occurs during forced two-dimensional rotation, and the latter is non-negligible when the former is negligible. We performed a largescale simulation of 3D liquid helium forced to rotate horizontally using 32 GPUs. Compared with the low-resolution calculation using 2.4 million particles, the high-resolution calculation using 19.6 million particles showed spinning vortices close to those of the theoretical solution. We obtained a promising venue to establish a practical simulation method for bulk liquid helium-4.</description>
