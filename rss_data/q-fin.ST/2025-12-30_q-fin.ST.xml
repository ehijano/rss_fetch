      <title>Broken Symmetry of Stock Returns -- a Modified Jones-Faddy Skew t-Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that negative skew and positive mean of the distribution of stock returns are largely due to the broken symmetry of stochastic volatility governing gains and losses. Starting with stochastic differential equations for stock returns and for stochastic volatility we argue that the distribution of stock returns can be effectively split in two -- for gains and losses -- assuming difference in parameters of their respective stochastic volatilities. A modified Jones-Faddy skew t-distribution utilized here allows to reflect this in a single organic distribution which tends to meaningfully capture this asymmetry. We illustrate its application on distribution of daily S&amp;P500 returns, including analysis of its tails.</description>

      <title>Inferring Latent Market Forces: Evaluating LLM Detection of Gamma Exposure Patterns via Obfuscation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce obfuscation testing, a novel methodology for validating whether large language models detect structural market patterns through causal reasoning rather than temporal association. Testing three dealer hedging constraint patterns (gamma positioning, stock pinning, 0DTE hedging) on 242 trading days (95.6% coverage) of S&amp;P 500 options data, we find LLMs achieve 71.5% detection rate using unbiased prompts that provide only raw gamma exposure values without regime labels or temporal context. The WHO-WHOM-WHAT causal framework forces models to identify the economic actors (dealers), affected parties (directional traders), and structural mechanisms (forced hedging) underlying observed market dynamics. Critically, detection accuracy (91.2%) remains stable even as economic profitability varies quarterly, demonstrating that models identify structural constraints rather than profitable patterns. When prompted with regime labels, detection increases to 100%, but the 71.5% unbiased rate validates genuine pattern recognition. Our findings suggest LLMs possess emergent capabilities for detecting complex financial mechanisms through pure structural reasoning, with implications for systematic strategy development, risk management, and our understanding of how transformer architectures process financial market dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Economic Index &amp; The State Switching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing empirical literature suggests that equity-premium predictability is state dependent, with much of the forecasting power concentrated around recessionary periods (Henkel et al., 2011; Dangl and Halling, 2012; Devpura et al., 2018). I study U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document strong evidence of time-varying expected returns across both expansionary and contractionary states. I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by Welch and Goyal (2008), improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS). Under the state-switching model, the Aligned Economic Index exhibits statistically and economically significant predictive power in sample and out of sample, and it outperforms widely used benchmark predictors and alternative predictor-combination methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Synthetic Financial Data: Applications to Portfolio and Risk Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic financial data provides a practical solution to the privacy, accessibility, and reproducibility challenges that often constrain empirical research in quantitative finance. This paper investigates the use of deep generative models, specifically Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate realistic synthetic financial return series for portfolio construction and risk modeling applications. Using historical daily returns from the S and P 500 as a benchmark, we generate synthetic datasets under comparable market conditions and evaluate them using statistical similarity metrics, temporal structure tests, and downstream financial tasks. The study shows that TimeGAN produces synthetic data with distributional shapes, volatility patterns, and autocorrelation behaviour that are close to those observed in real returns. When applied to mean--variance portfolio optimization, the resulting synthetic datasets lead to portfolio weights, Sharpe ratios, and risk levels that remain close to those obtained from real data. The VAE provides more stable training but tends to smooth extreme market movements, which affects risk estimation. Finally, the analysis supports the use of synthetic datasets as substitutes for real financial data in portfolio analysis and risk simulation, particularly when models are able to capture temporal dynamics. Synthetic data therefore provides a privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for financial experimentation and model development.</description>
