      <title>Orlicz-Schatten Factorizations for Non-Commutative Sobolev Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for factorizing embeddings of non-commutative Sobolev spaces on quantum tori through newly defined Orlicz-Schatten sequence ideals. After introducing appropriate non-commutative Sobolev norms and Orlicz spectral conditions, we establish a summing operator characterization of the quantum Laplacian embedding. Our main results provide both existence and optimality of such factorization theorems, and highlight connections to operator ideal theory. Applications to regularity of non-commutative PDEs and quantum information metrics are discussed, demonstrating the broad impact of these structures in functional analysis and mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Convergence Properties of Finite Free Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite free convolutions, $\boxplus_d$ and $\boxtimes_d$, are binary operations on polynomials of degree $d$ that are central to finite free probability, a developing field at the intersection of free probability and the geometry of polynomials. Motivated by established regularities in free probability, this paper investigates analogous regularities for finite free convolutions. Key findings include triangle inequalities for these convolutions and necessary and sufficient conditions regarding atoms of probability measures. Applications of these results include proving the weak convergence of $\boxplus_d$ and $\boxtimes_d$ to their infinite counterparts $\boxplus$ and $\boxtimes$ as $d \to \infty$, without compactness assumptions. Furthermore, this weak convergence is strengthened to convergence in Kolmogorov distance.</description>

      <title>Operator $K$-theoretic analysis of random adjacency matrices</title>

Abstract: We appeal to results from combinatorial random matrix theory to deduce that various random graph $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras are asymptotically almost surely Kirchberg algebras with trivial $K_1$. This in particular implies that, with high probability, the stable isomorphism classes of such algebras are exhausted by variations of Cuntz algebras that we term 'Cuntz polygons'. These probabilistically generic algebras can be assembled into a Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} class whose limit structure $\mathbb{G}$ is consequently relevant to any $K$-theoretic analysis of finite graph $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We also use computer simulations to experimentally verify the behaviour predicted by theory and to estimate the asymptotic probabilities of obtaining stable isomorphism classes represented by actual Cuntz algebras. These probabilities depend on the frequencies with which the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $K_0$ are cyclic and in some cases can be computed from existing theory. For random symmetric $r$-regular multigraphs, current theory can describe these frequencies for finite sets of odd primes $p$ not dividing $r-1$. A novel aspect of the collected data is the observation of new heuristics outside of this case, leading to a conjecture for the asymptotic probability of these graphs yielding $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras stably isomorphic to Cuntz algebras. For other models of random multigraphs including Bernoulli (di)graphs, the data also allow us to estimate and heuristically explain the (surprisingly high) asymptotic probabilities of exact isomorphism to a Cuntz algebra. Recognising the role played by Cuntz--Krieger algebras in the theory of symbolic dynamics, we also collect supplemental data to estimate (and in some cases, actually compute) the asymptotic probability of a random subshift of finite type being flow equivalent to a full shift.</description>
