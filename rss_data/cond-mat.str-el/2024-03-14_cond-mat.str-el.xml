      <title>Noncentrosymmetric Triangular Magnet CaMnTeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Role of s0 vs. s2 Electronic States in Competing Exchange Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric triangular magnets offer a unique platform for realizing strong quantum fluctuations. However, designing these quantum materials remains an open challenge attributable to a knowledge gap in the tunability of competing exchange interactions at the atomic level. Here, we create a new noncentrosymmetric triangular S = 3/2 magnet CaMnTeO6 based on careful chemical and physical considerations. The model material displays competing magnetic interactions and features nonlinear optical responses with the capability of generating coherent photons. The incommensurate magnetic ground state of CaMnTeO6 with an unusually large spin rotation angle of 127 deg.(1) indicates that the anisotropic interlayer exchange is strong and competing with the isotropic interlayer Heisenberg interaction. The moment of 1.39(1) {\mu}B, extracted from low-temperature heat capacity and neutron diffraction measurements, is only 46% of the expected value of the static moment 3 {\mu}B. This reduction indicates the presence of strong quantum fluctuations in the half-integer spin S = 3/2 CaMnTeO6 magnet, which is rare. By comparing the spin-polarized band structure, chemical bonding, and physical properties of AMnTeO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Pb), we demonstrate how quantum-chemical interpretation can illuminate insights into the fundamentals of magnetic exchange interactions, providing a powerful tool for modulating spin dynamics with atomically precise control.</description>

      <title>Dipolar BF theory and dipolar braiding statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recently proposed dipolar BF theory with couplings to charge and dipole currents. The quasiparticles of the theory are either charge-like or dipole-like, and the mutual braiding statistics between charge-like and dipole-like quasiparticles are dipolar, meaning that it depends on the position of the quasiparticle being encircled. The braiding statistics between two dipole-like quasiparticles is that of ordinary anyons. We further prove that the dipolar BF theory is equivalent to the rank-2 tensor BF theory developed earlier as an effective theory for the rank-2 toric code. Although the two theories are equivalent, the dipolar BF formulation embodies the dipole symmetry explicitly and gives a clean insight into the way the dipole symmetry manifests itself in various conservation laws and the dipolar braiding statistics.</description>

      <title>RKKY Interactions and Multipole Order in Ab initio Wannier Model of CeCoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the RKKY interactions derived from ab initio calculations for the intermetallic compound CeCoSi exhibiting the hidden nonmagnetic order at $T_0$ and examine the instability towards possible multipole orders within the random phase approximation. All 36 multipole interactions up to rank 5 are investigated, and the maximum susceptibility exhibits an antiferro order with $\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{0}$ for nonmagnetic multipoles of monopole $I$ and hexadecapole $H_{0}$, yielding a charge imbalance of $f$ electrons at two Ce atoms in the unit cell, which is consistent with some experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin state and nematic ferromagnet in the spin-1 Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher-spin Kitaev magnets, in which the Kitaev interaction and off-diagonal exchange couplings are overwhelmingly large, have emerged as a fertile avenue to explore exotic phases and unusual excitations. In this work, we study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-1 Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model on the honeycomb lattice using density-matrix renormalization group. It harbours six distinct phases and the intriguing findings are three magnetically ordered phases in which both time-reversal symmetry and lattice symmetry albeit of different sort are broken spontaneously. The chiral spin state originates from the order-by-disorder effect and exhibits an almost saturated scalar spin chirality at the quantum level. Depending on the relative strength of the two interactions, it also features columnar or plaquette valence-bond-solid-like pattern as a consequence of the translational symmetry breaking. In parallel, the nematic ferromagnets are situated at ferromagnetic Kitaev side and possess small but finite ferromagnetic ordering. The lattice-rotational symmetry breaking enforces nonequivalent bond energy along one of the three bonds. Although the intrinsic difference between the two nematic ferromagnets remains elusive, the discontinuities in the von Neumann entropy, hexagonal plaquette operator, and Wilson loop operator convincingly suggest that they are separated via a first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Layered Kagome Compound Na$_2$Ni$_3$S$_4$ with Topological Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report structural and electronic properties of Na$_2$Ni$_3$S$_4$, a quasi-two-dimensional compound composed of alternating layers of [Ni$_3$S$_4$]$^{2-}$ and Na$^{+}$. The compound features a remarkable Ni-based kagome lattice with a square planar configuration of four surrounding S atoms for each Ni atom. Magnetization and electrical measurements reveal a weak paramagnetic insulator with a gap of about 0.5 eV. Our band structure calculation highlights a set of topological flat bands of the kagome lattice derived from the rotated d$_{xz}$-orbital with $C_\mathrm{3}$ + $T$ symmetry in the presence of crystal-field splitting.</description>

      <title>The Heisenberg-RIXS instrument at the European XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is an ideal X-ray spectroscopy method to push the combination of energy and time resolutions to the Fourier transform ultimate limit, because it is unaffected by the core-hole lifetime energy broadening. And in pump-probe experiments the interaction time is made very short by the same core-hole lifetime. RIXS is very photon hungry so it takes great advantage from high repetition rate pulsed X-ray sources like the European XFEL. The hRIXS instrument is designed for RIXS experiments in the soft X-ray range with energy resolution approaching the Fourier and the Heisenberg limits. It is based on a spherical grating with variable line spacing (VLS) and a position-sensitive 2D detector. Initially, two gratings are installed to adequately cover the whole photon energy range. With optimized spot size on the sample and small pixel detector the energy resolution can be better than 40 meV at any photon energy below 1000 eV. At the SCS instrument of the European XFEL the spectrometer can be easily positioned thanks to air-pads on a high-quality floor, allowing the scattering angle to be continuously adjusted over the 65-145 deg range. It can be coupled to two different sample interaction chamber, one for liquid jets and one for solids, each equipped at the state-of-the-art and compatible for optical laser pumping in collinear geometry. The measured performances, in terms of energy resolution and count rate on the detector, closely match design expectations. hRIXS is open to public users since the summer of 2022.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect incorporating magnon damping in localized spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theory for thermal Hall transport mediated by magnons to address the impact of their damping resulting from magnon-magnon interactions in insulating magnets. This phenomenon is anticipated to be particularly significant in systems characterized by strong quantum fluctuations, exemplified by spin-1/2 systems. Employing a nonlinear flavor-wave theory, we analyze a general model for localized electron systems and develop a formulation for thermal conductivity based on a perturbation theory, utilizing bosonic Green's functions with a nonzero self-energy. We derive the expression of the thermal Hall conductivity incorporating magnon damping. To demonstrate the applicability of the obtained representation, we adopt it to two $S=1/2$ quantum spin models on a honeycomb lattice. In calculations for these systems, we make use of the self-consistent imaginary Dyson equation approach at finite temperatures for evaluating the magnon damping rate. In both systems, the thermal Hall conductivity is diminished due to the introduction of magnon damping over a wide temperature range. This effect arises due to the smearing of magnon spectra with nonzero Berry curvatures. We also discuss the relation to the damping of chiral edge modes of magnons. Our formulation can be applied to various localized electron systems as we begin with a general Hamiltonian for these systems. Our findings shed light on a new aspect of topological magnonics emergent from many-body effects and will stimulate further investigations on the impact of magnon damping on topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application to search for new magnetic ground states in the Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed and its superiority over standard particle swarm optimization algorithm is tested on two typical benchmark functions. By employing this algorithm to search for the magnetic ground states of the Hubbard model on the real-space square lattice with finite size based on the mean-field approximation, two new magnetic states, namely the double striped-type antiferromagnetic state and the triple antiferromagnetic state, are found. We further perform mean-field calculations in the thermodynamical limit to confirm that these two new magnetic states are not a result of a finite-size effect, where the properties of the double striped-type antiferromagnetic state are also presented.</description>

      <title>Room temperature charge density wave in a tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5 and study of its origin in the R2T3X5 (R = Rare earth, T = transition metal, X = Si, Ge) series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) systems are proposed to exhibit application potential for electronic and optoelectronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials that exhibit a CDW state at room temperature is crucial for the development of CDW-based devices. Here, we present a non-layered tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5, which exhibits a CDW state at room temperature. Gd2Os3Si5 crystallizes in the U2Mn3Si5-type tetragonal crystal structure with the space group P4/mnc. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis shows that Gd2Os3Si5 possesses an incommensurately modulated structure with modulation wave vector q = (0.53, 0, 0), while the modulation reduces the symmetry to orthorhombic Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0. This differs in contrast to isostructural Sm2Ru3Ge5, where the modulated phase has been reported to possess the superspace symmetry Pm({\alpha} 0 {\gamma})0. However, reinvestigation of Sm2Ru3Ge5 suggests that its modulated crystal structure can alternatively be described by Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0, with modulations similar to Gd2Os3Si5. The magnetic susceptibility, \c{hi}(T), exhibits a maximum at low temperatures that indicates an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 5.5 K. The \c{hi}(T) furthermore shows an anomaly at around 345 K, suggesting a CDW transition at TCDW = 345 K, that corroborates the result from high-temperature SXRD measurements. Interestingly, R2T3X5 compounds are known to crystallize either in the tetragonal Sc2Fe3Si5 type structure or in the orthorhombic U2Co3Si5 structure type. Not all of the compounds in the R2T3X5 series undergo CDW phase transitions. We find that R2T3X5 compounds will exhibit a CDW transition, if the condition : 0.526 &lt; c/sqrt(ab) &lt; 0.543 is satisfied. We suggest the wave vector-dependent electron-phonon coupling to be the dominant mechanism of CDW formation in the tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic ordering and glassy nature in NASICON type NaFe$_2$PO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate crystal structure and magnetic properties including spin relaxation and magnetocaloric effect in NASICON type NaFe$_2$PO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_2$ sample. The Rietveld refinement of x-ray and neutron diffraction patterns show a rhombohedral crystal structure with the R$\bar{3}$c space group. The core-level spectra confirm the desired oxidation state of constituent elements. The {\it dc}--magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) behavior in zero field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) modes show the ordering temperature $\approx$50~K. Interestingly, the analysis of temperature dependent neutron diffraction patterns reveal an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure with the ordered moment of 3.8 $\mu_{B}$/Fe$^{3+}$ at 5~K, and a magnetostriction below $T_{\rm N}=$ 50~K. Further, the peak position in the {\it ac}--$\chi$ is found to be invariant with the excitation frequency supporting the notion of dominating AFM transition. Also, the unsaturated isothermal magnetization curve supports the AFM ordering of the moments; however, the observed coercivity suggests the presence of weak ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at 5~K. On the other hand, a clear bifurcation between ZFC and FC curves of {\it dc}--$\chi$ and the observed decrease in peak height of {\it ac}--$\chi$ with frequency suggest for the complex magnetic interactions. The spin relaxation behavior in thermo-remanent magnetization and aging measurements indicate the glassy states at 5~K. Moreover, the Arrott plots and magnetocaloric analysis reveal the AFM--FM interactions in the sample at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model for arbitrary spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the spin functional renormalization group to investigate the $J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model on a square lattice. By incorporating sum rules associated with the fixed length of the spin operators as well as the nontrivial quantum dynamics implied by the spin algebra, we are able to compute the ground state phase diagram for arbitrary spin $S$, including the quantum paramagnetic phase at strong frustration. Our prediction for the extent of this paramagnetic region for $ S = 1/2 $ agrees well with other approaches that are computationally more expensive. We find that the quantum paramagnetic phase disappears for $ S \gtrsim 5 $ due to the suppression of quantum fluctuations with increasing $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider electron pairing in a two-dimensional thermally disordered itinerant anti-ferromagnet. It is shown that transverse spin fluctuations in such a state can give rise to superconductivity with a sizeable critical temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ there is quasi-long-range spin-singlet and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting order, together with fluctuating triplet order at momentum $(\pi,\pi)$. The singlet pairs we find are tightly bound together, and the pair wavefunction has a purely inter-sublattice structure due to the U(1) spin rotation symmetry of the anti-ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect in a van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CrI3 is a prototypical van der Waals ferromagnet with a magnetic honeycomb lattice. Previous inelastic neutron scattering studies have suggested topological nature of its magnetic excitations with a magnon gap at the Dirac points, which are anticipated to give rise to magnon thermal Hall effect. Here we report thermal transport properties of CrI3 and show that the long-sought thermal Hall signal anticipated for topological magnons is fairly small. In contrast, we find that CrI3 exhibits an appreciable anomalous thermal Hall signal at lower temperature which may arise from magnon-phonon hybridization or magnon-phonon scattering. These findings are anticipated to stimulate further neutron scattering studies on CrI3 single crystal, which can shed light not only on the intrinsic nature of magnetic excitations but also on the magnon-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Zero modes of velocity field and topological invariant in quantum torus</title>

Abstract: We propose the velocity field approach to characterize topological invariants of quantum states. We introduce the indexes of the velocity field flow based on the zero modes of the velocity field and find that these zero modes play the role of effective topological charges or defects linking to Euler characteristic by the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem. The global property of the indexes is topological invariants against the parameter deformation. We demonstrate this approach by the quantum torus model and compare the topological invariant with that obtained from the Chern number. We find that the physical mechanism of the topological invariant based on the zero modes of the velocity field is different from that of the topological invariant by the Chern number. The topological invariant characterized by the velocity field describes a homeomorphic topological invariant associated with the zero modes on the submanifold of the base manifold of the SU(2)-fibre bundle for quantum torus, whereas the Chern number characterizes a homotopy invariant associated with the exceptional points in the Brillouin zone. We also propose the generalized winding number in terms of the velocity field for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. This gives a connection between the zero mode and winding number in the velocity space. These results enrich the topological invariants of quantum states and promises us a novel insight to understanding topological invariants of quantum states as well as expected to be further applied in more generic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we extend the idea of the meanfield. Meanfields approximately map - through some self consistency relation - a complex, usually manybody, problem to a simpler more readily solvable problem. Prototypical examples of simpler meanfield problem (meanfield systems) are the single site and free particle problems - which are solvable. Here we propose a new class of simple meanfield systems where the simple problem to be solved is a 1D spin chain. These meanfields are particularly useful for studying quasi-1D models. We illustrate this idea by considering meanfields for the Ising and ferromagnetic Heisenberg models with one direction coupled much more strongly then the other directions (quasi-1D systems) which map at meanfield level onto the 1D Ising and 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg models. Magnetic phase transition temperatures and are obtained for both models.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epitaxial growth of thin-film heterostructures is generally considered the most successful procedure to obtain interfaces of excellent structural and electronic quality between three-dimensional materials. However, these interfaces can only join material systems with crystal lattices of matching symmetries and lattice constants. We present a novel category of interfaces, the fabrication of which is membrane-based and does not require epitaxial growth. These interfaces therefore overcome limitations imposed by epitaxy. Leveraging the additional degrees of freedom gained, we demonstrate atomically clean interfaces between three-fold symmetric sapphire and four-fold symmetric SrTiO3. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals structurally well-defined interfaces with a novel moir\'e-type reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole asymmetry of quantum collective excitations in high-$T_c$ copper oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of collective spin- and charge excitations for the canonical single-band Hubbard, $t$-$J$-$U$, and $t$-$J$ models of high-temperature copper-oxide superconductors, both on electron- and hole-doped side of the phase diagram. Recently developed variational wave function approach, combined with the expansion in inverse number of fermionic flavors, is employed. All three models exhibit a substantial electron-hole asymmetry of magnetic excitations, with a robust paramagnon emerging for hole-doping, in agreement with available resonant inelastic $x$-ray scattering data for the cuprates. The $t$-$J$ model yields additional high-energy peak in the magnetic spectrum that is not unambiguously identified in spectroscopy. For all considered Hamiltonians, the dynamical charge susceptibility contains a coherent mode for both hole- and electron doping, with overall bandwidth renormalization controlled by the on-site Coulomb repulsion. Away from the strong-coupling limit, the antiferromagnetic ordering tendency is more pronounced on electron-doped side of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Strongly Interacting Phases in Twisted Bilayer Graphene at the Magic Angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle is known to have a cascade of insulating phases at integer filling factors of the low-energy bands. In this Letter we address the nature of these phases through an unrestricted, large-scale Hartree-Fock calculation on the lattice that self-consistently accounts for all electronic bands. Using numerically unbiased methods, we show that Coulomb interactions produce ferromagnetic insulating states at integer fillings $\nu\in[-3,3]$ with maximal spin polarization $M_{\text{FM}}=4-|\nu|$. We find that the $\nu=0$ state is a pure ferromagnet, whereas all other insulating states are spin-valley polarized. At odd filling factors $|\nu|=1,3$ those states have a quantum anomalous Hall effect with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. Except for the $\nu=0,-2$ states, all other integer fillings have insulating phases with additional sublattice symmetry breaking and antiferromagnetism in the remote bands. We map the metal-insulator transitions of these phases as a function of the effective dielectric constant. Our results establish the importance of large-scale lattice calculations to faithfully determine the ground states of TBG at integer fillings.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Wave Ordering in NdNiO$_2$: Effects of Multiorbital Nonlocal Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate collective electronic fluctuations and, in particular, the possibility of the charge density wave ordering in an infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$. We perform advanced many-body calculations for the ab-initio three-orbital model by taking into account local correlation effects, non-local charge and magnetic fluctuations, and the electron-phonon coupling. We find that in the considered material, electronic correlations are strongly orbital- and momentum-dependent. Notably, the charge density wave and magnetic instabilities originate from distinct orbitals. In particular, we show that the correlation effects lead to the momentum-dependent hybridization between different orbitals, resulting in the splitting and shifting of the flat part of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ band. This strong renormalization of the electronic spectral function drives the charge density wave instability that is related to the intraband Ni-$d_{z^2}$ correlations. Instead, the magnetic instability stems from the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which remains half-filled through the redistribution of the electronic density between different bands even upon hole doping. Consequently, the strength of the magnetic fluctuations remains nearly unchanged for the considered doping levels. We argue that this renormalization is not inherent to the stoichiometric case but can be induced by hole doping.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic skyrmion and multi-$q$ spin dynamics in centrosymmetric Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions are particle-like vortices of magnetization with non-trivial topology, which are usually stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in noncentrosymmetric bulk materials. Exceptions are centrosymmetric Gd- and Eu-based skyrmion-lattice (SkL) hosts with net-zero DMI, where both the SkL stabilization mechanisms and magnetic ground states remain controversial. We address these by investigating both static and dynamic spin properties of the centrosymmetric SkL host Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ using muon spectroscopy ($\mu$SR). We find that spin fluctuations in its non-coplanar SkL phase are highly anisotropic, implying that spin anisotropy plays a prominent role in stabilizing this phase. We also observe strongly-anisotropic spin dynamics in the ground-state (IC-1) incommensurate magnetic phase of the material, indicating that it is a meron-like multi-$q$ structure. In contrast, the higher-field, coplanar IC-2 phase is found to be single-$q$ with nearly-isotropic spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed study of the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of a garnet compound Mn$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{12}$ is carried out using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron diffraction measurements as well as \textit{ab initio} band-structure calculations. This compound manifests two successive magnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 4.5$ K and $T_{\rm N2} \simeq 2.7$ K. Neutron powder diffraction experiments reveal that these two transitions correspond to the collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnetic ordering of the nonfrustrated Cr$^{3+}$ and frustrated Mn$^{2+}$ sublattices, respectively. The interactions within each of the Cr and Mn sublattices are antiferromagnetic, while the inter-sublattice interactions are ferromagnetic. The $H-T$ phase diagram is quite complex and displays multiple phases under magnetic field, which can be attributed to the frustrated nature of the spin lattice. Mn$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{12}$ shows a large magnetocaloric effect with a maximum value of isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_{\rm m} \simeq -23$ J/kg-K and adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{\rm ad} \simeq 9$ K for a field change of 7 T. Further, a large value of the relative cooling power ($RCP \simeq 360$ J/kg) demonstrates the promise of using this compound in magnetic refrigeration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of topologically-ordered phases of matter to encode and process quantum information forms the cornerstone of many approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate that fault-tolerant logical operations in these approaches can be interpreted as instances of anyon condensation. We present a constructive theory for anyon condensation and, in tandem, illustrate our theory explicitly using the color-code model. We show that different condensation processes are associated with a general class of domain walls, which can exist in both space- and time-like directions. This class includes semi-transparent domain walls that condense certain subsets of anyons. We use our theory to classify topological objects and design novel fault-tolerant logic gates for the color code. As a final example, we also argue that dynamical `Floquet codes' can be viewed as a series of condensation operations. We propose a general construction for realising planar dynamically driven codes based on condensation operations on the color code. We use our construction to introduce a new Calderbank-Shor Steane-type Floquet code that we call the Floquet color code.</description>

      <title>Defining an universal "sign" to strictly probe phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and frustrated systems. A recent work [Science \textbf{375}, 418 (2022)] made a remarkable breakthrough in the sign problem by pointing out that the sign can be used to probe phase transition. In this work, we proposed a general argument based on the definition of the sign that is related to the difference in free energy between the original and reference systems to clarify that the sign problem and phase transition cannot always be strictly related. The sign can exactly probe phase transition only if the free energy in the reference system is flat under variable parameters, which is almost impossible to design. Generally speaking, the conclusion that the sign can probe phase transition is survivorship bias without universality. To solve this problem, we define a modified sign that excludes the influence of the reference system, which can probe the phase transition strictly. The work gives an unbiased solution for detecting phase transition by the new modified sign.</description>

      <title>From the XXZ chain to the integrable Rydberg-blockade ladder via non-invertible duality defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14081v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting models often possess "dualities" subtler than a one-to-one mapping of energy levels. The maps can be non-invertible, as apparent in the canonical example of Kramers and Wannier. We analyse an algebraic structure common to the XXZ spin chain and three other models: Rydberg-blockade bosons with one particle per square of a ladder, a three-state antiferromagnet, and two Ising chains coupled in a zigzag fashion. The structure yields non-invertible maps between the four models while also guaranteeing all are integrable. We construct these maps explicitly utilising topological defects coming from fusion categories and the lattice version of the orbifold construction, and use them to give explicit conformal-field-theory partition functions describing their critical regions. The Rydberg and Ising ladders also possess interesting non-invertible symmetries, with the spontaneous breaking of one in the former resulting in an unusual ground-state degeneracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying paradigm for analyzing and constructing topological quantum error correcting codes as dynamical circuits of geometrically local channels and measurements. To this end, we relate such circuits to discrete fixed-point path integrals in Euclidean spacetime, which describe the underlying topological order: If we fix a history of measurement outcomes, we obtain a fixed-point path integral carrying a pattern of topological defects. As an example, we show that the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, and CSS Floquet code can be viewed as one and the same code on different spacetime lattices, and the honeycomb Floquet code is equivalent to the CSS Floquet code under a change of basis. We also use our formalism to derive two new error-correcting codes, namely a Floquet version of the $3+1$-dimensional toric code using only 2-body measurements, as well as a dynamic code based on the double-semion string-net path integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arising from the extreme/saddle point in electronic bands, Van Hove singularity (VHS) manifests divergent density of states (DOS) and induces various new states of matter such as unconventional superconductivity. VHS is believed to exist in one and two dimensions, but rarely found in three dimension (3D). Here, we report the discovery of 3D VHS in a topological magnet EuCd2As2 by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. External magnetic fields effectively control the exchange interaction in EuCd2As2, and shift 3D Weyl bands continuously, leading to the modification of Fermi velocity and energy dispersion. Above the critical field, the 3D VHS forms and is evidenced by the abrupt emergence of inter-band transitions, which can be quantitatively described by the minimal model of Weyl semimetals. Three additional optical transitions are further predicted theoretically and verified in magneto-near-infrared spectra. Our results pave the way to exploring VHS in 3D systems and uncovering the coordination between electronic correlation and the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics approach to dynamical quantum phase transitions: the Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces complex dynamics methods to study dynamical quantum phase transitions in the one- and two-dimensional quantum 3-state Potts model. The quench involves switching off an infinite transverse field. The time-dependent Loschmidt echo is evaluated by an exact renormalization group (RG) transformation in the complex plane where the thermal Boltzmann factor is along the positive real axis, and the quantum time evolution is along the unit circle. One of the characteristics of the complex dynamics constituted by repeated applications of RG is the Julia set, which determines the phase transitions. We show that special boundary conditions can alter the nature of the transitions, and verify the claim for the one-dimensional system by transfer matrix calculations. In two dimensions, there are alternating symmetry-breaking and restoring transitions, both of which are first-order, despite the criticality of the Curie point. In addition, there are finer structures because of the fractal nature of the Julia set. Our approach can be extended to multi-variable problems, higher dimensions, and approximate RG transformations expressed as rational functions.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Ramped Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition</title>

Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a periodically driven extended XY model, in the presence of linear time dependent magnetic filed, is investigated using the notion of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). Along the similar lines to the equilibrium phase transition, the main purpose of this work is to search the fundamental concepts such as scaling and universality at the ramped quench DQPTs. We have shown that the critical points of the model, where the gap closing occurs, can be moved by tuning the driven frequency and consequently the presence/absence of DQPTs can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the driven frequency. %Taking advantage of this property, We have uncovered that, for a ramp across the single quantum critical point, the critical mode at which DQPTs occur is classified into three regions: the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) region, where the critical mode scales linearly with the square root of the sweep velocity, pre-saturated (PS) region, and the saturated (S) region where the critical mode makes a plateau versus the sweep velocity. While for a ramp that crosses two critical points, the critical modes disclose just KZ and PS regions. On the basis of numerical simulations, we find that the dynamical free energy scales linerly with time, as approaches to DQPT time, with the exponent $\nu=1\pm 0.01$ for all sweep velocities and driven frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the dominant pairing instability (intraorbital $s$-wave/interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, or $s \pm$-wave in a bonding-antibonding basis) is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>A new quantum hydrodynamic description of ferroelectricity in spiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity was found in rare earth manganites, where the electric polarization could be induced by special magnetic ordering. There is no theoretical model that would allow us to study the static and dynamic properties of electric polarization in strongly correlated magnetic dielectrics. In the presented research, we have taken the main step towards the construction of such a fundamental model, and made a direct connection between the microscopic Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky theory and Mostovoy's phenomenological model for magnetically induced polarization. A novel description of the ferroelectricity of spin origin is proposed within the framework of the many-particle quantum hydrodynamics method. It is applied to the study of cells of magnetic ions, where the electric dipole moment is proportional to the vector product of spins. Our approach is based on the many-particle Pauli equation, where the influence of an external magnetic field is considered. We define the electric dipole moment operator of the ion cell and introduce the macroscopic polarization as the quantum mechanical average of that operator. We formulate a model for the description of nonequilibrium polarization and derive a new polarization evolution equation. The polarization switching in ferroelectric magnets with the spiral spin-density-wave state is considered, and we demonstrate that the proposed model yields known results and can predict novel effects. The dynamic magnetoelectric effect can be investigated by employing this novel equation to study the evolution of polarization.</description>
