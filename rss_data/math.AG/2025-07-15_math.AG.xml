      <title>Construction of minimal varieties from quasi-smooth weighted complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the generalization of the construction of minimal varieties from the previous work of Meng Chen, Chen Jiang and Binru Li. We first establish several effective nefness criterions for the canonical divisor of weighted blow-ups over a weighted complete intersection, we both consider the high codimensional case and the blowing up several points case, from which we construct plenty of new minimal $3$-folds including $79$ families of minimal $3$-folds of general type, several infinite series of minimal $3$-folds of Kodaira dimension $2$, $16$ families of minimal $3$-folds of general type on or near the Noether lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weight-graded compactly supported cohomology of the moduli spaces of curves $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ using the Getzler-Kapranov graph complex. After recollecting the theory and some previous results, we compute the cohomology in weight 13 for the (g, n) pairs with 3g + 2n = 28.</description>

      <title>Gorenstein singularities with $\mathbb{G}_m$-action and moduli spaces of holomorphic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a holomorphic differential on a smooth curve, we associate to it a Gorenstein singularity with $\mathbb{G}_m$-action via a test configuration. This construction decomposes the strata of holomorphic differentials into negatively graded versal deformation spaces of such singularities, refining Pinkham's correspondence between monomial singularities and Weierstrass semigroups to the case of Gorenstein singularities with multiple branches in the framework of Looijenga's deformations with good $\mathbb{G}_m$-action. Additionally, this construction provides a natural description for the singular curves that appear in the boundary of the versal deformation spaces, generalizing various special cases from symmetric semigroups and local complete intersections to arbitrary Gorenstein curves that admit canonical divisors with prescribed orders of zeros. Our construction provides a uniform approach to describe the resulting singularities and their invariants, such as weights and characters, initially studied by Alper--Fedorchuk--Smyth. As an application, we classify the unique Gorenstein singularity with $\mathbb{G}_m$-action for each nonvarying stratum of holomorphic differentials in the work of Chen--M\"oller and Yu--Zuo, identify each nonvarying stratum with the locus of smooth deformations of the corresponding singularity, and study when these nonvarying strata can be compactified by weighted projective spaces. Additionally, we classify such singularities with bounded $\alpha$-invariants in the Hassett--Keel log minimal model program for $\overline{\mathcal M}_g$. We also study the slopes of these singularities and utilize them to bound the slopes of effective divisors in $\overline{\mathcal M}_g$. Finally, we show that the loci of subcanonical points with fixed semigroups have trivial tautological rings and provide a criterion to determine whether they are affine.</description>

      <title>Ulrich bundles on double coverings of projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed a polarised variety $X$, we can ask if it admits Ulrich bundles and, in case, what is their minimal possible rank. In this thesis, after recalling general properties of Ulrich sheaves, we show that any finite covering of $\mathbb{P}^n$ that embeds as a divisor in a weighted projective space with weights $(1^{n+1},m)$ admits Ulrich sheaves, by using matrix factorisations. Among these varieties, we focus on double coverings of with $n\ge3$. Through Hartshorne--Serre correspondence, which we review along the way, we prove that the general such $X$ admits a rank $2$ Ulrich sheaf if and only if $n=3$ and $m=2,3,4$, and characterise the zero loci of their sections. Moreover, we construct generically smooth components of the expected dimension of their moduli spaces, analyse the action of the natural involution on them and the restriction of those bundles to low degree hypersurfaces. For $m=2,3$, we verify the existence of slope-stable Ulrich bundles of all the possible ranks.</description>

      <title>Equivariant localizing invariants of simple varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a certain class of simple varieties over a field $k$ by a constructive recipe and show how to control their (equivariant) truncating invariants. Consequently, we prove that on simple varieties: (i) if $k=\overline{k}$ and $\mathrm{char} \ k = p$, the $p$-adic cyclotomic trace is an equivalence; (ii) if $k = \mathbb{Q}$, the Goodwillie-Jones trace is an isomorphism in degree zero; (iii) we can control homotopy invariant $K$-theory $KH$, which is equivariantly formal and determined by its topological counterparts. Simple varieties are quite special, but encompass important singular examples appearing in geometric representation theory. We in particular show that both finite and affine Schubert varieties for $GL_n$ lie in this class, so all the above results hold for them.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of real algebraic maps into curves with prescribed Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. %This can be contribut\ed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>

      <title>Borel subgroups of the automorphism groups of affine toric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [I. Arzhantsev and M. Zaidenberg, Acyclic curves and group actions on affine toric surfaces. Affine Algebraic Geometry, 1--41. World Scientific Publishing Co. 2013] we described the automorphism groups of the cyclic quotients of the affine plane. In this article, we study the Borel subgroups and, more generally, the maximal solvable subgroups of these ind-groups. We show that the cyclic quotients of the affine plane are divided into two species. In one of them, the Borel subgroups form a single conjugacy class, while in the other, there are two conjugacy classes of Borel subgroups. The proofs explore the Bass-Serre-Tits theory of groups acting on trees.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series for Configuration Spaces of Punctured Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,r}$ denote the $r$-punctured closed Riemann surface of genus $g$. For every $g\geq 0$, we determine the four-variable generating function for the mixed Hodge numbers of the unordered configuration spaces of $\Sigma_{g,1}$. The cases where $g\geq 2$ are new. Combining a result of \cite{huang2020cohomology}, this determines the analogous generating function for $\Sigma_{g,r}$ for all $r\geq 1$. As an application of our formula we illustrate how classical homological stability results, as well as so-called secondary stability results of \cite{miller2019higher} can be interpolated to illustrate stable behaviors in the mixed Hodge numbers of these spaces which have been thus-far undiscovered.</description>

      <title>Vector-valued Laurent polynomial equations, toric vector bundles and matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L \subset \mathbb{C}^r \otimes \mathbb{C}[x_1^\pm, \ldots, x_n^\pm]$ be a finite dimensional subspace of vector-valued Laurent polynomials invariant under the action of torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. We study subvarieties in the torus, defined by equations $f = 0$ for generic $f \in L$. We generalize the BKK theorem, that counts the number of solutions of a system of Laurent polynomial equations generic for their Newton polytopes, to this setting. The answer is in terms of mixed volume of certain virtual polytopes encoding discrete invariants of $L$ which involves matroid data. Moreover, we prove an Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequality for these virtual polytopes. Finally, we extend this inequality to non-representable polymatroids. This extends the usual Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for polytopes as well as log-concavity results related to matroids.</description>

      <title>On direct summands of products of Jacobians over arbitrary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a principally polarized abelian variety over a field $k$ is, as an abelian variety, a direct summand of a product of Jacobians of curves which contain a $k$-point if and only if the polarization and the minimal class are both algebraic over $k$. This extends results of Beckmann--de Gaay Fortman and Voisin over the complex numbers to arbitrary fields, and refines an obstruction to the direct summand property over $\mathbb{Q}$ due to Petrov--Skorobogatov. We also give applications to the integral Tate conjecture for divisors and for $1$-cycles on abelian varieties over finitely generated fields; our results also address a $p$-adic version of the integral Tate conjecture in characteristic $p&gt;0$, for the first time beyond the case of divisors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incidence varieties are spaces of $n$-tuples of points in the projective plane that satisfy a given set of collinearity conditions. We classify the components of incidence varieties and realization moduli spaces associated to configurations of up to 10 points, up to birational equivalence. We show that each realization space component is birational to a projective space, a genus 1 curve, or a K3 surface. To do this, we reduce the problem to a study of 163 special arrangements called superfigurations. Then we use computer algebra to describe the realization space of each superfiguration.</description>

      <title>A Deformation Theoretic Reduction of the Hodge Conjecture via Derived Categories and Complete Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric and categorical approach to the Hodge Conjecture for all smooth projective complex varieties. By embedding any such variety into a flat family with general fibers smooth complete intersections, we prove the conjecture unconditionally in the complete intersection case using derived category methods. Through deformation arguments, we reduce the general case to the algebraicity of limits. While this remains an assumption, our framework unifies Hodge theory, deformation, and derived techniques, offering a concrete path toward resolving the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Hodge-theoretic Open/Closed Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the B-model development of the open/closed correspondence proposed by Mayr and Lerche-Mayr, complementing the A-model study in the preceding joint works with Liu and providing a Hodge-theoretic perspective. Given a corresponding pair of open geometry on a toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold $\mathcal{X}$ relative to a framed Aganagic-Vafa brane $\mathcal{L}$ and closed geometry on a toric Calabi-Yau 4-orbifold $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}$, we consider the Hori-Vafa mirrors $\mathcal{X}^\vee$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}^\vee$, where the mirror of $\mathcal{L}$ can be given by a family of hypersurfaces $\mathcal{Y} \subset \mathcal{X}^\vee$. We show that the Picard-Fuchs system associated to $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}$ extends that associated to $\mathcal{X}$ and characterize the full solution space in terms of the open string data. Furthermore, we construct a correspondence between integral 4-cycles in $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}^\vee$ and relative 3-cycles in $(\mathcal{X}^\vee, \mathcal{Y})$ under which the periods of the former match the relative periods of the latter. On the dual side, we identify the variations of mixed Hodge structures on the middle-dimensional cohomology of $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}^\vee$ with that on the middle-dimensional relative cohomology of $(\mathcal{X}^\vee, \mathcal{Y})$ up to a Tate twist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mysterious duality is a relationship, described by Vafa in 2000, between $\frac12$-BPS branes in Type II supergravity in dimension $D=d+2$ and rational curves on del Pezzo surfaces of degree $d$. We show that both sides of this correspondence can be linked to a $\mathbb{Z}_d$ grading of the Lie algebra $E_8$. In addition, we show that the relevant rational curves correspond to `helical' line bundles, that is, line bundles that can appear in a helix on the del Pezzo surface.</description>

      <title>Global pluripotential theory for adelic line bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we relate recent work of Yuan--Zhang and Song on adelic line bundles over quasi-projective arithmetic varieties to recent advances in pluripotential theory on global Berkovich spaces from Pille-Schneider. In particular, we establish an equivalence between subcategories of adelic line bundles on quasi-projective varieties and line bundles on their Berkovich analytifications equipped with a continuous plurisubharmonic metric. We also provide several applications of this equivalence. For example, we generalize a construction of Pille-Schneider concerning families of Monge--Amp\`ere measures on analytifications of projective arithmetic varieties to the quasi-projective setting. With this construction, we offer a new description of non-degenerate subvarieties which involves Monge--Amp\`ere measures over trivially valued fields. Finally, we define a Monge--Amp\`ere measure on the analytification of a quasi-projective arithmetic variety.</description>

      <title>A Lemma on Leech-like Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Leech pair is defined as a pair $(G,S)$, where $S$ is a positive definite even lattice without roots, equipped with a faithful action of a finite group $G$, such that the invariant sublattice of $S$ under the action of $G$ is trivial, and the induced action of $G$ on the discriminant group of $S$ is also trivial. This structure appears naturally when investigating hyperk\"ahler manifolds and the symplectic automorphisms acting on them. An important lemma due to Gaberdiel--Hohenegger--Volpato asserts that a Leech pair $(G,S)$ admits a primitive embedding into the Leech lattice if $rank(S)+\ell(A_S)\le 24$. However, the original proof is incomplete, as demonstrated by a counterexample given by Marquand and Muller. In this paper, we modify the original approach to provide a complete and conceptual proof of the lemma.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates Ulrich bundles on decomposable threefold scrolls X over the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb F_a$, for any integer $a \geq 0$, focusing on the study of their structure and classification. We prove existence of such Ulrich bundles, studying their properties, determining conditions for the Ulrich complexity of their support variety X and analyzing instances of Ulrich wildness for X.
  Our results delve also into the moduli spaces of such Ulrich bundles, characterizing generic smoothness (and sometimes even birational classification) of their modular components and computing their dimensions. Through a detailed analysis of Chern classes, we also provide understanding of the interplay between the geometric properties of the underlying variety X and the algebro-geometric features of Ulrich bundles on it, contributing to their construction as well as to their modular and enumerative theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizability of epimorphisms to curve orbifold groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected dense Zariski open set of a compact K\"ahler manifold $U$, we address the general problem of the existence of surjective holomorphic maps ${F:U\to C}$ to smooth complex quasi-projective curves from properties of $\pi_1(U)$. It is known that, if such $F$ exists, then there exists a finitely generated normal subgroup $K\trianglelefteq\pi_1(U)$ such that $\pi_1(U)/K$ is isomorphic to a curve orbifold group $G$ (i.e. the orbifold fundamental group of a smooth complex quasi-projective curve endowed with an orbifold structure). In this paper, we address the converse of that statement in the case where the orbifold Euler characteristic of $G$ is negative, finding a (unique) surjective holomorphic map $F:U\to C$ which realizes the quotient $\pi_1(U)\twoheadrightarrow \pi_1(U)/K\cong G$ at the level of (orbifold) fundamental groups. We also prove that our theorem is sharp, meaning that the result does not hold for any curve orbifold group with non-negative orbifold Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we apply our main theorem to address Serre's question of which orbifold fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective curves can be realized as fundamental groups of complements of curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of the modularity of an abelian variety defined over the rational number field extending the modularity of an elliptic curve.

      <title>Algebraic Closure of Matrix Sets Recognized by 1-VASS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known how to compute the Zariski closure of a finitely generated monoid of matrices and, more generally, of a set of matrices specified by a regular language. This result was recently used to give a procedure to compute all polynomial invariants of a given affine program. Decidability of the more general problem of computing all polynomial invariants of affine programs with recursive procedure calls remains open. Mathematically speaking, the core challenge is to compute the Zariski closure of a set of matrices defined by a context-free language. In this paper, we approach the problem from two sides: Towards decidability, we give a procedure to compute the Zariski closure of sets of matrices given by one-counter languages (that is, languages accepted by one-dimensional vector addition systems with states and zero tests), a proper subclass of context-free languages. On the other side, we show that the problem becomes undecidable for indexed languages, a natural extension of context-free languages corresponding to nested pushdown automata. One of our main technical tools is a novel adaptation of Simon's factorization forests to infinite monoids of matrices.</description>

Abstract: A family of discrete Schr\"{o}dinger equations with imaginary potentials $V(x)$ is studied. Inside the domain ${\cal D}$ of unitarity-compatible values of $V(x)$, the reality of all of the bound-state energies survives up to the ``exceptional-point'' (EP) maximally non-Hermitian spectral-degeneracy boundaries $\partial {\cal D}$. The computer-assisted localization of the EP limits is performed showing that the complexity of the task grows quickly with the number $N$ of grid points $x$.</description>

      <title>Generalised height pairings and the Albanese kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method in depth two describes the rational points on a curve in terms of a generalisation of Nekov\'a\v{r}'s $p$-adic height pairing which replaces $\mathbb{G}_m$ with a higher Chow group. It is unclear both what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it. This paper explores the relavence of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this problem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the Albanese kernel of $X\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm to compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the Jacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of the nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.</description>

Abstract: I discuss a seemingly unlikely confluence of topics in algebra, numerical computation, and computer vision. The motivating problem is that of solving multiples instances of a parametric family of systems of algebraic (polynomial or rational function) equations. No doubt already of interest to ISSAC attendees, this problem arises in the context of robust model-fitting paradigms currently utilized by the computer vision community (namely "Random Sampling and Consensus", aka "RanSaC".) This talk will give an overview of work in the last 5+ years that aspires to measure the intrinsic difficulty of solving such parametric systems, and makes strides towards practical solutions.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a rational surface obtained by blowing up at a configuration $\mathcal{C}$ of infinitely near points over a Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_\delta$. We prove that there exist two positive integers $a \leq b$ such that the cone of curves of $X$ is finite polyhedral and minimally generated when $\delta \geq a$, and the Cox ring of $X$ is finitely generated whenever $\delta \geq b$. The integers $a$ and $b$ depend only on a combinatorial object (a graph decorated with arrows) representing the strict transforms of the exceptional divisors, their intersections and those with the fibers and special section of $\mathbb{F}_\delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short note revisits the classical result that the complete caustic by refraction of a circle is the evolute of Cartesian ovals. We provide additional details to the statement and geometric proof of this fact, as presented in G. Salmon's 1879 book `Higher Plane Curves'. We observe that as the circle tends to a line, the Cartesian ovals collapse into an ellipse or a branch of a hyperbola. Further, we derive a general formula for caustics by refraction of circles using a computer algebra system, providing a modern computational perspective on this classical problem.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with a relationship regarding the closedness of the singular locus of a Noetherian scheme and existence of classical generators in its category of coherent sheaves, associated bounded derived category, and singularity category. Particularly, we extend an observation initially made by Iyengar and Takahashi in the affine context to the global setting. Furthermore, we furnish an example a Noetherian scheme whose bounded derived category admits a classical generator, yet not every finite scheme over it exhibits the same property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $n$ and a partition $(n_1,\ldots,n_r)$ of $n$, one can consider the associated $n$-dimensional multiprojective space $\mathbb{P}^{n_1}\times \cdots \times \mathbb{P}^{n_r}$. These multiprojective spaces are ubiquitous, not only in the realm of algebraic geometry but also in many other branches of mathematics. It is known that these multiprojective spaces corresponding to distinct partitions are not isomorphic. The available classification techniques of these spaces are mostly algebro-geometric in nature. In this paper, we use a decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of simple Lie algebras to classify these multiprojective spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite subgroup. We introduce a class of projective noncommutative surfaces $\mathbb{P}^2_I$, indexed by a set of irreducible $\Gamma$-representations. Extending the action of $\Gamma$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$, we show that these surfaces generalise both $[\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma]$ and $\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma$. We prove that isomorphism classes of framed torsion-free sheaves on any $\mathbb{P}^2_I$ carry a canonical bijection to the closed points of appropriate Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, we provide geometric interpretations for a class of Nakajima quiver varieties using noncommutative geometry. Our results partially generalise several previous results on such quiver varieties.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new algebraic linearization of the discrete periodic Toda flow by using Mumford's algebraic description of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. In particular, the discrete periodic Toda flow can be expressed in terms of the famous Gau{\ss} composition law for quadratic forms adapted to the framework of hyperelliptic curves by Cantor. One surprising consequence of our approach is a new integrality property for the discrete periodic Toda flow which leads to a $p$-adic description of the closely related periodic box-ball flow, which has very surprising connections to number theory.</description>

Abstract: Two properties of projective hypersurfaces related to the module of Jacobian derivations, namely being tame and being plus-one generated, are discussed in this paper. Tame hypersurfaces are related to Bourbaki ideals, and free hypersurfaces are the simplest examples of tame hypersurfaces. Plus-one generated hypersurfaces are the non free hypersurfaces which are closest to the free ones, and it is an open question whether all of them are tame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</description>

      <title>The real spectrum compactification of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real spectrum compactification of character varieties of finitely generated groups in semisimple Lie groups. This provides a compactification with good topological properties, and we interpret the boundary points in terms of actions on building-like spaces. Among the applications we give a general framework guaranteeing the existence of equivariant harmonic maps in building-like spaces.</description>

      <title>Prym Representations and Twisted Cohomology of the Mapping Class Group with Level Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the twisted cohomology of the mapping class group with level structures, with coefficients in the $r$-tensor powers of the Prym representations for any positive integer $r$. When $r\ge 2$, we show that the cohomology exhibits instability for large genus, whereas it remains stable for $r=0$ or $r=1$. As a corollary, we prove that the symplectic Prym representation associated with any finite abelian regular cover of a non-closed finite-type surface is infinitesimally rigid.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued. As an application of our formula, we recover Sombra's bound on the height of resultants, in the classical case.</description>

      <title>On the Rich Landscape of Complete Intersection Monomial Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to explore complete intersection monomial curves from a contemporary perspective. The main goal is to help readers understand the intricate connections within the field and its potential applications. The properties of any monomial curve singularity will be first reviewed, highlighting the interaction between combinatorial and algebraic properties. Next, we will revisit the two main characterizations of complete intersection monomial curves. One is based on deep algebraic properties given by Herzog and Kunz in 1971, while the other is based on a combinatorial approach given by Delorme in 1976. Our aim is to bridge the gap between these perspectives present in the current literature. Then, we will focus on recent advances that show an intriguing connection between numerical semigroups and Alexander polynomials of knots. Finally, we will revisit the deformation theory of these curves and provide an answer to a question posed by Buchweitz and Greuel regarding curve deformations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Estimation Accuracy of 5 Different Numerical ODE Solvers on 3 Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers are indispensable tools in various engineering domains, enabling the simulation and analysis of dynamic systems. In this work, we utilize 5 different numerical ODE solvers namely: Euler's method, Heun's method, Midpoint Method, Runge-kutta 4th order and ODE45 method in order to discover the answer of three wellknown case studies and compare their results by calculation of relative errors. To check for the validity of the estimations, the experimental data of previous literature have been compared with the data in this paper which shows a good accordance. We observe that for each of the case studies based on the behavior of the model, the estimation accuracy of the solvers is different. For the logistic population change as the first case study, the results of all solvers are so close to each other that only their solution cost can be considered for their superiority. For temperature change of a building as the second case study we see that in some especial areas the accuracy of the solvers is different and in general Midpoint ODE solver shows better results. As the last case study, market equilibrium price shows that none of the numerical ODE solvers can estimate its behavior which is due to its sudden changing nature.</description>

      <title>Linear operators preserving volume polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear operators preserving the property of being a volume polynomial. More, precisely we show that a linear operator preserves this property if the associated symbol is itself a volume polynomial. This can be seen as an analogue to theorems by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Br\"and\'en-Huh for stable polynomials and Lorentzian polynomials, respectively.</description>
