      <title>Single Block On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital age, individuals increasingly maintain active presences across multiple platforms ranging from social media and messaging applications to professional and communication tools. However, the current model for managing user level privacy and abuse is siloed, requiring users to block undesirable contacts independently on each platform. This paper introduces Single Block On (SBO) a unified and interoperable system enabling users to block an individual once and have that block propagated across all integrated applications. SBO operates via identity based matching rules, utilizing configurable levels of identifier similarity, and interfaces with systems through standardized protocols such as SSO, LDAP, or direct REST integration. A novel Contact Rule Markup Language (CRML) facilitates consistent policy sharing across systems. The proposed solution increases user safety, enhances digital well-being, and sets a precedent for interoperable privacy enforcement.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study and Implementation of Key Derivation Functions Standardized by NIST and IEEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since many applications and services require pseudorandom numbers (PRNs), it is feasible to generate specific PRNs under given key values and input messages using Key Derivation Functions (KDFs). These KDFs are primarily constructed based on Message Authentication Codes (MACs), where the MAC serves as a core component in the generation of pseudorandom numbers. In light of this, the study first examines three MAC algorithms defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): the Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), and the Keccak-based Message Authentication Code (KMAC). Subsequently, the study explores KDFs based on these MACs, including the Counter Mode KDF, the KMAC-based KDF, and the KDF defined in IEEE 1609.2.1. In experiments, the computation times for generating MACs and the corresponding pseudorandom numbers using each KDF are evaluated. The study further analyzes the advantages, disadvantages, and applicable scenarios for each method. Experimental results indicate that the CMAC and the CMAC-based KDF exhibit the shortest computation times, averaging approximately 0.007 milliseconds and 0.014 milliseconds, respectively.</description>

      <title>We Urgently Need Privilege Management in MCP: A Measurement of API Usage in MCP Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a widely adopted mechanism for connecting large language models to external tools and resources. While MCP promises seamless extensibility and rich integrations, it also introduces a substantially expanded attack surface: any plugin can inherit broad system privileges with minimal isolation or oversight. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of MCP security risks. We develop an automated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world MCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal that network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438 and 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less frequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API Development plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins often contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case studies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege escalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these findings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify security-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer MCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust assessment.</description>

      <title>False Alarms, Real Damage: Adversarial Attacks Using LLM-based Models on Text-based Cyber Threat Intelligence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has emerged as a vital complementary approach that operates in the early phases of the cyber threat lifecycle. CTI involves collecting, processing, and analyzing threat data to provide a more accurate and rapid understanding of cyber threats. Due to the large volume of data, automation through Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models is essential for effective CTI extraction. These automated systems leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from sources like social networks, forums, and blogs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Although prior research has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study expands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of the entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities arise because they ingest textual inputs from various open sources, including real and potentially fake content. We analyse three types of attacks against CTI pipelines, including evasion, flooding, and poisoning, and assess their impact on the system's information selection capabilities. Specifically, on fake text generation, the work demonstrates how adversarial text generation techniques can create fake cybersecurity and cybersecurity-like text that misleads classifiers, degrades performance, and disrupts system functionality. The focus is primarily on the evasion attack, as it precedes and enables flooding and poisoning attacks within the CTI pipeline.</description>

      <title>Emergent misalignment as prompt sensitivity: A research note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to prompt nudges.
  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models' probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models perceive harmful intent in these questions.
  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and so release these early results as a research note.</description>

      <title>Wallets as Universal Access Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wallets are access points for the digital economys value creation. Wallets for blockchains store the end-users cryptographic keys for administrating their digital assets and enable access to blockchain Web3 systems. Web3 delivers new service opportunities. This chapter focuses on the Web3 enabled release of value through the lens of wallets. Wallets may be implemented as software apps on smartphones, web apps on desktops, or hardware devices. Wallet users request high security, ease of use, and access of relevance from their wallets. Increasing connectivity, functionality, autonomy, personal support, and offline capability make the wallet into the user's Universal Access Device for any digital asset. Through wallet based services, the owner obtains enhanced digital empowerment. The new Web3 solutionareas, Identity and Decentralisation, enable considerable societal effects, and wallets are an integral part of these. One example is self sovereign identity solutions combined with wallet borne AI for personalised support, empowering the enduser beyond anything previously known. Improved welfare is foreseen globally through enlarged markets with collaborative services with drastically lowered transaction costs compared to today, the expected vastly increased levels of automation in society necessitate enhanced enduser protection. As wallets are considered a weak spot for security, improving overall security through blockchains is essential.</description>

      <title>Attacker's Noise Can Manipulate Your Audio-based LLM in the Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the real-world vulnerabilities of audio-based large language models (ALLMs), such as Qwen2-Audio. We first demonstrate that an adversary can craft stealthy audio perturbations to manipulate ALLMs into exhibiting specific targeted behaviors, such as eliciting responses to wake-keywords (e.g., "Hey Qwen"), or triggering harmful behaviors (e.g. "Change my calendar event"). Subsequently, we show that playing adversarial background noise during user interaction with the ALLMs can significantly degrade the response quality. Crucially, our research illustrates the scalability of these attacks to real-world scenarios, impacting other innocent users when these adversarial noises are played through the air. Further, we discuss the transferrability of the attack, and potential defensive measures.</description>

      <title>Phantom Subgroup Poisoning: Stealth Attacks on Federated Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising solution for delivering personalized recommendations while safeguarding user privacy. However, recent studies have demonstrated their vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which compromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast, real-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user subgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the federated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage approximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of target/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target subgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group embeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's relevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we further propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and non-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to align the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing Spattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven representative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that Spattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific user subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when only 0.1\% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive overall recommendation performance and exhibits strong resilience against existing mainstream defenses.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Critical Risks of Amazon's Nova Premier under the Frontier Model Safety Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nova Premier is Amazon's most capable multimodal foundation model and teacher for model distillation. It processes text, images, and video with a one-million-token context window, enabling analysis of large codebases, 400-page documents, and 90-minute videos in a single prompt. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of Nova Premier's critical risk profile under the Frontier Model Safety Framework. Evaluations target three high-risk domains -- Chemical, Biological, Radiological &amp; Nuclear (CBRN), Offensive Cyber Operations, and Automated AI R&amp;D -- and combine automated benchmarks, expert red-teaming, and uplift studies to determine whether the model exceeds release thresholds. We summarize our methodology and report core findings. Based on this evaluation, we find that Nova Premier is safe for public release as per our commitments made at the 2025 Paris AI Safety Summit. We will continue to enhance our safety evaluation and mitigation pipelines as new risks and capabilities associated with frontier models are identified.</description>

      <title>Q-Detection: A Quantum-Classical Hybrid Poisoning Attack Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by introducing malicious data into the training process, thereby degrading model performance or manipulating predictions. Detecting and sifting out poisoned data is an important method to prevent data poisoning attacks. Limited by classical computation frameworks, upcoming larger-scale and more complex datasets may pose difficulties for detection. We introduce the unique speedup of quantum computing for the first time in the task of detecting data poisoning. We present Q-Detection, a quantum-classical hybrid defense method for detecting poisoning attacks. Q-Detection also introduces the Q-WAN, which is optimized using quantum computing devices. Experimental results using multiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends against label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that Q-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to the state-of-the-art. Theoretical analysis shows that Q-Detection is expected to achieve more than a 20% speedup using quantum computing power.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Watermark Resilience Against Both Scrubbing and Spoofing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking is a promising defense against the misuse of large language models (LLMs), yet it remains vulnerable to scrubbing and spoofing attacks. This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0% and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset settings.</description>

      <title>The bitter lesson of misuse detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work on jailbreak detection has established the importance of adversarial robustness for LLMs but has largely focused on the model ability to resist adversarial inputs and to output safe content, rather than the effectiveness of external supervision systems. The only public and independent benchmark of these guardrails to date evaluates a narrow set of supervisors on limited scenarios. Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies how well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse attacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of LLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity (benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs. jailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11 harm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized supervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their semantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited, sometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question directly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply asking generalist LLMs if the user question is "harmful or not" largely outperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But frontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to queries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and greater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple scaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more research is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results support the "bitter lesson" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs are necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.</description>

      <title>Bridging AI and Software Security: A Comparative Vulnerability Assessment of LLM Agent Deployment Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250 attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection. Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure deployment.

      <title>An Architecture for Privacy-Preserving Telemetry Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a privacy-preserving telemetry aggregation scheme. Our underlying frequency estimation routine works within the framework of differential privacy. The design philosophy follows a client-server architecture. Furthermore, the system uses a local differential privacy scheme where data gets randomized on the client before submitting the request to the resource server. This scheme allows for data analysis on de-identified data by carefully adding noise to prevent re-identification attacks, thereby facilitating public data release without compromising the identifiability of the individual record. This work further enhances privacy guarantees by leveraging Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) to achieve increased privacy protection for data in transit that addresses pre-existing privacy vulnerabilities in raw HTTP. We provide an implementation that focuses on frequency estimation with a histogram of a known dictionary. Our resulting formulation based on OHTTP has provided stricter privacy safeguards when compared to trusting an organization to manually delete identifying information from the client's request in the ingestor as deployed in reference work~\cite{apple2017}.

      <title>Never Trust the Manufacturer, Never Trust the Client: A Novel Method for Streaming STL Files for Secure Additive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While additive manufacturing has opened interesting avenues to reimagine manufacturing as a service (MaaS) platform, transmission of design files from client to manufacturer over networks opens up many cybersecurity challenges. Securing client's intellectual property (IP) especially from cyber-attacks emerges as a major challenge. Earlier works introduced streaming, instead of sharing process plan (G-code) files, as a possible solution. However, executing client's G-codes on manufacturer's machines exposes them to potential malicious G-codes. This paper proposes a viable approach when the client and manufacturer do not trust each other and both the client and manufacturer want to preserve their IP of designs and manufacturing process respectively. The proposed approach is based on segmenting and streaming design (STL) files and employing a novel machine-specific STL to G-code translator at the manufacturer's site in real-time for printing. This approach secures design and manufacturing process IPs as demonstrated in a real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>Rugsafe: A multichain protocol for recovering from and defending against Rug Pulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rugsafe introduces a comprehensive protocol aimed at mitigating the risks of rug pulls in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By utilizing cryptographic security measures and economic incentives, the protocol provides a secure multichain system for recovering assets and transforming rugged tokens into opportunities and rewards. Foundational to Rugsafe are specialized vaults where rugged tokens can be securely deposited, and anticoin tokens are issued as receipts. These anticoins are designed to be inversely pegged to the price movement of the underlying rugged token. Users can utilize these anticoins within the ecosystem or choose to burn them, further securing the protocol and earning additional rewards. The supply of the native Rugsafe token is dynamically adjusted based on the volume, value, and activity of rugged tokens, ensuring stability and resilience. By depositing rugged tokens into a vault on several chains, and by burning anticoins, users receive incentives on the RugSafe chain. This protocol's vaults are designed to work in heterogenous blockchain ecosystems, offering a practical and effective solution to one of the most significant challenges in the cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>HEMA: A Hands-on Exploration Platform for MEMS Sensor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive safety and security are paramount in the rapidly advancing landscape of vehicular technology. Building safe and secure vehicles demands a profound understanding of automotive systems, particularly in safety and security. Traditional learning approaches, such as reading materials or observing demonstrations, often fail to provide the practical, hands-on experience essential for developing this expertise. For novice users, gaining access to automotive-grade systems and mastering their associated hardware and software can be challenging and overwhelming. In this paper, we present a novel, affordable, and flexible exploration platform, \hema, that enables users to gain practical, hands-on insights into the security compromises of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, a critical component in modern ADAS systems. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges and design considerations involved in creating such a platform, emphasizing its role in enhancing the understanding of automotive safety and security. This framework serves as an invaluable resource for educators, researchers, and practitioners striving to build expertise in the field.</description>

      <title>Vectorised Hashing Based on Bernstein-Rabin-Winograd Polynomials over Prime Order Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the new AXU hash function decBRWHash, which is parameterised by the positive integer $c$ and is based on Bernstein-Rabin-Winograd (BRW) polynomials. Choosing $c&gt;1$ gives a hash function which can be implemented using $c$-way single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions. We report a set of very comprehensive hand optimised assembly implementations of 4-decBRWHash using avx2 SIMD instructions available on modern Intel processors. For comparison, we also report similar carefully optimised avx2 assembly implementations of polyHash, an AXU hash function based on usual polynomials. Our implementations are over prime order fields, specifically the primes $2^{127}-1$ and $2^{130}-5$. For the prime $2^{130}-5$, for avx2 implementations, compared to the famous Poly1305 hash function, 4-decBRWHash is faster for messages which are a few hundred bytes long and achieves a speed-up of about 16% for message lengths in a few kilobytes range and improves to a speed-up of about 23% for message lengths in a few megabytes range.</description>

      <title>TELSAFE: Security Gap Quantitative Risk Assessment Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaps between established security standards and their practical implementation have the potential to introduce vulnerabilities, possibly exposing them to security risks. To effectively address and mitigate these security and compliance challenges, security risk management strategies are essential. However, it must adhere to well-established strategies and industry standards to ensure consistency, reliability, and compatibility both within and across organizations. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid risk assessment framework called TELSAFE, which employs probabilistic modeling for quantitative risk assessment and eliminates the influence of expert opinion bias. The framework encompasses both qualitative and quantitative assessment phases, facilitating effective risk management strategies tailored to the unique requirements of organizations. A specific use case utilizing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)-related data demonstrates the framework's applicability and implementation in real-world scenarios, such as in the telecommunications industry.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Artificial Noise for Physical Layer Security: Opportunities, Technologies, Guidelines, Advances, and Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications, physical-layer security has attracted increasing concerns from both academia and industry. Artificial noise (AN), as one of the promising physical-layer security techniques, is capable of utilizing the spatial degree-of-freedom of channels to effectively enhance the security of wireless communications. In contrast to other physicallayer security techniques, the key distinguishing feature of AN is to generate specific interfering signals according to channel characteristics, increasing the secrecy capacity by reducing the wiretap channel capacity without affecting the legitimate channel capacity. Hence, this paper provides the latest survey of AN, including its evolution, modeling, backgrounds, applications, and future trends. Initially, we introduce the development, fundamentals, and backgrounds of AN. Subsequently, we highlight a comprehensive survey of the current state of research on various AN-empowered scenarios and AN-combined technologies. Finally, we discuss some technical challenges to tackle for AN-aided wireless security in the future.</description>

      <title>Subgraph Counting under Edge Local Differential Privacy Based on Noisy Adjacency Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When analyzing connection patterns within graphs, subgraph counting serves as an effective and fundamental approach. Edge-local differential privacy (edge-LDP) and shuffle model have been employed to achieve subgraph counting under a privacy-preserving situation. Existing algorithms are plagued by high time complexity, excessive download costs, low accuracy, or dependence on trusted third parties. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the Noisy Adjacency Matrix (NAM), which combines differential privacy with the adjacency matrix of the graph. NAM offers strong versatility and scalability, making it applicable to a wider range of DP variants, DP mechanisms, and graph types. Based on NAM, we designed five algorithms (TriOR, TriTR, TriMTR, QuaTR, and 2STAR) to count three types of subgraphs: triangles, quadrangles, and 2-stars. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that in triangle counting, TriOR maximizes accuracy with reduced time complexity among one-round algorithms, TriTR achieves optimal accuracy, TriMTR achieves the highest accuracy under low download costs, and QuaTR stands as the first quadrangle counting algorithm under pure edge-LDP. We implement edge-LDP for noisy data via a confidence interval-inspired method, providing DP guarantees on randomized data. Our 2STAR algorithm achieves the highest accuracy in 2-star counting and can be derived as a byproduct of two-round triangle or quadrangle counting algorithms, enabling efficient joint estimation of triangle, quadrangle, and 2-star counts within two query rounds.</description>

      <title>Approximating Euler Totient Function using Linear Regression on RSA moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of the RSA cryptosystem is based on the intractability of computing Euler's totient function phi(n) for large integers n. Although deriving phi(n) deterministically remains computationally infeasible for cryptographically relevant bit lengths, and machine learning presents a promising alternative for constructing efficient approximations. In this work, we explore a machine learning approach to approximate Euler's totient function phi using linear regression models. We consider a dataset of RSA moduli of 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 bits along with their corresponding totient values. The regression model is trained to capture the relationship between the modulus and its totient, and tested on unseen samples to evaluate its prediction accuracy. Preliminary results suggest that phi can be approximated within a small relative error margin, which may be sufficient to aid in certain classes of RSA attacks. This research opens a direction for integrating statistical learning techniques into cryptanalysis, providing insights into the feasibility of attacking cryptosystems using approximation based strategies.</description>

      <title>PotentRegion4MalDetect: Advanced Features from Potential Malicious Regions for Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware developers exploit the fact that most detection models focus on the entire binary to extract the feature rather than on the regions of potential maliciousness. Therefore, they reverse engineer a benign binary and inject malicious code into it. This obfuscation technique circumvents the malware detection models and deceives the ML classifiers due to the prevalence of benign features compared to malicious features. However, extracting the features from the potential malicious regions enhances the accuracy and decreases false positives. Hence, we propose a novel model named PotentRegion4MalDetect that extracts features from the potential malicious regions. PotentRegion4MalDetect determines the nodes with potential maliciousness in the partially preprocessed Control Flow Graph (CFG) using the malicious strings given by StringSifter. Then, it extracts advanced features of the identified potential malicious regions alongside the features from the completely preprocessed CFG. The features extracted from the completely preprocessed CFG mitigate obfuscation techniques that attempt to disguise malicious content, such as suspicious strings. The experiments reveal that the PotentRegion4MalDetect requires fewer entries to save the features for all binaries than the model focusing on the entire binary, reducing memory overhead, faster computation, and lower storage requirements. These advanced features give an 8.13% increase in SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Absolute Mean and a 1.44% increase in SHAP Beeswarm value compared to those extracted from the entire binary. The advanced features outperform the features extracted from the entire binary by producing more than 99% accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, F1-score, and 0.064% FPR.</description>

      <title>PenTest2.0: Towards Autonomous Privilege Escalation Using GenAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethical hacking today relies on highly skilled practitioners executing complex sequences of commands, which is inherently time-consuming, difficult to scale, and prone to human error. To help mitigate these limitations, we previously introduced 'PenTest++', an AI-augmented system combining automation with generative AI supporting ethical hacking workflows. However, a key limitation of PenTest++ was its lack of support for privilege escalation, a crucial element of ethical hacking. In this paper we present 'PenTest2.0', a substantial evolution of PenTest++ supporting automated privilege escalation driven entirely by Large Language Model reasoning. It also incorporates several significant enhancements: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation', including both one-line and offline modes; 'Chain-of-Thought' prompting for intermediate reasoning; persistent 'PenTest Task Trees' to track goal progression across turns; and the optional integration of human-authored hints. We describe how it operates, present a proof-of-concept prototype, and discuss its benefits and limitations. We also describe application of the system to a controlled Linux target, showing it can carry out multi-turn, adaptive privilege escalation. We explain the rationale behind its core design choices, and provide comprehensive testing results and cost analysis. Our findings indicate that 'PenTest2.0' represents a meaningful step toward practical, scalable, AI-automated penetration testing, whilst highlighting the shortcomings of generative AI systems, particularly their sensitivity to prompt structure, execution context, and semantic drift, reinforcing the need for further research and refinement in this emerging space.

      <title>The Dark Side of LLMs Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) offer a promising mechanism to protect Australian and Indigenous artists' copyright. They represent and transfer the value of artwork in digital form. Before adopting NFTs to protect Australian artwork, we in this paper investigate them empericially. We focus on examining the details of NFT structure. We start from the underlying structure of NFTs to show how they represent copyright for both artists and production owners, as well as how they aim to safeguard or secure the value of digital artworks. We then involve data collection from various types of sources with different storage methods, including on-chain, centralized, and decentralized systems. Based on both metadata and artwork content, we present our analysis and discussion on the following key issues: copyright, security and artist identification. The final results of the evaluation, unfortnately, show that the NFT is NOT ready to protect Australian and Indigenous artists' copyright.</description>

      <title>BarkBeetle: Stealing Decision Tree Models with Fault Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models, particularly decision trees (DTs), are widely adopted across various domains due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, as ML models become increasingly integrated into privacy-sensitive applications, concerns about their confidentiality have grown, particularly in light of emerging threats such as model extraction and fault injection attacks. Assessing the vulnerability of DTs under such attacks is therefore important. In this work, we present BarkBeetle, a novel attack that leverages fault injection to extract internal structural information of DT models. BarkBeetle employs a bottom-up recovery strategy that uses targeted fault injection at specific nodes to efficiently infer feature splits and threshold values. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that BarkBeetle requires significantly fewer queries and recovers more structural information compared to prior approaches, when evaluated on DTs trained with public UCI datasets. To validate its practical feasibility, we implement BarkBeetle on a Raspberry Pi RP2350 board and perform fault injections using the Faultier voltage glitching tool. As BarkBeetle targets general DT models, we also provide an in-depth discussion on its applicability to a broader range of tree-based applications, including data stream classification, DT variants, and cryptography schemes.</description>

      <title>ZKTorch: Compiling ML Inference to Zero-Knowledge Proofs via Parallel Proof Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI models become ubiquitous in our daily lives, there has been an increasing demand for transparency in ML services. However, the model owner does not want to reveal the weights, as they are considered trade secrets. To solve this problem, researchers have turned to zero-knowledge proofs of ML model inference. These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is correct, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on these provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the ML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The second method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific class of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making it impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not generalize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of machine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end proving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations called basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built on top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling succinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow ZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to specialized protocols and up to a $6\times$ speedup in proving time over a general-purpose ZKML framework.</description>

      <title>LoRAShield: Data-Free Editing Alignment for Secure Personalized LoRA Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models has democratized personalized text-to-image generation, enabling users to share lightweight models (e.g., personal portraits) on platforms like Civitai and Liblib. However, this "share-and-play" ecosystem introduces critical risks: benign LoRAs can be weaponized by adversaries to generate harmful content (e.g., political, defamatory imagery), undermining creator rights and platform safety. Existing defenses like concept-erasure methods focus on full diffusion models (DMs), neglecting LoRA's unique role as a modular adapter and its vulnerability to adversarial prompt engineering. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRAShield, the first data-free editing framework for securing LoRA models against misuse. Our platform-driven approach dynamically edits and realigns LoRA's weight subspace via adversarial optimization and semantic augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that LoRAShield achieves remarkable effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness in blocking malicious generations without sacrificing the functionality of the benign task. By shifting the defense to platforms, LoRAShield enables secure, scalable sharing of personalized models, a critical step toward trustworthy generative ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Generalized and Unified Equivalences between Hardness and Pseudoentropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability (known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009) and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.</description>

      <title>Detection of Intelligent Tampering in Wireless Electrocardiogram Signals Using Hybrid Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN, ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks. The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54 subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN, FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding 99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Walsh Spectrum of Power Residue S-Boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a prime field with $q \geq 3$, and let $d, m \geq 1$ be integers such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$ and $m \mid (q - 1)$. In this paper we bound the absolute values of the Walsh spectrum of S-Boxes $S (x) = x^d \cdot T \left( x^\frac{q - 1}{m} \right)$, where $T$ is a function with $T (x) \neq 0$ if $x \neq 0$. Such S-Boxes have been proposed for the Zero-Knowledge-friendly hash functions Grendel and Polocolo. In particular, we prove the conjectured correlation of the Polocolo S-Box.</description>

      <title>Unifying Re-Identification, Attribute Inference, and Data Reconstruction Risks in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary (including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.</description>

      <title>Integer Factorization: Another perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integer factorization is a fundamental problem in algorithmic number theory and computer science. It is considered as a one way or trapdoor function in the (RSA) cryptosystem. To date, from elementary trial division to sophisticated methods like the General Number Field Sieve, no known algorithm can break the problem in polynomial time, while its proved that Shor's algorithm could on a quantum computer. In this paper, we recall some factorization algorithms and then approach the problem under different angles. Firstly, we take the problem from the ring $\displaystyle\left(\mathbb{Z}, \text{+}, \cdot\right)$ to the Lebesgue space $\mathcal{L}^{1}\left(X\right)$ where $X$ can be $\mathbb{Q}$ or any given interval setting. From this first perspective, integer factorization becomes equivalent to finding the perimeter of a rectangle whose area is known. In this case, it is equivalent to either finding bounds of integrals or finding primitives for some given bounds. Secondly, we take the problem from the ring $\displaystyle\left(\mathbb{Z}, \text{+}, \cdot\right) $ to the ring of matrices $\left( M_{2}\text{(}\mathbb{Z}\text{)}, \ \text{+} \ \cdot\right)$ and show that this problem is equivalent to matrix decomposition, and therefore present some possible computing algorithms, particularly using Gr\"obner basis and through matrix diagonalization. Finally, we address the problem depending on algebraic forms of factors and show that this problem is equivalent to finding small roots of a bivariate polynomial through coppersmith's method.
  The aim of this study is to propose innovative methodological approaches to reformulate this problem, thereby offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>Breaking PEFT Limitations: Leveraging Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Transfer for Backdoor Attacks in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning (FPFT). However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from the weak-to-strong based on Feature Alignment-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (FAKD). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through FPFT to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through FAKD, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that FAKD has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of FAKD on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.</description>

      <title>Real AI Agents with Fake Memories: Fatal Context Manipulation Attacks on Web3 Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents integrated with Web3 offer autonomy and openness but raise security concerns as they interact with financial protocols and immutable smart contracts. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of AI agents within blockchain-based financial ecosystems when exposed to adversarial threats in real-world scenarios. We introduce the concept of context manipulation -- a comprehensive attack vector that exploits unprotected context surfaces, including input channels, memory modules, and external data feeds. It expands on traditional prompt injection and reveals a more stealthy and persistent threat: memory injection. Using ElizaOS, a representative decentralized AI agent framework for automated Web3 operations, we showcase that malicious injections into prompts or historical records can trigger unauthorized asset transfers and protocol violations which could be financially devastating in reality. To quantify these risks, we introduce CrAIBench, a Web3-focused benchmark covering 150+ realistic blockchain tasks. such as token transfers, trading, bridges, and cross-chain interactions, and 500+ attack test cases using context manipulation. Our evaluation results confirm that AI models are significantly more vulnerable to memory injection compared to prompt injection. Finally, we evaluate a comprehensive defense roadmap, finding that prompt-injection defenses and detectors only provide limited protection when stored context is corrupted, whereas fine-tuning-based defenses substantially reduce attack success rates while preserving performance on single-step tasks. These results underscore the urgent need for AI agents that are both secure and fiduciarily responsible in blockchain environments.</description>

      <title>On Jailbreaking Quantized Language Models Through Fault Injection Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks, such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high success (&gt;80% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20% and 50%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8 models maintained ASR below 65%, demonstrating some resilience compared to INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes, with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides, jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent FP8/INT8 quantization (&lt;5% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced transferred ASR (avg. 35% drop). These findings highlight that while common quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist, especially through post-attack quantization.</description>

      <title>AI Agent Smart Contract Exploit Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59 million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations 2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8% without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100% vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require &gt;=1.000% rates to break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a \$6000 exploit value, while defenders require \$60000, raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Wrapless -- a lending protocol that enables the collateralization of bitcoins without requiring a trusted wrapping mechanism. The protocol facilitates a "loan channel" on the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing bitcoins to be locked as collateral for loans issued on any blockchain that supports Turing-complete smart contracts. The protocol is designed in a way that makes it economically irrational for each involved party to manipulate the loan rules. There is still a significant research area to bring the protocol closer to traditional AMM financial instruments.</description>

      <title>Protecting Classifiers From Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.08705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multiple domains such as malware detection, automated driving systems, or fraud detection, classification algorithms are susceptible to being attacked by malicious agents willing to perturb the value of instance covariates to pursue certain goals. Such problems pertain to the field of adversarial machine learning and have been mainly dealt with, perhaps implicitly, through game-theoretic ideas with strong underlying common knowledge assumptions. These are not realistic in numerous application domains in relation to security and business competition. We present an alternative Bayesian decision theoretic framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the attacker's behavior using adversarial risk analysis concepts. In doing so, we also present core ideas in adversarial machine learning to a statistical audience. A key ingredient in our framework is the ability to sample from the distribution of originating instances given the, possibly attacked, observed ones. We propose an initial procedure based on approximate Bayesian computation usable during operations; within it, we simulate the attacker's problem taking into account our uncertainty about his elements. Large-scale problems require an alternative scalable approach implementable during the training stage. Globally, we are able to robustify statistical classification algorithms against malicious attacks.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications has led to an increased demand for advanced analytics and machine learning techniques capable of handling the challenges associated with data privacy, security, and scalability. Federated learning (FL) and blockchain technologies have emerged as promising approaches to address these challenges by enabling decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving model training on distributed data sources. In this paper, we present a novel IoT solution that combines the incremental learning vector quantization algorithm (XuILVQ) with Ethereum blockchain technology to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing, model training, and prototype storage in a distributed environment. Our proposed architecture addresses the shortcomings of existing blockchain-based FL solutions by reducing computational and communication overheads while maintaining data privacy and security. We assess the performance of our system through a series of experiments, showcasing its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning tasks in IoT settings.</description>

Abstract: Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \;\mathrm{mod}\; m$. We find that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). By analyzing the embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we investigate how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus; and demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. We find that models learn to factorize $m$ and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $d= 3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.</description>

      <title>GuidedBench: Measuring and Mitigating the Evaluation Discrepancies of In-the-wild LLM Jailbreak Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in jailbreak methods as an effective red-teaming tool for building safe and responsible large language models (LLMs), flawed evaluation system designs have led to significant discrepancies in their effectiveness assessments. We conduct a systematic measurement study based on 37 jailbreak studies since 2022, focusing on both the methods and the evaluation systems they employ. We find that existing evaluation systems lack case-specific criteria, resulting in misleading conclusions about their effectiveness and safety implications. This paper advocates a shift to a more nuanced, case-by-case evaluation paradigm. We introduce GuidedBench, a novel benchmark comprising a curated harmful question dataset, detailed case-by-case evaluation guidelines and an evaluation system integrated with these guidelines -- GuidedEval. Experiments demonstrate that GuidedBench offers more accurate measurements of jailbreak performance, enabling meaningful comparisons across methods and uncovering new insights overlooked in previous evaluations. GuidedEval reduces inter-evaluator variance by at least 76.03\%. Furthermore, we observe that incorporating guidelines can enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak methods themselves, offering new insights into both attack strategies and evaluation paradigms.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoder as a Zero-Shot Classifier for Concept Erasing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at: https://github.com/NANSirun/Interpret-then-deactivate.</description>

      <title>Saffron-1: Safety Inference Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .</description>

      <title>SHADE-Arena: Evaluating Sabotage and Monitoring in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection &amp; Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>PBa-LLM: Privacy- and Bias-aware NLP using Named-Entity Recognition (NER)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in highstakes AI-based applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns, this work explores the use of Named- Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data, such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT) applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining our proposed Privacyand Bias-aware LLMs (PBa-LLMs). Note that the proposed PBa-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.</description>
