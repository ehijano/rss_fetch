      <title>Interactions of fractional solitons with local defects: Stabilization and scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability is an essential problem in theoretical and experimental studies of solitons in nonlinear media with fractional diffraction, which is represented by the Riesz derivative with Levy index (LI) taking values LI &lt; 2. Fractional solitons are unstable at LI smaller or equal to 1, or LI smaller or equal to 2 in uniform one-dimensional media with the cubic or quintic self-focusing, respectively. We demonstrate that, in these cases, the solitons may be effectively stabilized by pinning to a delta-functional trapping potential (attractive defect), which is a relevant setting in optical waveguides with the effective fractional diffraction. Using the respective fractional nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the delta-functional potential term, we find that, in the case of the cubic self-focusing, the fractional solitons are fully stabilized by the pinning to the defect for LI = 1, and partly stabilized for LI &lt; 1. In the case of the quintic self-focusing, the full and partial stabilization are found for LI = 2 and LI &lt; 2, respectively. In both cases, the instability boundary is exactly predicted by the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. Unstable solitons spontaneously transform into oscillating breathers. A variational approximation (VA) is elaborated parallel to the numerical analysis, with a conclusion that the VA produces accurate results for lower LI values, i.e., stronger fractionality. In the cubic medium, collisions of traveling stable solitons with repulsive and attractive defects are addressed too, demonstrating outcomes in the form of rebound, splitting, and passage.</description>

      <title>Quadratic solitons in higher-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) created in chi(2) nonlinear medium and based on two-dimensional generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide array, where transition between trivial and topological phases is achieved by shift of the four waveguides in the unit cell towards its center or towards its periphery. Such HOTI can support linear topological corner states that give rise to rich families of quadratic topological solitons bifurcating from linear corner states. The presence of phase mismatch between parametrically interacting fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves drastically affects the bifurcation scenarios and domains of soliton existence, making the families of corner solitons much richer in comparison with those in HOTIs with cubic nonlinearity. For instance, the internal soliton structure strongly depends on the location of propagation constant in forbidden gaps in spectra of both FF and SH waves. Two different types of corner solitons are obtained, where either FF or SH wave dominates in the bifurcation point from linear corner state. Because the waveguides are two-mode for SH wave, its spectrum features two groups of forbidden gaps with corner states of different symmetry appearing in each of them. Such corner states give rise to different families of corner solitons. Stability analysis shows that corner solitons in quadratic HOTI may feature wide stability domains and therefore are observable experimentally. These results illustrate how parametric nonlinear interactions enrich the behavior of topological excitations and allow to control their shapes.</description>
