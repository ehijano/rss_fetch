      <title>Nonlinear transmission line: shock waves and the simple wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper we obtain the analytic solution for the profile of a shock wave in a nonlinear lossy transmission line, constructed from the inductors, the capacitors and the resistors. both the charge of a capacitor and a current through the inductor are obtained as the functions of the time and space coordinate. In the second part of the paper we formulate the simple wave approximation for the nonlinear lossless transmission line.</description>

      <title>Configurational Entropy and Its Scaling Behavior in Lattice Systems with Number of States Defined by Coordination Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an exactly solvable lattice model that reveals a universal finite-size scaling law for configurational entropy driven purely by geometry. Using exact enumeration via Burnside's lemma, we compute the entropy for diverse 1D, 2D, and 3D lattices, finding that the deviation from the thermodynamic limit $s_{\infty} = \ln (z)$ scales as $\Delta s_{N} \sim N^{-1/d}$, with lattice-dependent higher-order corrections. This scaling, observed across structures from chains to FCC and diamond lattices, offers a minimal framework to quantify geometric influences on entropy. The model captures the order of magnitude of experimental residual entropies (e.g., $S_{\mathrm{molar}} = R \ln 12 \approx 20.7 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}$) and provides a reference for understanding entropy-driven order in colloids, clusters, and solids.</description>

      <title>On the motion of a point charge in a plate capacitor considering influence effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A point charge between the plates of a capacitor generates an influence charge distribution on the plates that modify the electric field acting upon the point charge. This effect is described by the well-known Dirichlet Green's function for the two parallel conducting plate problem for which we derive an infinite mirror charge series representation. At the line perpendicular to the plates and passing through the point charge this Green's function and hence the total force can be explicitly evaluated in terms of the psi function. For the motion of the point charge we develop an analytical approximation and compare it with the numerical integration of the exact equations of motion. The correction due to influence effects is shown to be of order $O(-\lambda \log \lambda)$ where $\lambda$ denotes the relative strength of the Green's function compared with the pure capacitor potential.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>
