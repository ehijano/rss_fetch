      <title>QUBO Formulations for Variation of Domination Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of quantum computing, the use of quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers has become a major research focus. The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model serves as a bridge between combinatorial optimization problems and quantum computers, and is a prerequisite for these studies. In combinatorial optimization problems, the Domination Problem (DP) is related to many practical issues in the real world, such as the fire station problem, social network theory, and so on. Additionally, the DP has numerous variants, such as independent DP, total DP, k-domination, and so forth. However, there is a scarcity of quantum computing research on these variant problems. A possible reason for this is the lack of research on QUBO modeling for these issues. This paper investigates the QUBO modeling methods for the classic DP and its variants. Compared to previous studies, the QUBO modeling method we propose for the classic DP can utilize fewer qubits. This will lower the barrier for solving DP on quantum computers. At the same time, for many variants of DP problems, we provide their QUBO modeling methods for the first time. Our work will accelerate the entry of DP into the quantum era.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for Chemical Design and Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced computational chemistry research. However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large-scale foundation model specifically developed for chemistry, comprising up to 3 billion parameters. ChemFM is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using both full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple chemical tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.31% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Relaxation Engines for Optimizing to Minimum Energy Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades, several novel algorithms have been designed for finding critical points on PES and the minimum energy paths connecting them. This has led to considerably improve our understanding of reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the underlying processes. These methods implicitly rely on computation of energy and forces on the PES, which are usually obtained by computationally demanding wave-function or density-function based ab initio methods. To mitigate the computational cost, efficient optimization algorithms are needed. Herein, we present two new optimization algorithms: adaptively accelerated relaxation engine (AARE), an enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) scheme, and accelerated conjugate-gradient method (Acc-CG), an improved version of the traditional conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. We show the efficacy of these algorithms for unconstrained optimization on 2D and 4D test functions. Additionally, we also show the efficacy of these algorithms for optimizing an elastic band of images to the minimum energy path on two analytical potentials (LEPS-I and LEPS-II) and for HCN/CNH isomerization reaction. In all cases, we find that the new algorithms outperforms the standard and popular fast inertial relaxation engine (FIRE).</description>

      <title>Thermal Finite-Element Model of an Electric Machine Cooled by a Spray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for higher power density in electrical machines require better cooling strategies. Spray cooling is a very promising and relatively simple technology to apply, but involves extremely complicated physics. In this paper, a quasi-3D thermal finite-element model of a stator winding is created, by extrusion of a 2D cross-sectional finite-element model along the winding direction. The possible effects of spray cooling are simulated as a heat flux using an impedance boundary condition at the surface of the winding overhang. The results confirm the beneficial performance of spray cooling. The model indicates that spray cooling may allow a ten times larger power density than for standard air- or water-cooled machines.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Study of Leading-Edge Protuberance to Improve the Performance of NACA 0009 Blade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric NACA airfoils tend to undergo abrupt stall characteristics at higher angle of attacks. The abrupt stall has deteriorating effect on lift as well as the efficiency of the airfoils. Abruptness in stall restricts the airfoil to operate only at lower angle of attacks. So, in order to improve the efficiency of airfoils at higher angle of attacks and make it suitable for operation over higher range of angle of attacks, there are many flow control techniques. One such technique is addition of leading-edge protuberance. Leading-edge protuberances are the leading-edge modification of the wing. Leading-edge of the wing is modified with sinusoidal structural modification. This modification has two parameters i.e., Pitch and Amplitude. Many configurations of the protuberances can be obtained by changing the Pitch to Amplitude ratio of the protuberance. In the present work, the Reynolds number is 50k for NACA 0009. The Pitch to Amplitude ratio is varied from PAR1 to PAR27. PAR6 is found to be the better case which has higher lift and efficiency in the post-stall angle of attacks. At the deep stalling AOA of the baseline, i.e., at 13.6o, PAR6 is found to have the highest increase in lift and efficiency compared to the other post stalling AOAs with it having around 39.6% more lift and 27.3% more efficiency compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>MStableChain: Towards Multi-Native Stablecoins in EVM-Compatible Blockchain for Stable Fee and Mass Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, typically rely on a \emph{single volatile cryptocurrency for transaction fees}. This leads to fluctuating transaction fee prices and limits the flexibility of users' payment options. To address these issues, we propose MStableChain, which leverage multiple stablecoins as native tokens for transaction fee settlements, thus ensuring stable transaction fees and flexible payment options. To address the challenges of mass adoption and practicality, we propose several core designs. To maintain compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for mass adoption while supporting multiple native stablecoins, MStableChain employs a multi-currency units, multi-type RPCs mechanism. This mechanism enables the system to handle multiple stablecoins without altering the EVM or requiring changes to user applications. Furthermore, an oracle-based gas fee adjustment mechanism is proposed to manage exchange rates between different stablecoins, ensuring equitable transaction costs across various currencies. The system also introduces a secure, on-chain voting-based management protocol for the administrative functions related to these stablecoins. Experimental results from a prototype implementation demonstrate that MStableChain provides stable transaction fee prices, high effectiveness, and good usability.</description>

      <title>PyTOPress: Python code for topology optimization with design-dependent pressure loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Python is a low-cost and open-source substitute for the MATLAB programming language. This paper presents ``\texttt{PyTOPress}", a compact Python code for topology optimization that is primarily meant for pedagogical purposes. \texttt{PyTOPress}, based on the ``\texttt{TOPress}" MATLAB code \cite{kumar2023topress}, is built using the \texttt{NumPy} and \texttt{SciPy} libraries. The applied pressure load is modeled using the Darcy law and the drainage term. From the obtained pressure field, the constant nodal loads are found. The employed method makes it easier to compute the load sensitivity using the adjoint-variable method at a low cost. The topology optimization problems are resolved herein by minimizing the compliance of the structure with a constraint on material volume. The method of moving asymptotes is employed to update the design variables. The effectiveness and success of \texttt{PyTOPress} code are demonstrated by solving few design-dependent pressure loadbearing problems. The code is freely available at \url{https://github.com/PrabhatIn/PyTOPress}.</description>

      <title>Drone Acoustic Analysis for Predicting Psychoacoustic Annoyance via Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become widely used in various fields and industrial applications thanks to their low operational cost, compact size and wide accessibility. However, the noise generated by drone propellers has emerged as a significant concern. This may affect the public willingness to implement these vehicles in services that require operation in proximity to residential areas. The standard approaches to address this challenge include sound pressure measurements and noise characteristic analyses. The integration of Artificial Intelligence models in recent years has further streamlined the process by enhancing complex feature detection in drone acoustics data. This study builds upon prior research by examining the efficacy of various Deep Learning models in predicting Psychoacoustic Annoyance, an effective index for measuring perceived annoyance by human ears, based on multiple drone characteristics as input. This is accomplished by constructing a training dataset using precise measurements of various drone models with multiple microphones and analyzing flight data, maneuvers, drone physical characteristics, and perceived annoyance under realistic conditions. The aim of this research is to improve our understanding of drone noise, aid in the development of noise reduction techniques, and encourage the acceptance of drone usage on public spaces.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Machine Learning in Sports Betting: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sports betting industry has experienced rapid growth, driven largely by technological advancements and the proliferation of online platforms. Machine learning (ML) has played a pivotal role in the transformation of this sector by enabling more accurate predictions, dynamic odds-setting, and enhanced risk management for both bookmakers and bettors. This systematic review explores various ML techniques, including support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks, as applied in different sports such as soccer, basketball, tennis, and cricket. These models utilize historical data, in-game statistics, and real-time information to optimize betting strategies and identify value bets, ultimately improving profitability. For bookmakers, ML facilitates dynamic odds adjustment and effective risk management, while bettors leverage data-driven insights to exploit market inefficiencies. This review also underscores the role of ML in fraud detection, where anomaly detection models are used to identify suspicious betting patterns. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data quality, real-time decision-making, and the inherent unpredictability of sports outcomes remain. Ethical concerns related to transparency and fairness are also of significant importance. Future research should focus on developing adaptive models that integrate multimodal data and manage risk in a manner akin to financial portfolios. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the current applications of ML in sports betting, and highlights both the potential and the limitations of these technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Perishable and Non-Perishable Product Assignment to packaging lines in a Sustainable Manufacturing System: An AUGMECON2VIKOR Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying appropriate manufacturing systems for products can be considered a pivotal manufacturing task that contributes to the optimization of operational and planning activities. It has gained importance in the food industry due to the distinct constraints and considerations posed by perishable and non-perishable items in this problem. Hence, this study proposes a new mathematical model - according to knowledge discovery as well as an assignment model to optimize manufacturing systems for perishable, non-perishable, and hybrid products tailored to meet their unique characteristics. In the presented model, three objective functions are taken into account: (1) minimizing the - production costs by assigning the products to the right set of manufacturing systems, (2) maximizing the product quality by assigning the products to the systems, and (3) minimizing the total - CO2 emissions of the machines. A numerical example is utilized to evaluate the performance of AUGMECON2VIKOR compared to AUGMECON2. The results show that AUGMECON2VIKOR obtains superior Pareto solutions across all objective functions. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis explores the positive green impacts, influencing both cost and quality.</description>

      <title>HyperCAN: Hypernetwork-Driven Deep Parameterized Constitutive Models for Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce HyperCAN, a machine learning framework that utilizes hypernetworks to construct adaptable constitutive artificial neural networks for a wide range of beam-based metamaterials exhibiting diverse mechanical behavior under finite deformations. HyperCAN integrates an input convex network that models the nonlinear stress-strain map of a truss lattice, while ensuring adherence to fundamental mechanics principles, along with a hypernetwork that dynamically adjusts the parameters of the convex network as a function of the lattice topology and geometry. This unified framework demonstrates robust generalization in predicting the mechanical behavior of previously unseen metamaterial designs and loading scenarios well beyond the training domain. We show how HyperCAN can be integrated into multiscale simulations to accurately capture the highly nonlinear responses of large-scale truss metamaterials, closely matching fully resolved simulations while significantly reducing computational costs. This offers new efficient opportunities for the multiscale design and optimization of truss metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Blue and Green-Mode Energy-Efficient Nanoparticle-Based Chemiresistive Sensor Array Realized by Rapid Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates the development of optimized nanoparticle-based Chemiresistive Sensor (CRS) arrays that are energy-efficient, specific, and sensitive. This study introduces an optimization strategy that employs a rapid ensemble learning-based model committee approach to achieve these goals. Utilizing machine learning models such as Elastic Net Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost, among others, the strategy identifies the most impactful sensors in a CRS array for accurate classification. A weighted voting mechanism is introduced to aggregate the models' opinions in sensor selection, thereby setting up two distinct working modes, termed "Blue" and "Green". The Blue mode operates with all sensors for maximum detection capability, while the Green mode selectively activates only key sensors, significantly reducing energy consumption without compromising detection accuracy. The strategy is validated through theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy. The employed optimization strategy elevates the detection capability of CRS arrays while also pushing it closer to theoretical limits, promising significant implications for the development of low-cost, easily fabricable next-generation IoT sensor terminals.</description>
