      <title>Deductive Systems for Logic Programs with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In answer set programming, two groups of rules are considered strongly equivalent if they have the same meaning in any context. Strong equivalence of two programs can be sometimes established by deriving rules of each program from rules of the other in an appropriate deductive system. This paper shows how to extend this method of proving strong equivalence to programs containing the counting aggregate.</description>

      <title>Chopping More Finely: Finite Countermodels in Modal Logic via the Subdivision Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method, the Subdivision Construction, for proving the finite model property (the fmp) for broad classes of modal logics and modal rule systems. The construction builds on the framework of stable canonical rules, and produces a finite modal algebra (finite modal space) that will be a finite countermodel of such rules, yielding the fmp. We apply the Subdivision Construction for proving the fmp for logics and rule systems axiomatized by stable canonical formulas and rules of finite modal algebras of finite height. We also observe that these logics and rule systems are union-splittings in corresponding lattices. As a consequence, we identify a class of union-splittings in $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K4})$ with the degree of Kripke incompleteness 1.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Verification of Quantum Circuits (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully automatic framework for verifying relational properties of parameterized quantum programs, i.e., a program that, given an input size, generates a corresponding quantum circuit. We focus on verifying input-output correctness as well as equivalence. At the core of our approach is a new automata model, synchronized weighted tree automata (SWTAs), which compactly and precisely captures the infinite families of quantum states produced by parameterized programs. We introduce a class of transducers to model quantum gate semantics and develop composition algorithms for constructing transducers of parameterized circuits. Verification is reduced to functional inclusion or equivalence checking between SWTAs, for which we provide decision procedures. Our implementation demonstrates both the expressiveness and practical efficiency of the framework by verifying a diverse set of representative parameterized quantum programs with verification times ranging from milliseconds to seconds.</description>

      <title>Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning.
  In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them.
  We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TARK conference (Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge) is a conference that aims to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, game theory, decision theory, philosophy, logic, linguistics, and cognitive science. Its goal is to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge.
  Previous conferences have been held biennially around the world since 1986, on the initiative of Joe Halpern (Cornell University). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, uncertainty, awareness, bounded rationality, common sense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems.
  Information about TARK is available at http://www.tark.org/.
  These proceedings contain the papers that have been accepted for presentation at the Twentieth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK 2025), held July 14--16, 2025, at Heinrich-Heine-Universit\"at, D\"usseldorf, Germany.

      <title>Verifying Numerical Methods with Isabelle/HOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning pipelines are built on numerical algorithms. Reliable numerical methods are thus a prerequisite for trustworthy machine learning and cyber-physical systems. Therefore, we contribute a framework for verified numerical methods in Isabelle/HOL based on ITrees. Our user-friendly specification language enables the direct declaration of numerical programs that can be annotated with variants and invariants for reasoning about correctness specifications. The generated verification conditions can be discharged via automated proof methods and lemmas from the HOL-Analysis library. The ITrees foundation interacts with Isabelle's code generator to export source code. This provides an end-to-end path from formal specifications with machine-checked guarantees to executable sources. We illustrate the process of modelling numerical methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the verification by focusing on two well-known methods, the bisection method and the fixed-point iteration method. We also contribute crucial extensions to the libraries of formalised mathematics required for this objective: higher-order derivatives and Taylor's theorem in Peano form. Finally, we qualitatively evaluate the use of the framework for verifying numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Profile Generators: A Link between the Narrative and the Binary Matrix Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health disorders, particularly cognitive disorders defined by deficits in cognitive abilities, are described in detail in the DSM-5, which includes definitions and examples of signs and symptoms. A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.</description>

      <title>Softmax Transformers are Turing-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are known to be Turing-complete. However, it is an open problem whether softmax attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are Turing-complete. In this paper, we prove a stronger result that length-generalizable softmax CoT transformers are Turing-complete. More precisely, our Turing-completeness proof goes via the CoT extension of the Counting RASP (C-RASP), which correspond to softmax CoT transformers that admit length generalization. We prove Turing-completeness for CoT C-RASP with causal masking over a unary alphabet (more generally, for letter-bounded languages). While we show this is not Turing-complete for arbitrary languages, we prove that its extension with relative positional encoding is Turing-complete for arbitrary languages. We empirically validate our theory by training transformers for languages requiring complex (non-linear) arithmetic reasoning.</description>

      <title>How to play the Accordion: Uniformity and the (non-)conservativity of the linear approximation of the {\lambda}-calculus (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02785v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twenty years after its introduction by Ehrhard and Regnier, differentiation in $\lambda$-calculus and in linear logic is now a celebrated tool. In particular, it allows to establish a Taylor expansion formula for various $\lambda$-calculi, hence providing a theory of linear approximations for these calculi. In the pure $\lambda$-calculus, the linear approximants of $\lambda$-terms supporting this Taylor expansion are the terms of a so-called resource calculus, which is equipped with a finitary (strongly normalising) reduction; and the efficiency of this linear approximation is expressed by results stating that the (possibly) infinitary $\beta$-reduction of $\lambda$-terms is simulated by the reduction of their Taylor expansions, which is induced by the iterated reduction of resource terms. In terms of rewriting systems, resource reduction (operating on infinite linear combinations of Taylor approximants) is an extension of $\beta$-reduction.
  In this article, we address the converse property, conservativity: do all reductions between Taylor expansions arise from actual $\beta$-reductions? We show that if we restrict the setting to finite terms and $\beta$-reduction sequences, then the linear approximation is conservative. However, as soon as one allows infinitary reduction sequences this property is broken. We design a counter-example, the Accordion. Then we show how restricting the reduction of the Taylor approximants allows to build a conservative extension of the $\beta$-reduction preserving good simulation properties; this restriction relies on uniformity, a property that was already at the core of Ehrhard and Regnier's pioneering work. Finally, we extend our work to $\beta\bot$-reductions, which play a key role in $\lambda$-calculus as they relate a $\lambda$-term to its B\"ohm tree.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Concurrent Reasoning in Outcome Logic: Independence, Conditioning, and Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although randomization has long been used in distributed computing, formal methods for reasoning about probabilistic concurrent programs have lagged behind. No existing program logics can express specifications about the full distributions of outcomes resulting from programs that are both probabilistic and concurrent. To address this, we introduce Probabilistic Concurrent Outcome Logic (pcOL), which incorporates ideas from concurrent and probabilistic separation logics into Outcome Logic to introduce new compositional reasoning principles. At its core, pcOL reinterprets the rules of Concurrent Separation Logic in a setting where separation models probabilistic independence, so as to compositionally describe joint distributions over variables in concurrent threads. Reasoning about outcomes also proves crucial, as case analysis is often necessary to derive precise information about threads that rely on randomized shared state. We demonstrate pcOL on a variety of examples, including to prove almost sure termination of unbounded loops.</description>

      <title>A bialgebraic characterization of symmetric powers in $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In any symmetric monoidal category, the $n$-th (co)equalizer symmetric power of an object $A$ is the (co)equalizer of all the permutations from $A^{\otimes n}$ to itself. If the symmetric monoidal category is $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear, that is, enriched over $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-modules, the notions of $n$-th equalizer symmetric power and $n$-th coequalizer symmetric power are equivalent. In this context, the $n$-th symmetric power of $A$ can be described as the intermediate object $A_n$ in a splitting of the idempotent $\frac{1}{n!}\underset{\sigma \in S_n}{\sum}\sigma\colon A^{\otimes n} \rightarrow A^{\otimes n}$. We define a permutation splitting as a countable family of such splittings.
  The main goal of this paper is to prove two theorems. The first theorem exhibits in any $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal category a bijection between operations making a graded object $(A_n)_{n \ge 0}$ into a permutation splitting and operations making this graded object into a bialgebraic structure that we call a binomial bimonoid. Binomial bimonoids can be defined in any additive symmetric monoidal category. The second theorem shows that, in any $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal category, the biassociativity and bicommutativity axioms may be omitted from the definition of a binomial bimonoid.
  We then show that being a binomial bimonoid in a $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal category is a property: two binomial bimonoids are isomorphic whenever their underlying graded objects are isomorphic. This result does not extend to arbitrary additive symmetric monoidal categories since both the one-variable polynomial algebra and the one-variable divided power polynomial algebra over a field $k$ of positive characteristic are non-isomorphic binomial $k$-bialgebras with isomorphic underlying $\mathbb{N}$-graded vector spaces.</description>
