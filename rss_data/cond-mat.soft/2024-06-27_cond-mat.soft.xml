      <title>Onset of slow dynamics in dense suspensions of active colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow relaxation and heterogeneous dynamics are characteristic features of glasses. The presence of glassy dynamics in nonequilibrium systems, such as active matter, is of significant interest due to its implications for living systems and material science. In this study, we use dense suspensions of self-propelled Janus particles moving on a substrate to investigate the onset of slow dynamics. Our findings show that dense active suspensions exhibit several hallmark features of slow dynamics similar to systems approaching equilibrium. The relaxation time fits well with the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation, and the system displays heterogeneous dynamics. Furthermore, increasing the activity leads to faster relaxation of the system, and the glass transition density predicted by the VFT equation shifts to higher densities. The measurement of the cage length and persistence length reveal they are of the same order over the range of activities explored in our study. These results are in agreement with recent particle simulations.</description>

      <title>Rapid Polymorphic Screening using Sessile Microdroplets: Competitive Nucleation of Mannitol Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a rapid polymorphic screening approach based on contracting sessile microdroplets which offers several advantages: (1) achieves very high supersaturation to facilitate formation of metastable forms (2) allows systematic labeling of samples (3) gives access to statistical distribution of polymorphic selectivity as a function of experimental conditions (4) ensures the formation of crystal for each droplet, addressing the problem of uncrystallized droplets in traditional microfluidics. We studied the competitive nucleation of D-mannitol polymorphs and investigated the effect of droplet volume on polymorphic selectivity. We showed that our observed polymorph distributions at different volumes are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of classical nucleation theory except for very small volumes where thermodynamic confinement or surface effects could play a substantial role. Overall, our microfluidic approach can be a promising tool not only for routine screening of pharmaceutical polymorphs in the industrial context but also in the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying the competitive nucleation of polymorphs.</description>

      <title>On the relative packing densities of pistachios and pistachio shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an appetizer bowl full of $N$ pistachios, what is the optimal size of the container -- neither too small, nor too big -- needed for accommodating the resulting $2N$ non-edible pistachio shells? Performing a simple experiment we find that, provided the shells are densely packed, such container needs only be slightly more than half ($\approx 0.57$) that of the original pistachio bowl. If loosely packed this number increases to $\approx 0.73$. Our results are discussed in light of existing literature on packing ellipsoids and spherical caps.</description>

      <title>Gauge Freedom and Objective Rates in the Morphodynamics of Fluid Deformable Surfaces: the Jaumann Rate vs. the Material Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphodynamic descriptions of fluid deformable surfaces are relevant for a range of biological and soft matter phenomena, spanning materials that can be passive or active, as well as ordered or topological. However, a principled, geometric formulation of the correct hydrodynamic equations has remained opaque, with objective rates proving a central, contentious issue. We argue that this is due to a conflation of several important notions that must be disambiguated when describing fluid deformable surfaces. These are the Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives on fluid motion, and three different types of gauge freedom: in the ambient space; in the parameterisation of the surface, and; in the choice of frame field on the surface. We clarify these ideas, and show that objective rates in fluid deformable surfaces are time derivatives that are invariant under the first of these gauge freedoms, and which also preserve the structure of the ambient metric. The latter condition reduces a potentially infinite number of possible objective rates to only two: the material derivative and the Jaumann rate. The material derivative is invariant under the Galilean group, and therefore applies to velocities, whose rate captures the conservation of momentum. The Jaumann derivative is invariant under all time-dependent isometries, and therefore applies to local order parameters, or symmetry-broken variables, such as the nematic $Q$-tensor. We provide examples of material and Jaumann rates in two different frame fields that are pertinent to the current applications of the fluid mechanics of deformable surfaces.</description>

      <title>Estimate of entropy generation rate can spatiotemporally resolve the active nature of cell flickering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the short-time inference scheme (Manikandan, Gupta and Krishnamurthy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 120603, 2020), obtained within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, to infer a lower-bound to entropy generation rate from flickering data generated by Interference Reflection Microscopy of HeLA cells. We can clearly distinguish active cell membranes from their ATP depleted selves and even spatio-temporally resolve activity down to the scale of about one $\mu$m. Our estimate of activity is model--independent.</description>

      <title>Real-space model for activated processes in rejuvenation and memory behavior of glassy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer an alternative real-space description, based purely on activated processes, for the understanding of relaxation dynamics in hierarchical landscapes. To this end, we use the cluster model, a coarse-grained lattice model of a jammed system, to analyze rejuvenation and memory effects during aging after a hard quench. In this model, neighboring particles on a lattice aggregate through local interactions into clusters that fragment with a probability based on their size. Despite the simplicity of the cluster model, it has been shown to reproduce salient observables of the aging dynamics in colloidal systems, such as those accounting for particle mobility and displacements. Here, we probe the model for more complex quench protocols and show that it exhibits rejuvenation and memory effects similar to those attributed to the complex hierarchical structure of a glassy energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Marangoni droplets of dextran in PEG solution and its motile change due to coil-globule transition of coexisting DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motile droplets using Marangoni convection are attracting attention for their potential as cell-mimicking small robots. However, the motion of droplets relative to the internal and external environments that generate Marangoni convection has not been quantitatively described. This study used an aqueous two-phase system (polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran) in an elongated chamber to generate motile dextran droplets in a constant PEG concentration gradient. We demonstrated that dextran droplets move by Marangoni convection, resulting from the PEG concentration gradient and the active transport of PEG and dextran into and out of the droplet. Furthermore, by spontaneously incorporating long DNA into the dextran droplets, we achieved cell-like motility changes controlled by coexisting environment-sensing molecules. The DNA changes its position within the droplet and motile speed in response to external conditions. In the presence of Mg2+, the coil-globule transition of DNA inside the droplet accelerates the motile speed due to the decrease in the droplet's dynamic viscosity. Globule DNA condenses at the rear part of the droplet along the convection, while coil DNA moves away from the droplet's central axis, separating the dipole convections. These results provide a blueprint for designing autonomous small robots using phase-separated droplets, which change the mobility and molecular distribution within the droplet in reaction to the environment. It will also open unexplored areas of self-assembly mechanisms through phase separation under convections, such as intracellular phase separation.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous structure and dynamics of water in a hydrated collagen microfibril</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12929v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collagen type I is well-known for its outstanding mechanical properties which it inherits from its hierarchical structure. Collagen type I fibrils may be viewed as an heterogeneous material made of protein, macromolecules (such as glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans) and water. Water content modulates the properties of these heterofibrils. Yet, the properties of water and the fine interactions of water with the protein constituent of these nanocomposites have only received limited attention. Here, we propose to model collagen type I fibrils as an hydrated structure made of tropocollagen molecules assembled in a microfibril crystal. We perform large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the hydration of collagen fibrils beyond the onset of disassembly. We found that the structural and dynamic properties of water vary strongly with the level of hydration of the microfibril. More importantly, we found that the properties vary spatially within the 67 nm D-spacing periodic structure. Alteration of the structural and dynamical properties of the collagen microfibril occur first in the gap region. Overall, we identify that the change in the role of water molecules from glue to lubricant between tropocollagen molecules arises around 100% hydration while the microfibril begins to disassemble beyond 130% water content. Our findings are supported by a decrease in hydrogen bonding, recovery of bulk water properties and amorphisation of the tropocollagen molecules packing. Our simulations reveal the structure and dynamics of hydrated collagen fibrils with unprecedented spatial resolution from physiological conditions to disassembly. Beyond the process of self-assembly and the emergence of mechanical properties of collagen type I fibrils, our results may also provide new insights in mineralization of collagen fibrils.</description>

      <title>Quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain influenced by atomic charges in water model using orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed temperature-dependent quasiphase transition of the single-file water chain confined within a carbon nanotube in experiments has been validated by simple lattice theory and molecular dynamic simulations. It has been pointed out that atomic charges in water model is an important issue, yet how the values will affect the structural details and thermodynamic properties of the quasiphase transition has not been fully revealed. In this work, we performed orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble to explore the effect of atomic charges in SPC/E water model on the quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain. Based on the atomic charge values reported from literature, three distinct quasiphases are reproduced, comprising a fully hydrogen-bonded water chain at lower temperatures, a more ordered dipolar orientation along the x-axis at intermediate temperatures, and a completely disordered structure at higher temperatures. Then by increasing the atomic charge value, we find that the fragmentation of the entire water chain into shorter water segments, the orientational ordering of water dipoles, and the transition towards complete disorder are all inhibited. Consequently, the transition temperatures between three quasiphases have been shifted to higher temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the increased atomic charge values enhance the hydrogen bonding between neighbouring water molecules also the electrostatic attraction within the water chain, leading to a longer water dipole correlation length even at higher temperatures. These findings shed light on the vital role of atomic charges in water models and also the electrostatic interaction in regulating the orientational ordering of water molecules under nanoconfinement.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any differentiable scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result--a time-integrated generalized speed limit--reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g.\ in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Conformable Derivative Approach to Granular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proper modeling of complex systems requires innovative mathematical tools. In this sense, we sought to use deformed or fractal derivatives for studying the dynamics of systems, particularly those, such as granular gases, in which the description of the dynamics can be done by using the stretched exponential probability densities. In this contribution we draw up three results of this application of mathematical tools. The first result shows that when we use constraints with finite momentum and the principle of maximum entropy, the Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts function, known as stretched exponential, emerges naturally and in a simpler way, when compared to results in the literature. Next, we obtain generalized expressions for the Langevin equation, as well as its solutions for three different deformed derivatives, including those connected with nonaddictive statistical mechanics. The Haff's-like law for granular gases are obtained. Next, we calculate the partition function $Z$ for a granular gas system by building up the probability density in terms of the stretched exponential function. From this partition function, we determine the internal energy of the system as well as the specific heat, both dependent on temperature. The consistency with classical approach of kinetic theory for ideal gases was verified.</description>
