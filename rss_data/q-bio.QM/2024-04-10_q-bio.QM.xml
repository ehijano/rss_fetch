      <title>Oxygen, Angiogenesis, Cancer and Immune Interplay in Breast Tumor Micro-Environment: A Computational Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most challenging global health problems among women. This study investigates the intricate breast tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics utilizing data from Mammary-specific Polyomavirus Middle T Antigen Overexpression mouse models (MMTV-PyMT). It incorporates Endothelial Cells (ECs), oxygen, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGF) to examine the interplay of angiogenesis, hypoxia, VEGF, and the immune cells in cancer progression. We introduce an approach to impute the immune cell fractions within the TME using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from MMTV-PyMT mice. We further quantify our analysis by estimating cell counts using cell size data and laboratory findings from existing literature. Parameter estimation is carried out via a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA). Our simulations reveal various TME behaviors, emphasizing the critical role of adipocytes, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and oxygen transport in driving immune responses and cancer progression. The global sensitivity analyses highlight potential therapeutic intervention points, such as VEGFs' critical role in EC growth and oxygen transportation and severe hypoxia's effect on the cancer and the total number of cells. The VEGF-mediated production rate of ECs shows an essential time-dependent impact, highlighting the importance of early intervention in slowing cancer progression. These findings align with the observations from the clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of VEGF inhibitors and suggest a timely intervention for better outcomes.</description>

      <title>The CAST package for training and assessment of spatial prediction models in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One key task in environmental science is to map environmental variables continuously in space or even in space and time. Machine learning algorithms are frequently used to learn from local field observations to make spatial predictions by estimating the value of the variable of interest in places where it has not been measured. However, the application of machine learning strategies for spatial mapping involves additional challenges compared to "non-spatial" prediction tasks that often originate from spatial autocorrelation and from training data that are not independent and identically distributed.
  In the past few years, we developed a number of methods to support the application of machine learning for spatial data which involves the development of suitable cross-validation strategies for performance assessment and model selection, spatial feature selection, and methods to assess the area of applicability of the trained models. The intention of the CAST package is to support the application of machine learning strategies for predictive mapping by implementing such methods and making them available for easy integration into modelling workflows.
  Here we introduce the CAST package and its core functionalities. At the case study of mapping plant species richness, we will go through the different steps of the modelling workflow and show how CAST can be used to support more reliable spatial predictions.</description>

      <title>Quiver Laplacians and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of selecting the most relevant features of a given dataset arises ubiquitously in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, features found to be of high importance for the entire dataset may not be relevant to subsets of interest, and vice versa. Given a feature selector and a fixed decomposition of the data into subsets, we describe a method for identifying selected features which are compatible with the decomposition into subsets. We achieve this by re-framing the problem of finding compatible features to one of finding sections of a suitable quiver representation. In order to approximate such sections, we then introduce a Laplacian operator for quiver representations valued in Hilbert spaces. We provide explicit bounds on how the spectrum of a quiver Laplacian changes when the representation and the underlying quiver are modified in certain natural ways. Finally, we apply this machinery to the study of peak-calling algorithms which measure chromatin accessibility in single-cell data. We demonstrate that eigenvectors of the associated quiver Laplacian yield locally and globally compatible features.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quasiconformal morphodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal imaging of biological epithelial structures yields shape data at discrete time points, leading to a natural question: how can we reconstruct the most likely path of growth patterns consistent with these discrete observations? We present a physically plausible framework to solve this inverse problem by creating a framework that generalizes quasiconformal maps to quasiconformal flows. By allowing for the spatio-temporal variation of the shear and dilatation fields during the growth process, subject to regulatory mechanisms, we are led to a type of generalized Ricci flow. When guided by observational data associated with surface shape as a function of time, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. Deploying our data-driven algorithmic approach to the shape of insect wings, leaves and even sculpted faces, we show how optimal quasiconformal flows allow us to characterize the morphogenesis of a range of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium microbial dynamics unveil a new macroecological pattern beyond Taylor's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive analytical benchmark, relying on Fokker-Planck formalism, to study microbial dynamics in presence of both biotic and abiotic forces. In equilibrium, we observe a balance between the two kinds of forces, leading to no correlations between species abundances. This implies that real microbiomes, where correlations have been observed, operate out of equilibrium. Therefore, we analyze non-equilibrium dynamics, presenting an ansatz for an approximate solution that embodies the complex interplay of forces in the system. This solution is consistent with Taylor's law as a coarse-grained approximation of the relation between species abundance and variance, but implies subtler effects, predicting unobserved structure beyond Taylor's law. Motivated by this theoretical prediction, we refine the analysis of existing metagenomic data, unveiling a novel universal macroecological pattern. Finally, we speculate on the physical origin of Taylor's law: building upon an analogy with Brownian motion theory, we propose that Taylor's law emerges as a Fluctuation-Growth relation resulting from equipartition of environmental resources among microbial species.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying numbers of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. This establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <title>Rapid, antibiotic incubation-free determination of tuberculosis drug resistance using machine learning and Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05653</link>

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's deadliest infectious disease, with over 1.5 million deaths annually and 10 million new cases reported each year. The causative organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can take nearly 40 days to culture, a required step to determine the pathogen's antibiotic susceptibility. Both rapid identification of Mtb and rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) are essential for effective patient treatment and combating antimicrobial resistance. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, culture-free, and antibiotic incubation-free drug susceptibility test for TB using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning. We collect few-to-single-cell Raman spectra from over 25,000 cells of the MtB complex strain Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) resistant to one of the four mainstay anti-TB drugs, isoniazid, rifampicin, moxifloxacin and amikacin, as well as a pan susceptible wildtype strain. By training a neural network on this data, we classify the antibiotic resistance profile of each strain, both on dried samples and in patient sputum samples. On dried samples, we achieve &gt;98% resistant versus susceptible classification accuracy across all 5 BCG strains. In patient sputum samples, we achieve ~79% average classification accuracy. We develop a feature recognition algorithm in order to verify that our machine learning model is using biologically relevant spectral features to assess the resistance profiles of our mycobacterial strains. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be deployed in resource-limited settings by developing a low-cost, portable Raman microscope that costs &lt;$5000. We show how this instrument and our machine learning model enables combined microscopy and spectroscopy for accurate few-to-single-cell drug susceptibility testing of BCG.</description>
