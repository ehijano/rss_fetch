      <title>Evidence of Charge Multiplication in Thin $25 \mathrm{\mu m} \times 25 \mathrm{\mu m}$ Pitch 3D Silicon Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization measurements of $25 \mathrm{\mu m} \times 25 \mathrm{\mu m}$ pitch 3D silicon sensors are presented, for devices with active thickness of $150\mu$m. Evidence of charge multiplication caused by impact ionization below the breakdown voltage is observed. Small-pitch 3D silicon sensors have potential as high precision 4D tracking detectors that are also able to withstand radiation fluences beyond $\mathrm{10^{16} n_{eq}/cm^2}$, for use at future facilities such as the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, the Electron-Ion Collider, and the Future Circular Collider. Characteristics of these devices are compared to those for similar sensors of pitch $50 \mathrm{\mu m} \times 50 \mathrm{\mu m}$, showing comparable charge collection at low voltage, and acceptable leakage current, depletion voltage, breakdown voltage, and capacitance despite the extremely small cell size. The unirradiated $25 \mathrm{\mu m} \times 25 \mathrm{\mu m}$ sensors exhibit charge multiplication above about 90 V reverse bias, while, as predicted, no multiplication is observed in the $50 \mathrm{\mu m} \times 50 \mathrm{\mu m}$ sensors below their breakdown voltage. The maximum gain observed below breakdown is 1.33.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-linearity in AH 2700A Capacitance Bridges with sub-ppm level uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability and non-linearity of a commercial AH 2700A capacitance bridge were studied beyond its specified capabilities using the Thompson-Lampard Calculable Capacitor (TLCC) at LNE. The TLCC allows for continuous variation of measured capacitance between 0.4 pF and 1.2 pF with a resolution of 2 parts in $10^{7}$ and stability better than 1 part in $10^{9}$ over 2 days. The study aimed to determine root cause of the saw-tooth non-linearity pattern observed in the AH 2700A capacitance bridge. This pattern becomes apparent when the internal calibration is no longer valid, indicating deviations in the bridge circuit. Additionally, the dependence of capacitance non-linearity on various factors such as frequency and capacitance value are described. This work enables automatic calibration of the commercial bridge with an uncertainty of sub-ppm level and allows for quick evaluation of TLCC's non-linearity and monitoring of any changes over time through in-situ measurements.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Inverted Pyramid 3-axis Silicon Hall Effect Magnetic Sensor With Offset Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microelectronic magnetic sensors are essential in diverse applications, including automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics. Hall-effect devices hold the largest share of the magnetic sensor market, and they are particularly valued for their reliability, low cost and CMOS compatibility. This paper introduces a novel 3-axis Hall-effect sensor element based on an inverted pyramid structure, realized by leveraging MEMS micromachining and CMOS processing. The devices are manufactured by etching the pyramid openings with TMAH and implanting the sloped walls with n-dopants to define the active area. Through the use of various bias-sense detection modes, the device is able to detect both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields within a single compact structure. In addition, the offset can be significantly reduced by one to three orders of magnitude by employing the current-spinning method. The device presented in this work demonstrated high in-plane and out-of-plane current- and voltage-related sensitivities ranging between 64.1 to 198 V A$^{-1}$ T$^{-1}$ and 14.8 to 21.4 mV V$^{-1}$ T$^{-1}$, with crosstalk below 3.7 %. The sensor exhibits a thermal noise floor which corresponds to approximately 0.5 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{Hz}$ at 1.31 V supply. This novel Hall-effect sensor represents a promising and simpler alternative to existing state-of-the-art 3-axis magnetic sensors, offering a viable solution for precise and reliable magnetic field sensing in various applications such as position feedback and power monitoring.</description>

      <title>First studies on cascaded dual-phase liquid hole-multipliers in xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Challenges in scaling up noble-liquid time projection chambers prompted the exploration of new detection concepts. The liquid hole-multiplier (LHM) was introduced as a potential component, enabling the detection of ionization electrons and VUV photons. Prior studies focused on perforated electrodes coated with CsI immersed in the liquid and electroluminescence amplification produced on a bubble trapped underneath. However, the performance was hindered by electron transfer across the liquid-gas interface. Here, we explored a bubble-free variant, placing a CsI-coated Thick Gas Electron Multiplier electrode below the liquid-gas interface to improve the transfer efficiency across it. Results show &gt;5-fold improvement in the S1'/S2 ratio (a proxy for the photon detection efficiency (PDE)) compared to the bubble-assisted LHM. Although the achieved PDE is still below expectation ($\sim$4%), we propose potential improvements to enhance the performance of this detector.</description>

      <title>Holographic Air-quality Monitor (HAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the holographic air-quality monitor (HAM) system, uniquely tailored for monitoring large particulate matter (PM) over 10 um in diameter, i.e., particles critical for disease transmission and public health but overlooked by most commercial PM sensors. The HAM system utilizes a lensless digital inline holography (DIH) sensor combined with a deep learning model, enabling real-time detection of PMs, with greater than 97% true positive rate at less than 0.6% false positive rate, and analysis of PMs by size and morphology at a sampling rate of 26 liters per minute (LPM), for a wide range of particle concentrations up to 4000 particles/L. Such throughput not only significantly outperforms traditional imaging-based sensors but also rivals some lower-fidelity, non-imaging sensors. Additionally, the HAM system is equipped with additional sensors for smaller PMs and various air quality conditions, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of indoor air quality. The performance of the DIH sensor within the HAM system was evaluated through comparison with brightfield microscopy, showing high concordance in size measurements. The efficacy of the DIH sensor was also demonstrated in two two-hour experiments under different environments simulating practical conditions with one involving distinct PM-generating events. These tests highlighted the HAM system's advanced capability to differentiate PM events from background noise and its exceptional sensitivity to irregular, large-sized PMs of low concentration.</description>

      <title>Factors influencing quantum evaporation of helium from polar semiconductors from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there is much indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM), to date it has evaded detection. Current efforts focus on DM masses over $\sim$GeV -- to push the sensitivity of DM searches to lower masses, new DM targets and detection schemes are needed. In this work, we focus on the latter - a novel detection scheme recently proposed to detect ~10-100 meV phonons in polar target materials. Previous work showed that well-motivated models of DM can interact with polar semiconductors to produce an athermal population of phonons. This new sensing scheme proposes that these phonons then facilitate quantum evaporation of $^3$He from a van der Waals film deposited on the target material. However, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still unclear, with several uncertainties related to the precise rate of evaporation and how it can be controlled. In this work, we use \textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compare the adsorption energies of helium atoms on a polar target material, sodium iodide (NaI), to understand the underlying evaporation physics. We explore the role of surface termination, monolayer coverage and elemental species on the rate of He evaporation from the target material. Using this, we discuss the optimal target features for He-evaporation experiments and their range of tunability through chemical and physical modifications such as applied field and surface termination.</description>

      <title>CLOWN: The PASO cloud detection for optimization of automatic optical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbiting space objects have become in the last decade a major nuisance impacting ground astronomy and orbiting space assets, from observatories to satellites and space stations. In particular with the rise of the satellite population in Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), space objects are becoming an even bigger threat and a strong problem to astronomical observations. To tackle these threats several coordinated surveillance networks composed of dedicated sensors (telescopes, radars and laser ranging facilities) track and survey space objects, from debris to active satellites. As part of the European Space Surveillance \&amp; Tracking (EU-SST) network, Portugal is developing the PAmpilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO), with both radio and optical telescopes dedicated to the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) domain, deployed at a Dark Sky destination. To optimize telescope survey time, we developed {\tt{CLOWN}} (CLOud Watcher at Night), an application interface that automatically monitors clouds in real time. This software can correctly trace clouds positions in the sky, provides accurate pointing information to the observation planning of the optical telescope to avoid cloudy areas. {\tt{CLOWN}} only requires the use of an all-sky camera, which is already a norm in observatories with optical telescopes and can be used with any camera, including those for which no information about its model specification do exist. {\tt{CLOWN}} does not require great computing power and it does not require the installation of additional equipment. {\tt{CLOWN}} results are very promising and confirm that the app can correctly identify clouds in a variety of different conditions and cloud types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an algorithm dedicated to timing reconstruction in highly granular calorimeters(HGC). The performance of this algorithm is evaluated on an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) with geometries comparable to the electromagnetic compartment (CE-E) of the CMS endcap calorimeter upgrade at HL-LHC and conceptual Particle Flow oriented ECAL's for future Higgs factories. The time response of individual channel is parameterized according to the CMS experimental result. The particle Time-of-Flight (ToF) can be measured with a resolution of $5\sim20 \;\rm{ps}$ for electromagnetic (EM) showers and $80\sim 160 \;\rm{ps}$ for hadronic showers above 1 GeV. The presented algorithm provides comparable reconstruction with the $E_{\mathrm{hit}}^2$ weighting strategy and can significantly improve the time resolution compared to a simple averaging of the fast component of the time spectrum. The effects of three detector configurations are also quantified in this study. ToF resolution depends linearly on the timing resolution of a single silicon sensor and improves statistically with increasing incident particle energy. The timing layers at depth of $6\sim 9$ radiation lengths provide higher timing performance for EM showers. A clustering algorithm that vetoes isolated hits improves ToF resolution.</description>

      <title>Portable acceleration of CMS computing workflows with coprocessors as a service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing demands for large scientific experiments, such as the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, will increase dramatically in the next decades. To complement the future performance increases of software running on central processing units (CPUs), explorations of coprocessor usage in data processing hold great potential and interest. Coprocessors are a class of computer processors that supplement CPUs, often improving the execution of certain functions due to architectural design choices. We explore the approach of Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) and study the deployment of this as-a-service approach in large-scale data processing. In the studies, we take a data processing workflow of the CMS experiment and run the main workflow on CPUs, while offloading several machine learning (ML) inference tasks onto either remote or local coprocessors, specifically graphics processing units (GPUs). With experiments performed at Google Cloud, the Purdue Tier-2 computing center, and combinations of the two, we demonstrate the acceleration of these ML algorithms individually on coprocessors and the corresponding throughput improvement for the entire workflow. This approach can be easily generalized to different types of coprocessors and deployed on local CPUs without decreasing the throughput performance. We emphasize that the SONIC approach enables high coprocessor usage and enables the portability to run workflows on different types of coprocessors.</description>

      <title>Scintillating low-temperature calorimeters for direct dark matter search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of an unambiguous signal for thermally produced dark matter particles in direct detection, indirect detection, and collider searches calls for broadening the search strategies by probing a wider range of dark matter masses with different detection techniques. One of the most common approaches is to search for nuclear recoils induced by dark matter particles scattering off the target material's nuclei. Low-temperature detectors have proven to provide the required performance to probe dark matter masses from 100 MeV/c$^2$ to 100 GeV/c$^2$ via this channel. Using scintillation light as an ancillary channel is a powerful tool for particle identification and background suppression at the keV-recoil energy scale. The CRESST-III experiment, employing scintillating cryogenic detectors with highly sensitive transition edge sensors and multi-target absorber crystals, achieved unprecedented sensitivities to explore sub-GeV dark matter masses. COSINUS, instead, is a new experiment exploiting the phonon-light technique using sodium iodide crystals with the scope to clarify the long-lasting dark matter claim of the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. This article reviews the principle of scintillating low-temperature calorimeters with emphasis on the benefits and challenges of this technique for direct dark matter searches in light of the current status and future developments.</description>

      <title>Precise synchronization of a free-running Rubidium atomic clock with GPS Time for applications in experimental particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of our study devoted to the development of a time correction algorithm needed to precisely synchronize a free-running Rubidium atomic clock with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This R&amp;D is performed in view of the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) experiment currently under construction in Japan, which requires a synchronization with UTC and between its different experimental sites with a precision better than $100$ ns. We use a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver to compare a PPS and a $10$ MHz signal, generated by a free-running Rubidium clock, to the Global Positioning System (GPS) Time signal. We use these comparisons to correct the time series (time stamps) provided by the Rubidium clock signal. We fit the difference between Rubidium and GPS Time with polynomial functions of time over a certain integration time window to extract a correction of the Rubidium time stamps in offline or online mode. In online mode, the latest fit results are used for the correction until a new comparison to GPS Time becomes available. We show that with an integration time window of around $10^4$ seconds, we can correct the time stamps drift, caused by the frequency random walk noise and the deterministic frequency drift of the free running Rubidium clock, so that the time difference with respect to GPS Time stays within a $\pm5$ ns range in both offline or online correction mode. Presented results could be of interest for other experiments in the field of neutrino physics and multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Inter-pixel cross-talk as background to two-photon interference effects in SPAD arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-talk is a well-known feature of single-photon avalanche detectors. It is especially important to account for this effect in applications involving coincidences of two or more photons registered by the sensor since in this case the cross-talk may mimic the useful signal. In this work, we characterize the cross-talk of the LinoSPAD2 detector, as well as perform joint measurements of the cross-talk and Hanbury Brown - Twiss two-photon interference, comparing and cross-calibrating both effects. With a median dark count rate of 125 cps/pixel, we report the average cross-talk probability of $0.22~\%$ for the nearest neighbor and also observe a long-range cross-talk of the order $2 \cdot 10^{-5}~\%$ for channels separated by up to 20 pixels.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Constraints from SuperCDMS HVeV Detectors Operated Underground with an Anticoincidence Event Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents constraints on dark-matter-electron interactions obtained from the first underground data-taking campaign with multiple SuperCDMS HVeV detectors operated in the same housing. An exposure of 7.63 g-days is used to set upper limits on the dark-matter-electron scattering cross section for dark matter masses between 0.5 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$, as well as upper limits on dark photon kinetic mixing and axion-like particle axioelectric coupling for masses between 1.2 and 23.3 eV/$c^2$. Compared to an earlier HVeV search, sensitivity was improved as a result of an increased overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent, an anticoincidence event selection, and better pile-up rejection. In the case of dark-matter-electron scattering via a heavy mediator, an improvement by up to a factor of 25 in cross-section sensitivity was achieved.</description>
