      <title>Estimating mixed memberships in multi-layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in multi-layer networks has emerged as a crucial area of modern network analysis. However, conventional approaches often assume that nodes belong exclusively to a single community, which fails to capture the complex structure of real-world networks where nodes may belong to multiple communities simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose novel spectral methods to estimate the common mixed memberships in the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. The proposed methods leverage the eigen-decomposition of three aggregate matrices: the sum of adjacency matrices, the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices, and the sum of squared adjacency matrices. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the consistency of our methods. Specifically, we derive per-node error rates under mild conditions on network sparsity, demonstrating their consistency as the number of nodes and/or layers increases under the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. Our theoretical results reveal that the method leveraging the sum of adjacency matrices generally performs poorer than the other two methods for mixed membership estimation in multi-layer networks. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to empirically validate our theoretical findings. For real-world multi-layer networks with unknown community information, we introduce two novel modularity metrics to quantify the quality of mixed membership community detection. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applications of our algorithms and modularity metrics by applying them to real-world multi-layer networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in extracting meaningful community structures.</description>

      <title>Model Selection with Model Zoo via Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained deep learning (DL) models are increasingly accessible in public repositories, i.e., model zoos. Given a new prediction task, finding the best model to fine-tune can be computationally intensive and costly, especially when the number of pre-trained models is large. Selecting the right pre-trained models is crucial, yet complicated by the diversity of models from various model families (like ResNet, Vit, Swin) and the hidden relationships between models and datasets. Existing methods, which utilize basic information from models and datasets to compute scores indicating model performance on target datasets, overlook the intrinsic relationships, limiting their effectiveness in model selection. In this study, we introduce TransferGraph, a novel framework that reformulates model selection as a graph learning problem. TransferGraph constructs a graph using extensive metadata extracted from models and datasets, while capturing their inherent relationships. Through comprehensive experiments across 16 real datasets, both images and texts, we demonstrate TransferGraph's effectiveness in capturing essential model-dataset relationships, yielding up to a 32% improvement in correlation between predicted performance and the actual fine-tuning results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Degree-corrected distribution-free model for community detection in weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10553v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A degree-corrected distribution-free model is proposed for weighted social networks with latent structural information. The model extends the previous distribution-free models by considering variation in node degree to fit real-world weighted networks, and it also extends the classical degree-corrected stochastic block model from un-weighted network to weighted network. We design an algorithm based on the idea of spectral clustering to fit the model. Theoretical framework on consistent estimation for the algorithm is developed under the model. Theoretical results when edge weights are generated from different distributions are analyzed. We also propose a general modularity as an extension of Newman's modularity from un-weighted network to weighted network. Using experiments with simulated and real-world networks, we show that our method significantly outperforms the uncorrected one, and the general modularity is effective.</description>

      <title>Mixed membership distribution-free model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04389v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of community detection in overlapping weighted networks, where nodes can belong to multiple communities and edge weights can be finite real numbers. To model such complex networks, we propose a general framework - the mixed membership distribution-free (MMDF) model. MMDF has no distribution constraints of edge weights and can be viewed as generalizations of some previous models, including the well-known mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. Especially, overlapping signed networks with latent community structures can also be generated from our model. We use an efficient spectral algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of convergence rate to estimate community memberships under the model. We also propose the fuzzy weighted modularity to evaluate the quality of community detection for overlapping weighted networks with positive and negative edge weights. We then provide a method to determine the number of communities for weighted networks by taking advantage of our fuzzy weighted modularity. Numerical simulations and real data applications are carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of our mixed membership distribution-free model and our fuzzy weighted modularity.</description>

      <title>Bipartite mixed membership distribution-free model. A novel model for community detection in overlapping bipartite weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling and estimating mixed memberships for overlapping unipartite un-weighted networks has been well studied in recent years. However, to our knowledge, there is no model for a more general case, the overlapping bipartite weighted networks. To close this gap, we introduce a novel model, the Bipartite Mixed Membership Distribution-Free (BiMMDF) model. Our model allows an adjacency matrix to follow any distribution as long as its expectation has a block structure related to node membership. In particular, BiMMDF can model overlapping bipartite signed networks and it is an extension of many previous models, including the popular mixed membership stochastic blcokmodels. An efficient algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of consistent estimation is applied to fit BiMMDF. We then obtain the separation conditions of BiMMDF for different distributions. Furthermore, we also consider missing edges for sparse networks. The advantage of BiMMDF is demonstrated in extensive synthetic networks and eight real-world networks.</description>

      <title>AClassiHonk: A System Framework to Annotate and Classify Vehicular Honk from Road Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies emphasize that vehicular honking contributes to over 50% of noise pollution in developing urban and suburban areas. Frequent honking negatively impacts health, road safety, and the environment. Recognizing and classifying different vehicle honks could offer valuable insights into environmental noise pollution. Existing research on outdoor sound classification and honk detection lacks the ability to classify honks based on vehicle types, limiting contextual information inference for locations, areas, or traffic. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design a system that can detect and classify honks of different types of vehicles from which we can infer some contextual information. In this paper, we have developed a novel framework AClassiHonk that performs raw vehicular honk sensing, data labeling and classifies the honk into three major groups, i.e., light-weight vehicles, medium-weight vehicles, and heavy-weight vehicles. We collected the raw audio samples of different vehicular honking based on spatio-temporal characteristics and converted them into spectrogram images. We have proposed a deep learning-based Multi-label Autoencoder model (MAE) for automated labeling of the unlabeled data samples, which provides 97.64% accuracy in contrast to existing deep learning-based data labeling methods. Further, we have used various pre-trained models, namely Inception V3, ResNet50, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and proposed an Ensembled Transfer Learning model (EnTL) for vehicle honks classification and performed comparative analysis. Results reveal that EnTL exhibits the best performance compared to pre-trained models and achieves 96.72% accuracy in our dataset. In addition, we have identified a context of a location based on these classified honk signatures in a city.</description>

      <title>The Great Ban: Efficacy and Unintended Consequences of a Massive Deplatforming Operation on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current landscape of online abuses and harms, effective content moderation is necessary to cultivate safe and inclusive online spaces. Yet, the effectiveness of many moderation interventions is still unclear. Here, we assess the effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive deplatforming operation that affected nearly 2,000 communities on Reddit. By analyzing 16M comments posted by 17K users during 14 months, we provide nuanced results on the effects, both desired and otherwise, of the ban. Among our main findings is that 15.6% of the affected users left Reddit and that those who remained reduced their toxicity by 6.6% on average. The ban also caused 5% users to increase their toxicity by more than 70% of their pre-ban level. Overall, our multifaceted results provide new insights into the efficacy of deplatforming. As such, our findings can inform the development of future moderation interventions and the policing of online platforms.</description>

      <title>Hyperedge Interaction-aware Hypergraph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs provide an effective modeling approach for modeling high-order relationships in many real-world datasets. To capture such complex relationships, several hypergraph neural networks have been proposed for learning hypergraph structure, which propagate information from nodes to hyperedges and then from hyperedges back to nodes. However, most existing methods focus on information propagation between hyperedges and nodes, neglecting the interactions among hyperedges themselves. In this paper, we propose HeIHNN, a hyperedge interaction-aware hypergraph neural network, which captures the interactions among hyperedges during the convolution process and introduce a novel mechanism to enhance information flow between hyperedges and nodes. Specifically, HeIHNN integrates the interactions between hyperedges into the hypergraph convolution by constructing a three-stage information propagation process. After propagating information from nodes to hyperedges, we introduce a hyperedge-level convolution to update the hyperedge embeddings. Finally, the embeddings that capture rich information from the interaction among hyperedges will be utilized to update the node embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a hyperedge outlier removal mechanism in the information propagation stages between nodes and hyperedges, which dynamically adjusts the hypergraph structure using the learned embeddings, effectively removing outliers. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show the competitive performance of HeIHNN compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>RAT: Retrieval-Augmented Transformer for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting click-through rates (CTR) is a fundamental task for Web applications, where a key issue is to devise effective models for feature interactions. Current methodologies predominantly concentrate on modeling feature interactions within an individual sample, while overlooking the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as a reference context to enhance the prediction. To make up for such deficiency, this paper develops a Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (RAT), aiming to acquire fine-grained feature interactions within and across samples. By retrieving similar samples, we construct augmented input for each target sample. We then build Transformer layers with cascaded attention to capture both intra- and cross-sample feature interactions, facilitating comprehensive reasoning for improved CTR prediction while retaining efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of RAT and suggest its advantage in long-tail scenarios. The code has been open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/YushenLi807/WWW24-RAT}.</description>

      <title>BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.</description>
