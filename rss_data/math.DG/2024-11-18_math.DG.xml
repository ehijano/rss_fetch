      <title>Einstein metrics on the full flag $F(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ M = G/K $ be a full flag manifold. In this work, we investigate the $ G$-stability of Einstein metrics on $M$ and analyze their stability types, including coindices, for several cases. We specifically focus on $F(n) = \mathrm{SU}(n)/T$, emphasizing $n = 5$, where we identify four new Einstein metrics in addition to known ones. Stability data, including coindex and Hessian spectrum, confirms that these metrics on $F(5)$ are pairwise non-homothetic, providing new insights into the finiteness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for complete maximal spacelike submanifolds in pseudo-hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the scalar curvature is a rigid invariant for complete maximal spacelike $p$-submanifolds in the pseudo-hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{p,q}$. We characterize the $p$-submanifolds achieving the bound and study the hyperbolicity of maximal $p$-submanifolds of $\mathbb{H}^{p,q}$. In codimension $q=1$, we deduce a rigidity result concerning the Ricci curvature of maximal hypersurfaces in anti-de Sitter spaces.</description>

      <title>Super-$\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ T-Duality and M-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super $L_\infty$-algebras unify extended super-symmetry with rational classifying spaces for higher flux densities: The super-invariant super-fluxes which control super $p$-branes and their supergravity target super-spaces are, together with their (non-linear) Bianchi identities, neatly encoded in (non-abelian) super-$L_\infty$ cocycles. These are the rational shadows of flux-quantization laws (in ordinary cohomology, K-theory, Cohomotopy, iterated K-theory, etc).
  We first review, in streamlined form while filling some previous gaps, double-dimensional reduction/oxidation and 10D superspace T-duality along higher-dimensional super-tori. We do so tangent super-space wise, by viewing it as an instance of adjunctions (dualities) between super-$L_\infty$-extensions and -cyclifications, applied to the avatar super-flux densities of 10D supergravity. In particular, this yields a derivation, at the rational level, of the traditional laws of "topological T-duality" from the super-$L_\infty$ structure of type II superspace. At this level, we also discuss a higher categorical analog of T-duality involving M-branes.
  Then, by considering super-space T-duality along all 1+9 spacetime dimensions while retaining the 11th dimension as in F-theory, we find the M-algebra appearing as the complete brane-charge extension of the fully T-doubled/correspondence super-spacetime. On this backdrop, we recognize the "decomposed" M-theory 3-form on the "hidden M-algebra" as an M-theoretic lift of the Poincar\'e super 2-form that controls superspace T-duality as the integral kernel of the super Fourier-Mukai transform. This provides the super-space structure of an M-theory lift of the doubled/correspondence space geometry, which controls T-duality.</description>

      <title>RETR: Multi-View Radar Detection Transformer for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.77+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of parabolic convex polytopes in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In odd dimensions, we prove a scalar curvature rigidity for parabolic convex polytopes in hyperbolic space enclosed by linear planes in the Poincare upper half-space model and convex with respect to the conformally related flat metric. Our method is based on spinor techniques and relies on the recent smoothing constructions of Brendle-Wang. We also prove a Llarull type rigidity for bounded smooth parabolic convex domains and a dihedral rigidity for polytopal initial data sets with dominant energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity and the higher mapping degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed connected oriented Riemannian manifold $N$ with non-vanishing Euler characteristic, non-negative curvature operator and $0&lt; 2\text{Ric}_N&lt;\text{scal}_N$ is area-rigid in the sense that any area non-increasing spin map $f\colon M\to N$ from a closed connected oriented Riemannian manifold $M$ with non-vanishing $\hat{A}$-degree and $\text{scal}_M\geq \text{scal}_N \circ f$ is a Riemannian submersion with $\text{scal}_M=\text{scal}_N \circ f$. This is due to Goette and Semmelmann and generalizes a result by Llarull. In this article, we show area-rigidity for not necessarily orientable manifolds with respect to a larger class of maps $f\colon M\to N$ by replacing the topological condition on the $\hat{A}$-degree by a less restrictive condition involving the so-called higher mapping degree. This includes fiber bundles over even dimensional spheres with enlargeable fibers, e.g. $\text{pr}_1\colon S^{2n}\times T^k \to S^{2n}$. We develop a technique to extract from a non-vanishing higher index a geometrically useful family of almost $\mathcal{D}$-harmonic sections. This also leads to a new proof of the fact that any closed connected spin manifold with non-negative scalar curvature and non-trivial Rosenberg index is Ricci flat.</description>

      <title>Toric vector bundles, non-abelianization, and spectral networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral networks and non-abelianization were introduced by Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke and they have many applications in mathematics and physics. In a recent work by Nho, he proved that the non-abelianization of an almost flat local system over the spectral curve of a meromorphic quadratic differential is the same as the family Floer construction. Based on the mirror symmetry philosophy, it is then natural to ask how holomorphic vector bundles arise from spectral networks and non-abelianization. In this paper, we construct toric vector bundles on complete toric surfaces via spectral networks and non-abelianization arising from Lagrangian multi-sections. As an application, we deduce that the moduli space of rank 2 toric vector bundles over toric surfaces admit an $A$-type $\mathcal{X}$-cluster structure.</description>

      <title>Curve shortening flow with an ambient force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the anisotropic curve shortening flow in the plane in the presence of an ambient force. We consider force fields in which all their derivatives are bounded in the $L^{\infty}$ sense. We prove that closed embedded curves that have a minimum of curvature sufficiently large shrink to round points. The method of proof follows along the same lines of Gage and Hamilton, in that we study a rescaling to prove curvature bounds. We additionally show that the influence of an ambient force field may make such a result untrue, by giving sufficient conditions on the ambient field that ensures eventual non-convexity of an initially convex curve evolving under the flow.</description>
