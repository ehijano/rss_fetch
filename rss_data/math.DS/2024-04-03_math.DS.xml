      <title>Periodic orbits near collision in a restricted four-body problem for the eight choreography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study orbits near collision in a non-autonomous restricted planar four-body problem. This restricted problem consists of a massless particle moving under the gravitational influence due to three bodies following the figure-eight choreography. We use regularized coordinates in order to deal numerically with motions near collision, and reversing symmetries to study both theoretically and numerically certain type of symmetric periodic orbits of the restricted system. The symmetric periodic orbits (initial conditions) were computed with the help of some boundary-value problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Markov surfaces: classification of stationary measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the four punctured sphere ${\mathbb{S}}_4^2$. Each choice of four traces, one for each puncture, determines a relative character variety for the representations of the fundamental group of  ${\mathbb{S}}_4^2$ in ${\sf{SL}}_2(\mathbb{C})$. We classify the stationary probability measures for the action of the mapping class group ${\sf{Mod}}({\mathbb{S}}_4^2)$ on these character varieties.</description>

      <title>Stability and Bifurcation Analysis of Two-Term Fractional Differential Equation with Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript deals with the stability and bifurcation analysis of the equation $D^{2\alpha}x(t)+c D^{\alpha}x(t)=a x(t)+b x(t-\tau)$, where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $\tau&gt;0$. We sketch the boundaries of various stability regions in the parameter plane under different conditions on $\alpha$ and $b$. First, we provide the stability analysis of this equation with $\tau=0$. Change in the stability of the delayed counterpart is possible only when the characteristic roots cross the imaginary axis. This leads to various delay-independent as well as delay-dependent stability results. The stability regions are bifurcated on the basis of the following behaviors with respect to the delay $\tau$ viz. stable region for all $\tau&gt;0$, unstable region, single stable region, stability switch, and instability switch.</description>

Abstract: In this article it is proved that an analytical planar vector field with a non-degenerate center at $(0,0)$ is analytically conjugate, in a neighborhood of $(0,0)$, to a Hamiltonian vector field of the form $y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-V'(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$, where $V$ is an analytic function defined in a neighborhood of the origin such that $V(0)=V'(0)=0$ and $V''(0)&gt;0.$</description>

      <title>On the stability of $\ddot x(t)+\alpha(t)\dot x(t)+\beta(t) x(t)=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main goal is to understand the stability of second order linear homogeneous differential equations $\ddot x(t)+\alpha(t)\dot x(t)+\beta(t)x(t)=0$ for $C^0$-generic values of the variable parameters $\alpha(t)$ and $\beta(t)$. For that we embed the problem into the framework of the general theory of continuous-time linear cocycles induced by the random ODE $\ddot x(t)+\alpha(\varphi^t(\omega))\dot x(t)+\beta(\varphi^t(\omega))x(t)=0$, where the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ evolve along the $\varphi^t$-orbit for $\omega\in M$, and $\varphi^t: M\to M$ is a flow defined on a compact Hausdorff space $M$ preserving a probability measure $\mu$. Considering $y=\dot x$, the above random ODE can be rewritten as $\dot X=A(\varphi^t (\omega))X$, with $X=(x,y)^\top$, having a kinetic linear cocycle as fundamental solution. 
  We prove that for a $C^0$-generic choice of parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and for $\mu$-almost all $\omega\in M$ either the Lyapunov exponents of the linear cocycle are equal ($\lambda_1(\omega)=\lambda_2(\omega)$), or else the orbit of $\omega$ displays a dominated splitting. Applying to dissipative systems ($\alpha&lt;0$) we obtain a dichotomy: either $\lambda_1(\omega)=\lambda_2(\omega)&lt;0$, attesting the stability of the solution of the random ODE above, or else the orbit of $\omega$ displays a dominated splitting. Applying to frictionless systems ($\alpha=0$) we obtain a dichotomy: either $\lambda_1(\omega)=\lambda_2(\omega)=0$, attesting the asymptotic neutrality of the solution of the random ODE above, or else the orbit of $\omega$ displays a hyperbolic splitting attesting the \emph{uniform} instability of the solution of the ODE above. This last result implies also an analog result for the 1-d continuous aperiodic Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, all results hold for $L^\infty$-generic parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Bose-Hubbard model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

      <title>Performance triggered adaptive model reduction for soil moisture estimation in precision irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate soil moisture information is crucial for developing precise irrigation control strategies to enhance water use efficiency. Soil moisture estimation based on limited soil moisture sensors is crucial for obtaining comprehensive soil moisture information when dealing with large-scale agricultural fields. The major challenge in soil moisture estimation lies in the high dimensionality of the spatially discretized agro-hydrological models. In this work, we propose a performance-triggered adaptive model reduction approach to address this challenge. The pro- posed approach employs a trajectory-based unsupervised machine learning technique, and a prediction performance-based triggering scheme is designed to govern model updates adaptively in a way such that the prediction error between the reduced model and the original model over a prediction horizon is maintained below a predetermined threshold. An adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed based on the reduced model for soil moisture estimation. The applicability and performance of the proposed approach are evaluated extensively through the application to a simulated large-scale agricultural field.</description>

      <title>Minimal model program for algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the contraction theorem and the existence of flips for algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties which strengthen a result of Cascini and Spicer by removing the assumption on termination of flips. Thus we establish the minimal model program for algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties unconditionally.
  As a consequence, for algebraically integrable foliations polarized with ample divisors, we prove the existence of minimal models and Mori fiber spaces either when the ambient variety is klt or in the sense of Birkar-Shokurov. We also show the existence of a Shokurov-type polytope for algebraically integrable foliations.</description>

      <title>A novel analysis method for calculating nonlinear Frequency Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) are the most widely used functions to characterise the dynamic behaviour of structures. The natural frequencies and damping behaviour can be easily and quickly detected from a Bode diagram. The modal properties of FRFs can be evaluated using modal analysis methods, and as the last step, frequency response models can synthesise response functions to verify the robustness of the modal parameters identified by the analysis. The circularity between 1) measurement, 2) identification, 3) regeneration and 4) comparison is ensured on the assumption that transfer functions are measured under linear vibrations, even though mechanical systems are intrinsically non-linear. Some sources of nonlinearity might be excited and revealed, and others not for various reasons. Anyhow, it is unavoidable to measure non-linear vibrations when vibration tests are executed at various levels of excitation forces. Eventually, linear and non-linear vibrations are processed to obtain linear and non-linear FRFs. The linear FRFs are processed using the existing identification methods. The non-linear FRFs are archived or blandly processed to evaluate the level and the type of nonlinearity, such as hardening or softening behaviour. This research aims to (i) formulate a new analysis method to generate nonlinear frequency responses and (ii) formulate a new identification method for extracting amplitude-dependent modal parameters. The first objective will demonstrate that a nonlinear frequency response surface generated by linear FRFs is the solution space of nonlinear FRFs. The second objective will demonstrate that a linear modal analysis method called line-fit, based on the Dobson formulation, allows extracting amplitude-dependent modal parameters from non-linear FRFs.</description>

Abstract: We construct so-called Darboux transformations and solutions of the dynamical Hamiltonian systems with several space variables $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=\sum_{k=1}^r H_k(t)\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \zeta_k}\,$ $( H_k(t)= H_k(t)^*)$. In particular, such systems are analogs of the port-Hamiltonian systems in the important and insufficiently studied case of several space variables. The corresponding energy relations are written down. The method is illustrated by several examples, where explicit solutions are given.</description>

      <title>Invariants and reversibility in polynomial systems of ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a relationship between invariants of certain group actions and the time-reversibility of two-dimensional polynomial differential systems exhibiting a $1:-1$ resonant singularity at the origin. We focus on the connection of time-reversibility with the Sibirsky subvariety of the center (integrability) variety, which encompasses systems possessing a local analytic first integral near the origin. An algorithm for generating the Sibirsky ideal for these systems is proposed and the algebraic properties of the ideal are examined.
  Furthermore, using a generalization of the concept of time-reversibility we study $n$-dimensional systems with a $1:\zeta:\zeta^2:\dots:\zeta^{n-1}$ resonant singularity at the origin, where $n$ is prime and $\zeta$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity. We study the invariants of a Lie group action on the parameter space of the system, leveraging the theory of binomial ideals as a fundamental tool for the analysis. Our study reveals intriguing connections between generalized reversibility, invariants, and binomial ideals, shedding light on their complex interrelations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12837v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A holomorphic pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\ell\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ of co-degree $1$ and degree $d$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the data of a line $\ell$ of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P }^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ of degree $d-1.$ We study pre-foliations of co-degree $1$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{ C}}$ with a flat Legendre transform (dual web). After having established some general results on the flatness of the dual $d$-web of a homogeneous pre-foliation of co-degree $1$ and degree $d$, we describe some explicit examples and we show that up to automorphism of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ there are two families and six examples of homogeneous pre-foliations of co-degree $1$ and degree $3$ on $\mathbb {P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ with a flat dual web. This allows us to prove an analogue for pre-foliations of co-degree $1$ and degree~$3$ of a result, obtained in collaboration with D. Mar\'{\i}n, on foliations of degree $3$ with non-degenerate singularities and a flat Legendre transform. We also show that the dual web of a reduced convex pre-foliation of co-degree $1$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is flat. This is an analogue of a result on foliations of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ due to D. Mar\'{\i}n and J. V. Pereira.</description>

Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to obtain Berry--Esseen type error bounds in the multivariate central limit theorem for non-stationary processes generated by time-dependent compositions of uniformly expanding dynamical systems. In a particular case of random dynamical systems with a strongly mixing base transformation, we derive an error estimate of order $O(N^{-1/2})$ in the quenched multivariate CLT, provided that the covariance matrix "grows linearly" with the number of summands $N$. The error in the normal approximation is estimated for the class of all convex sets.</description>

Abstract: The symplectic spectral metric on the set of Lagrangian submanifolds or Hamiltonian maps can be used to define a completion of these spaces. For an element of such a completion, we define its $\gamma$-support. We also define the notion of $\gamma$-coisotropic set, and prove that a $\gamma$-support must be $\gamma$-coisotropic toghether with many properties of the $\gamma$-support and $\gamma$-coisotropic sets. We give examples of Lagrangians in the completion having large $\gamma$-support and we study those (called "regular Lagrangians") having small $\gamma$-support. We compare the notion of $\gamma$-coisotropy with other notions of isotropy.</description>

      <title>CP-PINNs: Data-Driven Changepoints Detection in PDEs Using Online Optimized Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in scenarios where the parameters of the given PDE dynamics may exhibit changepoints at random time. We employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) - universal approximators capable of estimating the solution of any physical law described by a system of PDEs, which serves as a regularization during neural network training, restricting the space of admissible solutions and enhancing function approximation accuracy. We demonstrate that when the system exhibits sudden changes in the PDE dynamics, this regularization is either insufficient to accurately estimate the true dynamics, or it may result in model miscalibration and failure. Consequently, we propose a PINNs extension using a Total-Variation penalty, which allows to accommodate multiple changepoints in the PDE dynamics and significantly improves function approximation. These changepoints can occur at random locations over time and are estimated concurrently with the solutions. Additionally, we introduce an online learning method for re-weighting loss function terms dynamically. Through empirical analysis using examples of various equations with parameter changes, we showcase the advantages of our proposed model. In the absence of changepoints, the model reverts to the original PINNs model. However, when changepoints are present, our approach yields superior parameter estimation, improved model fitting, and reduced training error compared to the original PINNs model.</description>

We prove asymptotic formulas $\lambda (T^{-n}I) =\mu(I)(\vert I_0 \vert +O(q^n))$ for such transformations $T$, where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R$, $\mu$ the normalized $T$-invariant Lebesgue absolutely continuous measure, $I$ subinterval in $I_0$, and $q=0.288$ is smaller than the Wirsing constant $q_W=0.3036\ldots$</description>

Abstract: The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of research, where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while simultaneously avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our previously developed theory for distributed collaborative safety-critical control for networked dynamic systems, we propose a distributed algorithm for the formation control of robot swarms given individual agent dynamics, induced formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and velocity information within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety guarantees for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors to restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety conditions derived from high-order control barrier functions. We provide conditions under which a swarm is guaranteed to achieve collective safety with respect to multiple obstacles using a modified collaborative safety algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our distributed algorithm via simulation in a simplified physics-based environment.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves (solitons) in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of a stable soliton in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>
