      <title>Generalizing the Eigenvalue Interlacing Theorem to Pseudo-Similarity Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current general form of the well-known Eigenvalue Interlacing Theorem states that, given an $N \times N$ Hermitian matrix $P$, the eigenvalues of the matrix product $Q^{H} P Q$ will interlace those of $P$ if the columns of the $N \times L$ matrix $Q$ (with $L \le N$) are unitary. This note further generalizes this theorem to include pseudo-similarity transformations, namely products of the form $H^{\dagger} P H$, where $H$ is a general $N \times K$ matrix and "$\dagger$" denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This implies that, while the product $Q^{H} P Q$ is Hermitian and is generally a deflated version of $P$ (both in dimensionality and in the number of non-zero eigenvalues), this is not the case for $H^{\dagger} P H$, which, although generally a deflated version of $P$ in terms of the number of non-zero eigenvalues, will not necessarily be so in dimensionality, nor will it in general be Hermitian. Thus, this note not only generalizes the Eigenvalue Interlacing Theorem but also shows that eigenvalue interlacing may occur between Hermitian and non-Hermitian matrices and even in the presence of dimensionally inflated matrices.</description>

      <title>Efimov effect in the Born-Oppenheimer picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Efimov effect in a mass-imbalanced system consisting of two heavy particles and one light particle within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The result obtained in R. Figari, H. Saberbaghi, and A. Teta, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57(5), 2024, for zero angular momentum is recovered here as a special case, and the analysis is extended to all angular momenta. In this setting, the resonant heavy-light interactions are modeled as point interactions, under the assumption of either exchange symmetry or antisymmetry with respect to the positions of the delta centers. Within this framework, we prove that in the unitary limit the Efimov spectrum depends solely on the mass ratio and particle statistics; that is, the so-called three-body parameter is absent. We also provide a condition ensuring that the spectrum contains no nonEfimov eigenvalues. Furthermore, we study the system away from the unitary limit and show that the spatial size of the weakest bound state near the threshold is approximately 2.8 times the two-body scattering length, in contrast to the common assumption that these two scales coincide. Finally, we compute Bargmann bound for the number of bound states and obtain a sharper estimate than the results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Angular Graph Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.</description>

      <title>Congruence counting in Schottky and continued fractions semigroups of $\operatorname{SO}(n, 1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the two settings we are concerned with are $\Gamma &lt; \operatorname{SO}(n, 1)$ a Zariski dense Schottky semigroup and $\Gamma &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ a Zariski dense continued fractions semigroup. In both settings, we prove a uniform asymptotic counting formula for the associated congruence subsemigroups, generalizing the work of Magee-Oh-Winter [arXiv:1601.03705] in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ to higher dimensions. Superficially, the proof requires two separate strategies: the expander machinery of Golsefidy-Varj\'u, based on the work of Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak, and Dolgopyat's method. However, there are several challenges in higher dimensions. Firstly, using the expander machinery requires a key input: the Zariski density and full trace field property of the return trajectory subgroups, newly introduced in [arXiv:2006.07787]. Secondly, we need to adapt Stoyanov's version of Dolgopyat's method to circumvent some technical issues while the main difficulty is to prove the key inputs: the local non-integrability condition (LNIC) and the non-concentration property (NCP).</description>
