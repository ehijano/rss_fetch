      <title>Algorithmic Drift: A Simulation Framework to Study the Effects of Recommender Systems on User Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital platforms such as social media and e-commerce websites adopt Recommender Systems to provide value to the user. However, the social consequences deriving from their adoption are still unclear. Many scholars argue that recommenders may lead to detrimental effects, such as bias-amplification deriving from the feedback loop between algorithmic suggestions and users' choices. Nonetheless, the extent to which recommenders influence changes in users leaning remains uncertain. In this context, it is important to provide a controlled environment for evaluating the recommendation algorithm before deployment. To address this, we propose a stochastic simulation framework that mimics user-recommender system interactions in a long-term scenario. In particular, we simulate the user choices by formalizing a user model, which comprises behavioral aspects, such as the user resistance towards the recommendation algorithm and their inertia in relying on the received suggestions. Additionally, we introduce two novel metrics for quantifying the algorithm's impact on user preferences, specifically in terms of drift over time. We conduct an extensive evaluation on multiple synthetic datasets, aiming at testing the robustness of our framework when considering different scenarios and hyper-parameters setting. The experimental results prove that the proposed methodology is effective in detecting and quantifying the drift over the users preferences by means of the simulation. All the code and data used to perform the experiments are publicly available.</description>

      <title>FusionANNS: An Efficient CPU/GPU Cooperative Processing Architecture for Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has emerged as a crucial component of database and AI infrastructure. Ever-increasing vector datasets pose significant challenges in terms of performance, cost, and accuracy for ANNS services. None of modern ANNS systems can address these issues simultaneously. We present FusionANNS, a high-throughput, low-latency, cost-efficient, and high-accuracy ANNS system for billion-scale datasets using SSDs and only one entry-level GPU. The key idea of FusionANNS lies in CPU/GPU collaborative filtering and re-ranking mechanisms, which significantly reduce I/O operations across CPUs, GPU, and SSDs to break through the I/O performance bottleneck. Specifically, we propose three novel designs: (1) multi-tiered indexing to avoid data swapping between CPUs and GPU, (2) heuristic re-ranking to eliminate unnecessary I/Os and computations while guaranteeing high accuracy, and (3) redundant-aware I/O deduplication to further improve I/O efficiency. We implement FusionANNS and compare it with the state-of-the-art SSD-based ANNS system--SPANN and GPU-accelerated in-memory ANNS system--RUMMY. Experimental results show that FusionANNS achieves 1) 9.4-13.1X higher query per second (QPS) and 5.7-8.8X higher cost efficiency compared with SPANN; 2) and 2-4.9X higher QPS and 2.3-6.8X higher cost efficiency compared with RUMMY, while guaranteeing low latency and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Generative Pre-trained Ranking Model with Over-parameterization at Web-Scale (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to rank (LTR) is widely employed in web searches to prioritize pertinent webpages from retrieved content based on input queries. However, traditional LTR models encounter two principal obstacles that lead to suboptimal performance: (1) the lack of well-annotated query-webpage pairs with ranking scores covering a diverse range of search query popularities, which hampers their ability to address queries across the popularity spectrum, and (2) inadequately trained models that fail to induce generalized representations for LTR, resulting in overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose a \emph{\uline{G}enerative \uline{S}emi-\uline{S}upervised \uline{P}re-trained} (GS2P) LTR model. We conduct extensive offline experiments on both a publicly available dataset and a real-world dataset collected from a large-scale search engine. Furthermore, we deploy GS2P in a large-scale web search engine with realistic traffic, where we observe significant improvements in the real-world application.</description>

      <title>Train Once, Deploy Anywhere: Matryoshka Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in language and vision modeling, integrating rich multimodal knowledge into recommender systems continues to pose significant challenges. This is primarily due to the need for efficient recommendation, which requires adaptive and interactive responses. In this study, we focus on sequential recommendation and introduce a lightweight framework called full-scale Matryoshka representation learning for multimodal recommendation (fMRLRec). Our fMRLRec captures item features at different granularities, learning informative representations for efficient recommendation across multiple dimensions. To integrate item features from diverse modalities, fMRLRec employs a simple mapping to project multimodal item features into an aligned feature space. Additionally, we design an efficient linear transformation that embeds smaller features into larger ones, substantially reducing memory requirements for large-scale training on recommendation data. Combined with improved state space modeling techniques, fMRLRec scales to different dimensions and only requires one-time training to produce multiple models tailored to various granularities. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of fMRLRec on multiple benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Recommender Systems (RS) have witnessed a transformative shift with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Models such as GPT-3.5/4, Llama, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The extensive information pre-trained by these LLMs allows for the potential to capture a more profound semantic representation from different contextual information of users and items.
  While the great potential lies behind the thriving of LLMs, the challenge of leveraging user-item preferences from contextual information and its alignment with the improvement of Recommender Systems needs to be addressed. Believing that a better understanding of the user or item itself can be the key factor in improving recommendation performance, we conduct research on generating informative profiles using state-of-the-art LLMs.
  To boost the linguistic abilities of LLMs in Recommender Systems, we introduce the Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation (P4R). In our P4R framework, we utilize the LLM prompting strategy to create personalized item profiles. These profiles are then transformed into semantic representation spaces using a pre-trained BERT model for text embedding. Furthermore, we incorporate a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for collaborative filtering representation. The P4R framework aligns these two embedding spaces in order to address the general recommendation tasks. In our evaluation, we compare P4R with state-of-the-art Recommender models and assess the quality of prompt-based profile generation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automatic Keyphrase Labelling with Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) Architecture: A Framework for Keyphrase Generation and Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic keyphrase labelling stands for the ability of models to retrieve words or short phrases that adequately describe documents' content. Previous work has put much effort into exploring extractive techniques to address this task; however, these methods cannot produce keyphrases not found in the text. Given this limitation, keyphrase generation approaches have arisen lately. This paper presents a keyphrase generation model based on the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. Having a document's title and abstract as input, we learn a T5 model to generate keyphrases which adequately define its content. We name this model docT5keywords. We not only perform the classic inference approach, where the output sequence is directly selected as the predicted values, but we also report results from a majority voting approach. In this approach, multiple sequences are generated, and the keyphrases are ranked based on their frequency of occurrence across these sequences. Along with this model, we present a novel keyphrase filtering technique based on the T5 architecture. We train a T5 model to learn whether a given keyphrase is relevant to a document. We devise two evaluation methodologies to prove our model's capability to filter inadequate keyphrases. First, we perform a binary evaluation where our model has to predict if a keyphrase is relevant for a given document. Second, we filter the predicted keyphrases by several AKG models and check if the evaluation scores are improved. Experimental results demonstrate that our keyphrase generation model significantly outperforms all the baselines, with gains exceeding 100\% in some cases. The proposed filtering technique also achieves near-perfect accuracy in eliminating false positives across all datasets.</description>

      <title>Modern Hopfield Networks meet Encoded Neural Representations -- Addressing Practical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Graphformer-based Ranking at Web-scale Search (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both Transformer and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed in the domain of learning to rank (LTR). However, these approaches adhere to two distinct yet complementary problem formulations: ranking score regression based on query-webpage pairs, and link prediction within query-webpage bipartite graphs, respectively. While it is possible to pre-train GNNs or Transformers on source datasets and subsequently fine-tune them on sparsely annotated LTR datasets, the distributional shifts between the pair-based and bipartite graph domains present significant challenges in integrating these heterogeneous models into a unified LTR framework at web scale. To address this, we introduce the novel MPGraf model, which leverages a modular and capsule-based pre-training strategy, aiming to cohesively integrate the regression capabilities of Transformers with the link prediction strengths of GNNs. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments to rigorously evaluate the performance of MPGraf.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Enhancing Large Language Models for Novelty Assessment in Scholarly Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have evaluated the creativity/novelty of large language models (LLMs) primarily from a semantic perspective, using benchmarks from cognitive science. However, accessing the novelty in scholarly publications is a largely unexplored area in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a scholarly novelty benchmark (SchNovel) to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess novelty in scholarly papers. SchNovel consists of 15000 pairs of papers across six fields sampled from the arXiv dataset with publication dates spanning 2 to 10 years apart. In each pair, the more recently published paper is assumed to be more novel. Additionally, we propose RAG-Novelty, which simulates the review process taken by human reviewers by leveraging the retrieval of similar papers to assess novelty. Extensive experiments provide insights into the capabilities of different LLMs to assess novelty and demonstrate that RAG-Novelty outperforms recent baseline models.</description>

      <title>PIFS-Rec: Process-In-Fabric-Switch for Large-Scale Recommendation System Inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have become increasingly popular and prevalent in today's datacenters, consuming most of the AI inference cycles. The performance of DLRMs is heavily influenced by available bandwidth due to their large vector sizes in embedding tables and concurrent accesses. To achieve substantial improvements over existing solutions, novel approaches towards DLRM optimization are needed, especially, in the context of emerging interconnect technologies like CXL. This study delves into exploring CXL-enabled systems, implementing a process-in-fabric-switch (PIFS) solution to accelerate DLRMs while optimizing their memory and bandwidth scalability. We present an in-depth characterization of industry-scale DLRM workloads running on CXL-ready systems, identifying the predominant bottlenecks in existing CXL systems. We, therefore, propose PIFS-Rec, a PIFS-based scheme that implements near-data processing through downstream ports of the fabric switch. PIFS-Rec achieves a latency that is 3.89x lower than Pond, an industry-standard CXL-based system, and also outperforms BEACON, a state-of-the-art scheme, by 2.03x.</description>

      <title>Spacewalker: Traversing Representation Spaces for Fast Interactive Exploration and Annotation of Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured data in industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing presents significant challenges for efficient analysis and decision making. Detecting patterns within this data and understanding their impact is critical but complex without the right tools. Traditionally, these tasks relied on the expertise of data analysts or labor-intensive manual reviews. In response, we introduce Spacewalker, an interactive tool designed to explore and annotate data across multiple modalities. Spacewalker allows users to extract data representations and visualize them in low-dimensional spaces, enabling the detection of semantic similarities. Through extensive user studies, we assess Spacewalker's effectiveness in data annotation and integrity verification. Results show that the tool's ability to traverse latent spaces and perform multi-modal queries significantly enhances the user's capacity to quickly identify relevant data. Moreover, Spacewalker allows for annotation speed-ups far superior to conventional methods, making it a promising tool for efficiently navigating unstructured data and improving decision making processes. The code of this work is open-source and can be found at: https://github.com/code-lukas/Spacewalker</description>

      <title>A Personality-Guided Preference Aggregator for Ephemeral Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ephemeral group recommendation (EGR) aims to suggest items for a group of users who come together for the first time. Existing work typically consider individual preferences as the sole factor in aggregating group preferences. However, they neglect to take into account the importance of the individual inherent factors, such as personality, and thus fail to accurately simulate the group decision-making process. Additionally, these methods often struggle due to insufficient interactive records. To tackle these issues, a Personality-Guided Preference Aggregator (PEGA) is proposed, which guides the preference aggregation of group members based on their personalities, rather than relying solely on their preferences. Specifically, implicit personalities are first extracted from user reviews. Hyper-rectangles are then used to aggregate individual personalities to obtain the "Group Personality", which allows for the learning of personality distributions within the group. Subsequently, a personality attention mechanism is employed to aggregate group preferences, and a preference-based fine-tuning module is used to balance the weights of personality and preferences. The role of personality in this approach is twofold: (1) To estimate the importance of individual users in a group and provide explainability; (2) To alleviate the data sparsity issue encountered in ephemeral groups. Experimental results demonstrate that, on four real-world datasets, the PEGA model significantly outperforms related baseline models in terms of classification accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, empirical evidence supports the idea that personality plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of EGR tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding-based neural retrieval is a prevalent approach to address the semantic gap problem which often arises in product search on tail queries. In contrast, popular queries typically lack context and have a broad intent where additional context from users historical interaction can be helpful. In this paper, we share our novel approach to address both: the semantic gap problem followed by an end to end trained model for personalized semantic retrieval. We propose learning a unified embedding model incorporating graph, transformer and term-based embeddings end to end and share our design choices for optimal tradeoff between performance and efficiency. We share our learnings in feature engineering, hard negative sampling strategy, and application of transformer model, including a novel pre-training strategy and other tricks for improving search relevance and deploying such a model at industry scale. Our personalized retrieval model significantly improves the overall search experience, as measured by a 5.58% increase in search purchase rate and a 2.63% increase in site-wide conversion rate, aggregated across multiple A/B tests - on live traffic.</description>

However, concerns have arisen as LLMs will exhibit discriminatory ranking behaviors based on users' sensitive attributes (\eg gender). Worse still, in this paper, we identify a subtler form of discrimination in LLMs, termed \textit{implicit ranking unfairness}, where LLMs exhibit discriminatory ranking patterns based solely on non-sensitive user profiles, such as user names. Such implicit unfairness is more widespread but less noticeable, threatening the ethical foundation. To comprehensively explore such unfairness, our analysis will focus on three research aspects: (1) We propose an evaluation method to investigate the severity of implicit ranking unfairness. (2) We uncover the reasons for causing such unfairness. (3) To mitigate such unfairness effectively, we utilize a pair-wise regression method to conduct fair-aware data augmentation for LLM fine-tuning. The experiment demonstrates that our method outperforms existing approaches in ranking fairness, achieving this with only a small reduction in accuracy. Lastly, we emphasize the need for the community to identify and mitigate the implicit unfairness, aiming to avert the potential deterioration in the reinforced human-LLMs ecosystem deterioration.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Reranking: A Simple yet Effective Abstention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12997v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) has significantly improved upon heuristic-based Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Yet, failures remain frequent, the models used often being unable to retrieve documents relevant to the user's query. We address this challenge by proposing a lightweight abstention mechanism tailored for real-world constraints, with particular emphasis placed on the reranking phase. We introduce a protocol for evaluating abstention strategies in black-box scenarios (typically encountered when relying on API services), demonstrating their efficacy, and propose a simple yet effective data-driven mechanism. We provide open-source code for experiment replication and abstention implementation, fostering wider adoption and application in diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>ChatDiet: Empowering Personalized Nutrition-Oriented Food Recommender Chatbots through an LLM-Augmented Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The profound impact of food on health necessitates advanced nutrition-oriented food recommendation services. Conventional methods often lack the crucial elements of personalization, explainability, and interactivity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) bring interpretability and explainability, their standalone use falls short of achieving true personalization. In this paper, we introduce ChatDiet, a novel LLM-powered framework designed specifically for personalized nutrition-oriented food recommendation chatbots. ChatDiet integrates personal and population models, complemented by an orchestrator, to seamlessly retrieve and process pertinent information. The personal model leverages causal discovery and inference techniques to assess personalized nutritional effects for a specific user, whereas the population model provides generalized information on food nutritional content. The orchestrator retrieves, synergizes and delivers the output of both models to the LLM, providing tailored food recommendations designed to support targeted health outcomes. The result is a dynamic delivery of personalized and explainable food recommendations, tailored to individual user preferences. Our evaluation of ChatDiet includes a compelling case study, where we establish a causal personal model to estimate individual nutrition effects. Our assessments, including a food recommendation test showcasing a 92\% effectiveness rate, coupled with illustrative dialogue examples, underscore ChatDiet's strengths in explainability, personalization, and interactivity.</description>

      <title>Robust Interaction-Based Relevance Modeling for Online e-Commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic relevance calculation is crucial for e-commerce search engines, as it ensures that the items selected closely align with customer intent. Inadequate attention to this aspect can detrimentally affect user experience and engagement. Traditional text-matching techniques are prevalent but often fail to capture the nuances of search intent accurately, so neural networks now have become a preferred solution to processing such complex text matching. Existing methods predominantly employ representation-based architectures, which strike a balance between high traffic capacity and low latency. However, they exhibit significant shortcomings in generalization and robustness when compared to interaction-based architectures. In this work, we introduce a robust interaction-based modeling paradigm to address these shortcomings. It encompasses 1) a dynamic length representation scheme for expedited inference, 2) a professional terms recognition method to identify subjects and core attributes from complex sentence structures, and 3) a contrastive adversarial training protocol to bolster the model's robustness and matching capabilities. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate the superior robustness and effectiveness of our approach, and online A/B testing confirms its ability to improve relevance in the same exposure position, resulting in more clicks and conversions. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first interaction-based approach for large e-commerce search relevance calculation. Notably, we have deployed it for the entire search traffic on alibaba.com, the largest B2B e-commerce platform in the world.</description>

      <title>DemoRank: Selecting Effective Demonstrations for Large Language Models in Ranking Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) as zero-shot passage rankers. However, few studies have explored how to select appropriate in-context demonstrations for the passage ranking task, which is the focus of this paper. Previous studies mainly use LLM's feedback to train a retriever for demonstration selection. These studies apply the LLM to score each demonstration independently, which ignores the dependencies between demonstrations (especially important in ranking task), leading to inferior performance of top-$k$ retrieved demonstrations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a demonstration reranker to rerank the retrieved demonstrations so that top-$k$ ranked ones are more suitable for ICL. However, generating training data for such reranker is quite challenging. On the one hand, different from demonstration retriever, the training samples of reranker need to incorporate demonstration dependencies. On the other hand, obtaining the gold ranking from the retrieved demonstrations is an NP-hard problem, which is hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method to approximate the optimal demonstration list iteratively and utilize LLM to score demonstration lists of varying lengths. By doing so, the search space is greatly reduced and demonstration dependencies are considered. Based on these scored demonstration lists, we further design a list-pairwise training approach which compares a pair of lists that only differ in the last demonstration, to teach the reranker how to select the next demonstration given a previous sequence. In this paper, we propose a demonstration selection framework DemoRank for ranking task and conduct extensive experiments to prove its strong ability.</description>

      <title>WebQuest: A Benchmark for Multimodal QA on Web Page Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of powerful multimodal LLMs has enhanced the viability of building web agents which can, with increasing levels of autonomy, assist users to retrieve information and complete tasks on various human-computer interfaces. It is hence necessary to build challenging benchmarks that span a wide-variety of use cases reflecting real-world usage. In this work, we present WebQuest, a multi-page question-answering dataset that requires reasoning across multiple related web pages. In contrast to existing UI benchmarks that focus on multi-step web navigation and task completion, our dataset evaluates information extraction, multimodal retrieval and composition of information from many web pages. WebQuest includes three question categories: single-screen QA, multi-screen QA, and QA based on navigation traces. We evaluate leading proprietary multimodal models like GPT-4V, Gemini Flash, Claude 3, and open source models like InstructBLIP, PaliGemma on our dataset, revealing a significant gap between single-screen and multi-screen reasoning. Finally, we investigate inference time techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve model capabilities on multi-screen reasoning.</description>

      <title>Object-Aware Query Perturbation for Cross-Modal Image-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pre-trained vision and language (V\&amp;L) models have substantially improved the performance of cross-modal image-text retrieval. In general, however, V\&amp;L models have limited retrieval performance for small objects because of the rough alignment between words and the small objects in the image. In contrast, it is known that human cognition is object-centric, and we pay more attention to important objects, even if they are small. To bridge this gap between the human cognition and the V\&amp;L model's capability, we propose a cross-modal image-text retrieval framework based on ``object-aware query perturbation.'' The proposed method generates a key feature subspace of the detected objects and perturbs the corresponding queries using this subspace to improve the object awareness in the image. In our proposed method, object-aware cross-modal image-text retrieval is possible while keeping the rich expressive power and retrieval performance of existing V\&amp;L models without additional fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show that our method outperforms conventional algorithms. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/NEC-N-SOGI/query-perturbation}.</description>

      <title>Towards a Realistic Long-Term Benchmark for Open-Web Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate agents on real-world "messy" open-web research tasks of the type that are routine in finance and consulting. In doing so, we lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. We built and tested several agent architectures with o1-preview, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations. Our evaluation represents the first in-depth assessment of agents' abilities to conduct challenging, economically valuable analyst-style research on the real open web.</description>
