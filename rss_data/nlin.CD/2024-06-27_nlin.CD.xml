      <title>Temporal Dynamics beyond the Exceptional Point in the Ikeda Map with Balanced Gain and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal dynamics of the Ikeda Map with Balanced Gain and Loss and in the presence of feedback loops with saturation nonlinearity. From the bifurcation analysis, we find that the temporal evolution of optical power undergoes period quadrupling at the exceptional point (EP) of the system and beyond that, chaotic dynamics emerge in the system and this has been further corroborated from the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) of the model. For a closer inspection, we analyzed the parameter basin of the system, which further leads to our inference that the Ikeda Map with Balanced Gain and Loss exhibits the emergence of chaotic dynamics beyond the exceptional point (EP). Furthermore, we find that the temporal dynamics beyond the EP regime leads to the onset of Extreme Events (EE) in this system via attractor merging crisis.</description>

      <title>Effects of local mutations in quadratic iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce mutations in replication systems in which the intact copying mechanism is performed by discrete iterations of a complex quadratic map in the family $f_c(z) = z^2+c$. More specifically, we consider a "correct" function $f_{c_1}$ acting on the complex plane (representing the RNA to be copied). A "mutation" $f_{c_0}$ is a different ("erroneous") map acting on a locus of given radius $r$ around a mutation focal point $\xi^*$. The effect of the mutation is interpolated radially to eventually recover the original map $f_{c_1}$ when reaching an outer radius $R$. We call the resulting map a "mutated" map.
  In the theoretical framework of mutated iterations, we study how a mutation (replication error) affects the temporal evolution of the system, in the context of cellular differentiation. We use the prisoner set of the system to quantify simultaneously the long-term behavior of the entire space under mutated maps. We analyze how the position, timing and size of the mutation can alter the system's long-term evolution (as encoded in the topology of its prisoner set). In the context of genetics, this framework may increase our understanding of the factors and mechanisms that shape the genetic expression, in a specialized cell, in the process of differentiation from a stem cell.</description>

      <title>Chaotic interactions between dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06614v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider dark matter and dark energy as grand-canonical systems which are open, non-equilibrium coupled, and interacting systems. For the first time, we propose a new more realistic interaction scheme to explain dynamics between coupled interacting thermodynamic systems. Based on this new interaction schema, we propose new theorems to define the interactions including mutual and self-interactions. We proved the theorems based on the energy conservation law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we obtain new coupled equations using the theorems. We numerically solved the interaction equations and obtained phase space diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. We show that the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is chaotic. We conclude that these theorems and results can be generalized to all coupled interacting particle and thermodynamic systems. Finally, we evaluated that the obtained results indicate the existence of a new law in physics. Additionally, based on the results, we gave physical definitions of basic concepts such as chaos and self-organization and pointed out the existence of hidden symmetries and variables in interacting systems.</description>
