      <title>Hot-spots around Sagittarius A*: Joint fits to astrometry and polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) in near-infrared (NIR) show irregular flaring activity. Flares coincide with astrometric rotation of brightness centroid and with looping patterns in fractional linear polarization. These signatures can be explained with a model of a bright hot-spot, transiently orbiting the black hole. We extend the capabilities of the existing algorithms to perform parameter estimation and model comparison in the Bayesian framework using NIR observations from the GRAVITY instrument, and simultaneously fitting to the astrometric and polarimetric data. Using the numerical radiative transfer code ipole, we defined several geometric models describing a hot-spot orbiting Sgr A*, threaded with magnetic field, and emitting synchrotron radiation. We then explored the posterior space of our models in the Bayesian framework with a nested sampling code dynesty. We have used 11 models to sharpen our understanding of the importance of various aspects of the orbital model, such as non-Keplerian motion, hot-spot size, and off-equatorial orbit. All considered models converge to realizations that fit the data well, but the equatorial super-Keplerian model is favored by the currently available NIR dataset. We have inferred an inclination of ~ 155 deg, which corroborates previous estimates, a preferred period of ~ 70 minutes, and an orbital radius of ~ 12 gravitational radii with the orbital velocity of ~ 1.3 times the Keplerian value. A hot-spot of a diameter smaller than 5 gravitational radii is favored. Black hole spin is not constrained well.</description>

      <title>On the Progenitor of the Crab Pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crab supernova is interesting because we know that it was not a binary at death, the outcome was a neutron star, and because of the supernova remnant's apparently low energy and mass. Using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and photometry, we examine the stellar population local to the Crab in a cylinder with a projected radius of 100 pc and parallax range $0.427 &lt; \varpi &lt; 0.619$ mas set by the uncertainties in the Crab's parallax. We also individually model the most luminous stars local to the Crab. The two most luminous stars are blue, roughly main sequence stars with masses of $\sim11 M_{\odot}$. We estimate the stellar population's age distribution using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. The estimated age distribution of the 205 $M_{G} &lt; 0$ stars modestly favor lower mass stars consistent with an AGB star or a lower mass binary merger as the progenitor, but we cannot rule out higher masses. This may be driven by contamination due to the $\sim700$ pc length of the cylinder in distance.</description>

      <title>UHECR Clustering: Lightest Nuclei from Local Sheet Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) puzzle is reviewed under the hints of a few basic results: clustering, anisotropy, asymmetry, bending, and composition changes with energies. We show how the lightest UHECR nuclei from the nearest AGN or Star-Burst sources, located inside a few Mpc Local Sheets, may explain, at best, the observed clustering of Hot Spots at tens EeV energy. Among the possible local extragalactic candidate sources, we derived the main contribution of very few galactic sources. These are located in the Local Sheet plane within a distance of a few Mpc, ejecting UHECR at a few tens of EeV energy. UHECR also shine at lower energies of several EeV, partially feeding the Auger dipole by LMC and possibly a few nearer galactic sources. For the very recent highest energy UHECR event, if a nucleon, it may be explained by a model based on the scattering of UHE ZeV neutrinos on low-mass relic neutrinos. Such scatterings are capable of correlating, via Z boson resonance, the most distant cosmic sources above the GZK bound with such an enigmatic UHECR event. Otherwise, these extreme events, if made by the heaviest composition, could originate from the largest bending trajectory of heaviest nuclei or from nearby sources, even galactic ones. In summary, the present lightest to heavy nuclei model UHECR from the Local Sheet could successfully correlate UHECR clustering with the nearest galaxies and AGN. Heavy UHECR may shine by being widely deflected from the Local Sheet or from past galactic, GRB, or SGR explosive ejection.</description>

      <title>Superflare of a Sun-like star observed with XMM-Newton and SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied X-ray source SRGe J021932.4$-$040154 (SRGe J02193), which we associated with a single X-ray active star of spectral class G2V$-$G4V and the rotational period $\rm P_{rot} &lt; 9.3$ days. Additional analysis of TESS light-curves allowed for the rotational period estimation of $3.2 \pm 0.5$ days. SRGe J02193 was observed with the SRG/eROSITA during eUDS survey in 2019 in a much dimmer state compared to the XMM-Newton catalogue 4XMM-DR12. Detailed analysis revealed that the archival XMM-Newton observations captured the source during a flaring event in 2017. The XMM-Newton light curve demonstrates a strong flare described with the Gaussian rise and exponential decay, typical for stellar flares, characterized by timescales of ${\sim}400$ s and ${\sim}1300$ s, respectively. The spectral analysis of the quiescent state reveals ${\sim}10$ MK plasma at luminosity of $(1.4\pm0.4) \times 10^{29} \rm~erg~s^{-1}$ (0.3$-$4.5 keV). The spectrum of the flare is characterized by temperature of ${\sim}40$ MK and luminosity $(5.5\pm0.6)\times 10^{30} \rm~erg~s^{-1}$. The total energy emitted during the flare ${\sim}1.7 \times 10^{34}$ erg exceeds the canonical threshold of $10^{33}$ erg, allowing us to classify the observed event as a superflare on a Sun-like star. Additionally, we present the upper limit on the surface starspot area based on the brightness variations and consider the hypothesis of the object being a binary system with G-type and M-type stars, suggested by two independent estimations of radial velocity variations from APOGEE-2 and Gaia.</description>

      <title>Numerical $\texttt{AXP4}$ Simulations of Pulse Profiles for Binary Accreting X-ray Pulsars $-$ II: A Case Study of Centaurus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pulse shapes simulated in the accompanying paper Part $-$ I are compared with observations of a model binary accreting X-ray pulsar, Centaurus X-3. With known Cen X-3 inclination angles provided as input to the $\texttt{AXP4}$ code, the generated pulse profile is suitably compared with the corresponding observed energy-resolved $\textit{AstroSat}$/LAXPC pulse profile. The pulsed fraction is proposed as a robust, quantitative measure for estimating the size of the emission region of Centaurus X-3 by extending the simulations to include spherical caps of varying fractional surface coverage of the neutron star $-$ over the full range of $0-100\%$, up to very large caps (with polar half angle $&gt; 30^{\circ}$). The hotspot radius thus derived drops by an order of magnitude from $12.27$ km to $1.36^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$ km, within the ballpark of the standard model value of $\sim$$1$ km, after including the effect of gravitational light bending, lending further weight to its routine emphasis in the literature. The energy- and luminosity-dependence of the composite gravitationally bent and slab-integrated pulse profiles is further studied. As the pulse profile is sensitive to luminosity variations, the correlation of the size of a finite polar cap and its dependence on X-ray luminosity $-$ through the rate and subsequently, the geometry of accretion $-$ is discussed. Although a single, model pulsar was chosen for this work to exhibit the depth of the physical and astrophysical prospects of such a probe, this exercise can be extended to a wide range of existing X-ray pulse profiles of known binary accreting pulsars available in galactic catalogs, especially, with the possible inclusion of accretion columns (with cylindrical co-ordinate transformation) in the future.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{AXP4}$, a Numerical Simulator of Pulse Profiles for Binary Accreting X-ray Pulsars $-$ I: Beam Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents model pulse profiles from binary accreting X-ray pulsars using high-resolution numerical simulations for pencil and fan emission beam geometries, each with two different optical depths obtained using a new numerical code $\texttt{AXP4}$ developed in this work. Sharp, pointed-peak improvements are obtained in the known flat-top pulse profiles by extrapolating the model emission functions available in the literature over the full range of emission angles for a realistic description. The effect of general relativistic bending of light due to the strong gravity near the neutron star is taken into account, updating previous attempts with new analytic approximations for photon trajectories in curved space-time reported in the literature (including additional flux contribution from the dark unseen face of the pulsar). Incorporating the other general relativistic effect of gravitational red-shift is seen to redden the pulsar beam to increasingly lower energies along the X-ray observing band. Integrating this emission over a circular slab geometry for two antipodal hotspots lying flush at the neutron star polar caps presents smoothened, composite gravitationally bent pulse profiles to the observer. A comparison between the corresponding non-normalized flux profiles is included. For theoretical completeness and reference base, this treatment is applied to isotropic emitters with uniform injection and limb-darkened beams, as well. The possibility of the production of Einstein rings around a pulsar for a limiting value of the compactness parameter is a distinctive feature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-Free Gaunt factors for X-ray absorption by hot plasma in the presence of a strong magnetic field are reported. Modified formulae are used for application to the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions found in accreting pulsar atmospheres. Given upcoming global X-ray polarimetric space missions, these can be used for the construction of an absorption matrix in discrete-ordinate polarised radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Emissions from Neutron Star Merger Remnants: Implications for Nuclear Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observation of binary neutron-star mergers can provide valuable information on the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Here, we investigate to which extent electromagnetic observations of the associated kilonovae allow us to place constraints on the EoS. For this, we use state-of-the-art three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics simulations and detailed nucleosynthesis modeling to connect properties of observed light curves to properties of the accretion disk, and hence, the EoS. Using our general approach, we use multi-messenger observations of GW170817/AT2017gfo to study the impact of various sources of uncertainty on inferences of the EoS. We constrain the radius of a $\rm{1.4 M_\odot}$ neutron star to lie within $\rm{10.19\leq R_{1.4}\leq 13.0}$~km and the maximum mass to be $\rm{M_{TOV}\leq 3.06 M_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>Probing cluster magnetism with embedded and background radio sources in Planck clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields remain an enigmatic part of the content of galaxy clusters. Faraday rotation and depolarisation of extragalactic radio sources are useful probes, but the limited availability of polarised radio sources necessitates stacking clusters to study average magnetic field profiles and correlation scales. We recently presented a VLA survey of the 124 most massive Planck clusters at low redshift ($z&lt;0.35$), where a clear depolarisation trend with the cluster impact parameter was found. In this study, we combine the depolarisation information with the observed rotation measure (RM) and present an investigation into the average magnetic field properties of the sample, using both background sources and sources embedded in clusters. We observe a significant increase in the RM scatter, $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$, closer to the cluster centres. Averaging all 124 clusters, we find a scatter within $R_\mathrm{500}$ of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}=209\pm37$ rad m$^{-2}$, with background sources and cluster members showing similar values ($200\pm33$ and $219\pm66$ rad m$^{-2}$, respectively). In the simple assumption of a uniform magnetic field with a single fluctuation scale $\Lambda_c$, this translates to an average magnetic field strength of $2\,(\Lambda_c/10\mathrm{kpc})^{-0.5}\, \mu$G. The profile of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$ as a function of projected radius is inconsistent with a model that has a simple scaling $B \propto n_e^\eta$, with an observed deficit near the centre of clusters possibly caused by the fact that the highest RM sources near the centre of clusters are depolarised. In a full forward model, we find that the magnetic field power spectrum agrees with the Kolmogorov value, but that none of the Gaussian random field models can fully explain the observed relatively flat profiles. This implies that more sophisticated models of cluster magnetic fields in a cosmological context are needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion Like Particles (ALPs) can be produced in Gamma Ray Bursts, altering the polarization of the electromagnetic emission in these events. For the first time, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization measurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes parameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within astrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated parameter space of ALP dark matter.</description>

      <title>Insight into the occurrence of particle acceleration through the investigation of Wolf-Rayet stars using uGMRT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars produce strong stellar winds that consist of continuous outflows of material at speeds of thousands of km/s. These winds convey large amounts of kinetic power, especially in the case of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. When these winds interact with nearby material, they will likely produce shocks. Among other processes, particle acceleration is expected to occur. This is particularly well established in the case of massive binary systems, where the stellar winds collide, allowing these systems to be identified thanks to the detection of synchrotron radio emission, produced by a population of relativistic particles accelerated in the shocks. Our goal is to investigate the occurrence of particle acceleration among massive stars in their pre-supernova evolution phases. To this end, we observed a subset of five WR stars in the radio domain using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), located in India. The observations were carried out in bands 4 (550-950 MHz) and 5 (1050-1450 MHz) for all the targets. We detected radio emission for only WR 110 in bands 4 and 5. Its thermal spectrum displays a consistent index of +0.74 down to uGMRT bands. The four other targets were not detected and we derived 3$\sigma$ upper limits. Our upper limits in Band 4 are the first provided for these targets below 1 GHz. None of the targets was identified as a synchrotron radio emitter in these radio bands. If some synchrotron emission is produced in these systems, the non-detection with uGMRT can be most likely attributed to strong free-free absorption (FFA). This is especially relevant for WR 98a, which is catalogued as a particle accelerator based on previous measurements at higher radio frequencies. We discuss how the prominence of FFA constitutes a severe obstacle to identifying particle accelerators in the radio domain.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the cosmic p+He energy spectrum from 50 GeV to 0.5 PeV with the DAMPE space mission</title>

Abstract: Recent observations of the light component of the cosmic-ray spectrum have revealed unexpected features that motivate further and more precise measurements up to the highest energies. The Dark Matter Particle Explorer is a satellite-based cosmic-ray experiment that has been operational since December 2015, continuously collecting data on high-energy cosmic particles with very good statistics, energy resolution, and particle identification capabilities. In this work, the latest measurements of the energy spectrum of proton+helium in the energy range from 46 GeV to 464 TeV are presented. Among the most distinctive features of the spectrum, a spectral hardening at 600 GeV has been observed, along with a softening at 29 TeV measured with a 6.6{\sigma} significance. Moreover, the detector features and the analysis approach allowed for the extension of the spectral measurement up to the sub-PeV region. Even if with small statistical significance due to the low number of events, data suggest a new spectral hardening at about 150 TeV.</description>

      <title>Evolution of QPOs in GX 339-4 and EXO 1846-031 with Insight-HXMT and NICER</title>

Abstract: We conduct a spectral and timing analysis of GX 339-4 and EXO 1846-031 with the aim of studying the evolution of Type-C QPOs with spectral parameters. The high cadence data from Insight-HXMT and NICER allow us to track them. Type-C QPOs appear at the end of low-hard state and/or hard-intermediate state. The results reveal that the QPO frequency is closely related to the inner disk radius and mass accretion rate in the two sources. Such a correlation is nicely consistent with the dynamic frequency model.</description>

      <title>Pulse profile variability associated with the glitch of PSR J1048$-$5832</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR J1048$-$5832 (B1046$-$58) is a Vela-like pulsar that has exhibited multiple glitch events. In this study, we analyze the timing data spanning nearly 16 years, acquired from both the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Parkes 64 m radio telescope. As a result, a total of five glitches are detected within this dataset. Among them, a previously unknown small glitch is newly found at MJD 56985(9) (November 24, 2014), making it the smallest glitch recorded from this source so far. The increments of the spin frequency and its first derivative are $\Delta \nu \approx 2.2(3) \times 10^ {-8} $ Hz, and $\Delta \dot{\nu} \approx 3(2) \times 10^ {-15}$ s$^{-2}$, respectively. Significant changes in the integrated normalized mean pulse profile are detected following three of the five glitch events, notably in the radio band. Although no evidence of a correlation is found between the spin-down rate and profile evolution, the jump phenomenon of $W_{55}$ (pulse width at the 55% peak amplitude) after the glitch in the narrow mode suggests that the glitch may influence the profile change. We discuss the influence of glitches on the pulsar's emission properties in terms of platelet motion by a crustquake and also put constraints on the equation of state from the moment of inertia and response timescales of involved superfluid layers inside the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Flux Density Stability and Temporal Changes in the Spectra of Millisecond Pulsars using the GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of spectral properties of 10 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered by the uGMRT, observed from 2017-2023 using band 3 (300-500 MHz) and 4 (550-750 MHz) of uGMRT. For these MSPs, we have reported a range of spectral indices from ~0 to -4.8, while averaging the full observing band and all the observing epochs. For every MSP, we calculated the mean flux densities across 7-8 sub-bands each with approximately 25 MHz bandwidth spanning band 3 and band 4. We computed their modulation indices as well as average and maximum-to-median flux densities within each subband. Using a temporal variation of flux density we calculated the refractive scintillation time scales and estimated structure function with time lag for 8 MSPs in the sample. We note a significant temporal evolution of the in-band spectra, classified into three categories based on the nature of the best-fit power-law spectra, having single positive spectral indices, multiple broken power law, and single negative spectral indices. Additionally, indications of low-frequency turnover and a temporal variation of the turnover frequency (to the extent that turnover was observed for some of the epochs while not seen for the rest) were noted for all the MSPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation probing temporal changes in the MSP spectra as well as in turnover frequency. Future exploration with dense monitoring combined with modeling of spectra can provide vital insight into the intrinsic emission properties of the MSPs and ISM properties.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Investigation of $\gamma$-ray Source MGRO J1908+06 Emission Using Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission from MGRO J1908+06 in the GeV-TeV energy band. By analyzing the data collected by {\it Fermi}-LAT, VERITAS, and HAWC, with the addition of spectral data previously reported by LHAASO, a multiwavelength (MW) study of the morphological and spectral features of MGRO J1908+06 provides insight into the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. The mechanism behind the bright TeV emission is studied by constraining the magnetic field strength, the source age and the distance through detailed broadband modeling. Both spectral shape and energy-dependent morphology support the scenario that inverse-Compton (IC) emission of an evolved pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J1907+0602 is responsible for the MGRO J1908+06 $\gamma$-ray emission with a best-fit true age of $T=22\pm 9$ kyr and a magnetic field of $B=5.4 \pm 0.8\ \mu\mathrm{G}$, assuming the distance to the pulsar $d_{\mathrm{PSR}}=3.2$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Constraining the abundance of Galactic compact objects with continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with non-zero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars), and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs, from searches in LIGO-Virgo data, have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count $N_{tot}$ of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an "agnostic" set of upper limits on $N_{tot}$ evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ have abundance upper limits at $90\%$ confidence, of $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 100$, and those with $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ have $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 10^4$. We additionally place upper-limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances $N_{tot}$.</description>

      <title>Morphological Evidence for the eROSITA Bubbles Being Giant and Distant Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are two contradictory views of the eROSITA bubbles: either a 10 kpc-scale pair of giant bubbles blown by the Galactic center (GC), or a 100 pc-scale local structure coincidentally located in the direction of GC. A key element of this controversy is the distance to the bubbles. Based on the 3D dust distribution in the Galactic plane, we found three isolated, distant (500-800 pc) clouds at intermediate Galactic latitudes. Their projected morphologies perfectly match the X-ray shadows on the defining features of the north eROSITA bubble, i.e., the North Polar Spur (NPS) and the Lotus Petal Cloud (LPC), indicating that both the NPS and LPC are distant with a distance lower limit of nearly 1kpc. In the X-ray dark region between the NPS and LPC, we found a few polarized radio arcs and attributed them to the bubble's shock front. These arcs match up perfectly with the outer border of the NPS and LPC and provide a way to define the bubble's border. The border defined in this way can be well described by the line-of-sight tangent of a 3D skewed cup model rooted in the GC. We conclude that, instead of being two independent, distant features, NPS and LPC compose a single, giant bubble, which, therefore, is most plausibly a 10-kpc scale bubble rooted at the GC.</description>

Abstract: We present a parameter estimation algorithm on kilonova light curves using likelihood-free inference. Our inference is optimized through a pre-trained embedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity distance of the signal. We find that parameter inference utilizing a pre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone, reducing training time and offering the capability to marginalize over certain nuisance parameters. The model is capable of retrieving the intrinsic parameters of the kilonova light curves with a comparable accuracy and precision to nested sampling methods while taking significantly less computational time. This framework has been integrated into the publicly available Nuclear Multi-Messenger Astronomy codebase so users can leverage the model for their inference purposes. This algorithm is broadly applicable to parameterized or simulated light curves of other transient objects.</description>
