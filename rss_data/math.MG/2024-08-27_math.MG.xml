      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex hypersurfaces in the half-space with capillary boundary. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to [16, Conjecture 1.5] on the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for quermassintegrals for convex capillary hypersurfaces in the Euclidean half-space. More generally, we establish a theory for capillary convex bodies in the half-space and prove a general Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for mixed volumes of capillary convex bodies. The conjecture [16, Conjecture 1.5] follows as its consequence.</description>

      <title>Products of hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of uniformly smooth hyperbolic spaces was recently introduced by Pinto as a common generalization of both CAT(0) spaces and uniformly smooth Banach spaces, in a way that Reich's theorem on resolvent convergence could still be proven. We define products of such spaces, showing that they are reasonably well-behaved. In this manner, we provide the first example of a space for which Reich's theorem holds and which is neither a CAT(0) space, nor a convex subset of a normed space.</description>

      <title>Exploiting degeneracy in projective geometric algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last two decades, since the seminal work of Selig, has seen projective geometric algebra (PGA) gain popularity as a modern coordinate-free framework for doing classical Euclidean geometry and other Cayley-Klein geometries. This framework is based upon a degenerate Clifford algebra, and it is the purpose of this paper to delve deeper into its internal algebraic structure and extract meaningful information for the purposes of PGA. This includes exploiting the split extension structure to realise the natural decomposition of elements of this Clifford algebra into Euclidean and ideal parts. This leads to a beautiful demonstration of how Playfair's axiom for affine geometry arises from the ambient degenerate quadratic space. The highlighted split extension property of the Clifford algebra also corresponds to a splitting of the group of units and the Lie algebra of bivectors. Central to these results is that the degenerate Clifford algebra $\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ is isomorphic to the twisted trivial extension $\mathrm{Cl}(V/\langle e_0\rangle)\ltimes_\alpha\mathrm{Cl}(V/\langle e_0\rangle)$, where $e_0$ is a degenerate vector and $\alpha$ is the grade-involution.</description>

      <title>Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value of inhomogenous random rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times n}$ ($N \geq n$) be a random matrix with columns that are mean 0 and isotropic and with independent entries having bounded $2+\beta$ moments. We show that the smallest singular value $\sigma_n(A)$ satisfies
  \[
  \Pr \left(\sigma_n(A) \leq \varepsilon(\sqrt{N+1} - \sqrt{n})\right) \leq (C\varepsilon)^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},
  \]
  for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $c,C$ depend only on $\beta$ and the $2+\beta$ moments. This extends earlier results of Rudelson and Vershynin, who showed that such lower tail estimates held for rectangular matrices with i.i.d. mean-0 subgaussian entries. When the $2+\beta$ moment assumption is replaced with a uniform anti-concentration assumption, $\sup_z \Pr\left(|X-z| &lt; a\right) &lt; b$, we show that
  \[
  \Pr\left(\sigma_n(A) \leq \varepsilon(\sqrt{N+1} - \sqrt{n})\right) \leq (C\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon))^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},
  \]
  where $c_2,C_3$ now depend only on $a$ and $b$. This extends more recent work of Livshyts, whose showed that such lower tail estimates held for rectrangular matrices with i.i.d. rows. To prove these results we employ a number of new technical ingredients, including a new deviation inequality for the regularized Hilbert-Schmidt norm and a recently proven small ball estimate for the distance between a random vector and a subspace spanned by an inhomogeneous rectangular matrix.</description>

      <title>Quantitative upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces measures how far the spaces are from being isometric. It has played an important and longstanding role in geometry and shape comparison. More recently, it has been discovered that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between unit spheres equipped with the geodesic metric has important connections to Borsuk-Ulam theorems and Vietoris-Rips complexes.
  We develop a discrete framework for obtaining upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres, and provide the first quantitative bounds that apply to spheres of all possible pairs of dimensions. As a special case, we determine the exact Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the circle and any higher-dimensional sphere, and determine the precise asymptotic behavior of the distance from the 2-sphere to the $k$-sphere up to constants.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, in a neighborhood of the Euclidean ball, there are no other fixed points of the $p$-centroid body operator, using spherical harmonic techniques. We also show that the Euclidean ball is locally the only body whose centroid body is a dilate of its polar intersection body.</description>

      <title>Two conjectures on coarse conjugacy by Geller and Misiurewicz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of coarse entropy, W. Geller and M. Misiurewicz introduced the notion of coarse conjugacy: a version of conjugacy appropriate for dynamics on metric spaces observed from afar. They made two conjectures on coarse conjugacy generalising their results. We disprove both of these conjectures. We investigate the impact of extra assumptions on the validity of the conjectures: We show that the result of Geller and Misiurewicz towards one of the conjectures can be considered optimal, and we prove the other conjecture under an assumption complementary to that from the referenced work.</description>

      <title>Convex Equipartitions inspired by the little cubes operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decade ago two groups of authors, Karasev, Hubard and Aronov, and Blagojevi\'c and Ziegler, have shown that the regular convex partitions of a Euclidean space into $n$ parts yield a solution to the generalised Nandakumar and Ramana-Rao conjecture when $n$ is a prime power. This was obtained by parametrising the space of regular equipartitions of a given convex body with the classical configuration space.
  Now, we repeat the process of regular convex equipartitions many times, first partitioning the Euclidean space into $n_1$ parts, then each part into $n_2$ parts, and so on. In this way we obtain iterated convex equipartions of a given convex body into $n=n_1...n_k$ parts. Such iterated partitions are parametrised by the (wreath) product of classical configuration spaces. We develop a new configuration space -- test map scheme for solving the generalised Nandakumar \&amp; Ramana-Rao conjecture using the Hausdorff metric on the space of iterated convex equipartions.
  The new scheme yields a solution to the conjecture if and only if all the $n_i$'s are powers of the same prime. In particular, for the failure of the scheme outside prime power case we give three different proofs.</description>
