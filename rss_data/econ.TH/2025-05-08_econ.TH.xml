      <title>Robust Online Learning with Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of online learning algorithms when learners possess private information. No-external-regret algorithms, prevalent in machine learning, are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, allowing an adaptive opponent to extract full surplus. Even standard no-weak-external-regret algorithms, designed for optimal learning in stationary environments, exhibit similar vulnerabilities. This raises a fundamental question: can a learner simultaneously prevent full surplus extraction by adaptive opponents while maintaining optimal performance in well-behaved environments? To address this, we model the problem as a two-player repeated game, where the learner with private information plays against the environment, facing ambiguity about the environment's types: stationary or adaptive. We introduce \emph{partial safety} as a key design criterion for online learning algorithms to prevent full surplus extraction. We then propose the \emph{Explore-Exploit-Punish} (\textsf{EEP}) algorithm and prove that it satisfies partial safety while achieving optimal learning in stationary environments, and has a variant that delivers improved welfare performance. Our findings highlight the risks of applying standard online learning algorithms in strategic settings with adverse selection. We advocate for a shift toward online learning algorithms that explicitly incorporate safeguards against strategic manipulation while ensuring strong learning performance.</description>

      <title>Housing Bubbles with Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11365v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze how equilibrium housing prices are determined in the process of economic development within an overlapping generations model with perfect housing and rental markets. We characterize the rent growth rate in all equilibria. The economy exhibits a two-stage phase transition: as incomes of home buyers rise, the equilibrium regime changes from fundamental to bubble possibility, where fundamental and bubbly equilibria coexist. With even higher incomes, fundamental equilibria disappear and housing bubbles become a necessity. We also discuss extensions and refinements such as equilibrium uniqueness, multiple savings vehicles, welfare implications, credit- and expectation-driven bubbles, and testable implications of our theory.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Across Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We train two neural networks adversarially to play static games. At each iteration, a row and column network observe a new random bimatrix game and output individual mixed strategies. The parameters of each network are independently updated via stochastic gradient descent on a loss defined by the individual squared regret experienced in the game. Simulations show the joint behavior of the trained networks approximates a Nash equilibrium in all games. In $2\times2$ games with multiple equilibria, the networks select the risk dominant equilibrium. These findings, which are robust and generalise out-of-distribution, illustrate how equilibrium emerges from learning across heterogeneous games.</description>

      <title>Risk aggregation and stochastic dominance for a class of heavy-tailed distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of heavy-tailed distributions for which any weighted average of independent and identically distributed random variables is larger than one such random variable in (usual) stochastic order. We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\'echet, and Burr distributions, belong to this class. The established stochastic dominance relation can be further generalized to allow negatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In particular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random variables dominates their distribution mixtures in stochastic order.</description>
