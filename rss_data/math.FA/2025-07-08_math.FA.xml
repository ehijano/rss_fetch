      <title>A Study of Kirk's Asymptotic Contractions via Leader Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates asymptotic fixed point results for nonlinear contractions, with emphasis on Kirk-type theorems and their generalizations. A central difficulty in the literature has been the requirement that the mapping possesses a bounded orbit, a condition that is often hard to verify and traditionally viewed as essential for guaranteeing the existence of fixed points.
  We eliminate this boundedness assumption by proving that every asymptotic Kirk contraction is a Leader contraction, which inherently guarantees orbit boundedness. This observation simplifies fixed point arguments and broadens the scope of applicable mappings.
  We also resolve an open question by showing that the standard upper semicontinuity condition on the control function phi can be weakened to right-upper semicontinuity, addressing a conjecture posed by Jachymski et al.
  These contributions unify and generalize several foundational results, including those of Boyd-Wong, Kirk, Chen, Arav et al., and Reich and Zaslavski, under the more flexible framework of Leader contractions. The results offer streamlined and more practical conditions for convergence and fixed point existence in generalized metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Certain Upper Bounds on the $A$-Numerical Radius of Operators in Semi-Hilbertian Spaces and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a complex Hilbert space $\left(\mathcal{H}, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\right)$ equipped with a positive bounded linear operator $A$ on $\mathcal{H}$. This induces a semi-norm $\|\cdot\|_A$ through the semi-inner product $\langle x, y \rangle_A = \langle Ax, y \rangle$ for $x, y \in \mathcal{H}$. In this semi-Hilbertian space setting, we investigate the $A$-numerical radius $w_A(T)$ and $A$-operator semi-norm $\|T\|_A$ of bounded operators $T$. This paper presents significant improvements to existing upper bounds for the $A$-numerical radius of operators in semi-Hilbertian spaces. We establish several new inequalities that provide sharper estimates than those currently available in the literature. Notably, we refine the triangle inequality for the $A$-operator semi-norm, offering more precise characterizations of operator behavior. To validate our theoretical advancements, we provide concrete examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our results. These examples illustrate how our bounds offer tighter estimates compared to previous ones, confirming the practical relevance of our findings. Our work contributes to the broader understanding of numerical radius inequalities and their applications in operator theory, with potential implications for functional analysis and related fields.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Toeplitz operators on vector-valued Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we completely classify invariant subspaces of certain finite-rank perturbations of Toeplitz operators on vector-valued Hardy spaces. As a byproduct, we describe invariant subspaces, almost invariant subspaces, and nearly invariant subspaces associated with a class of Toeplitz operators in the vector-valued setting. Additionally, we investigate a generalization of the concept of nearly invariant subspaces for the finite defect case.</description>

      <title>The Daugavet property is equivalent to the polynomial Daugavet property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the Daugavet property implies the polynomial Daugavet property, solving a longstanding open problem in the field. Our approach is based on showing that a geometric characterization of the Daugavet property due to Shvidkoy, originally formulated in terms of the weak topology, remains valid when the weak topology is replaced by the weak polynomial topology. Using similar techniques, we further establish that every linear Daugavet center is also a polynomial Daugavet center, and that the weak operator Daugavet property implies its polynomial counterpart. As an application of the latter result, we present new examples of Banach spaces whose $N$-fold symmetric tensor products satisfy the Daugavet property.</description>

      <title>Exact and efficient basis pursuit denoising via differential inclusions and a selection principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is a cornerstone of compressive sensing, statistics and machine learning. While various algorithms for BPDN have been proposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor efficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art algorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require accurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this work, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for BPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection principle from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of BPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \emph{integrable} projected dynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be computed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and very fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show that the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and data) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm for BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions to basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time. Beyond this work, we expect that our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Fourier frames on smooth surfaces with nonvanishing Gaussian curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that a small spherical cap (rigorously its surface measure) admits Fourier frames, while the whole sphere does not. In this paper, we prove more general results. Consequences indclude that a small spherical cap in $\mathbb{R}^d$ near the north pole cannot have a frame spectrum near the $x_d$-axis, and $S$ does not admit any Fourier frame if its interior contains a closed hemisphere. We also resolve the endpoint case, that is, a hemisphere does not admit any Fourier frame. This answers a question of Kolountzakis and Lai. Our results also hold on more general smooth surfaces with nonvanishing Gaussian curvature. In particular, any compact $(d-1)$-dimensional smooth submanifold immersed in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with nonvanishing Gaussian curvature does not admit any Fourier frame. This generalizes a previous result of Iosevich, Lai, Wyman and the second author on the boundary of convex bodies, as well as improves a recent result of Kolountzakis and Lai from tight frame to frame.</description>

      <title>Online Regularized Learning Algorithms in RKHS with $\beta$- and $\phi$-Mixing Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an online regularized learning algorithm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on a class of dependent processes. We choose such a process where the degree of dependence is measured by mixing coefficients. As a representative example, we analyze a strictly stationary Markov chain, where the dependence structure is characterized by the \(\phi\)- and \(\beta\)-mixing coefficients. Under these assumptions, we derive probabilistic upper bounds as well as convergence rates for both the exponential and polynomial decay of the mixing coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We derive a complete left-tail asymptotic series for the density of the {\it martingale limit} of a supercritical multitype Galton-Watson process in the Schr\"oder case. We show that the series converges everywhere, not only for small arguments. This is the first complete result regarding the left tails of multitype branching processes. A good, quickly computed approximation for the density will also be derived from the series.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>

      <title>Finitely $C^\infty$-generated associative and Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras, which can be treated as `algebras of functions' on non-commutative $C^\infty$-differentiable spaces. Our approach uses the category of projective limits of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth. We prove the existence of some universal constructions in this and some similar categories. By analogy with holomorphically finitely generated algebras of Pirkovskii, a finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebra is defined as a quotient of a finite-rank algebra of `free $C^\infty$-functions'. The latter notion was introduced by the author in a previous article, where a structure theorem for algebras of `free $C^\infty$-functions' was announced and proved in dimension at most $2$. Here this theorem is proved in full generality.
  The central result asserts that the projective tensor product of a finite tuple of finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras is finitely $C^\infty$-generated. In particular, this makes it natural to consider finitely $C^\infty$-generated topological Hopf algebras. Furthermore, a construction called `envelope' provides a functor from the category of affine real Hopf algebras to the category of finitely $C^\infty$-generated Hopf algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cordes' characterization of Heisenberg-smooth operators bridges a gap between the theory of pseudo-differential operators and quantum harmonic analysis (QHA). We give a new proof of the result by using the phase space formalism of QHA. Our argument is flexible enough to generalize Cordes' result in several directions: (1) We can admit general quantization schemes, (2) allow for other phase space geometries, (3) obtain Schatten class analogs of the result, and (4) are able to characterize precisely 'Heisenberg-analytic' operators. For (3), we use QHA to derive Schatten versions of the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt theorem, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Inequalities for the $A$-Norm and $A$-Numerical Radius of Operator Sums in Semi-Hilbertian Spaces with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes several new inequalities for the $A$-norm and $A$-numerical radius of operator sums in semi-Hilbertian spaces, significantly advancing the existing theory. We present two fundamental refinements of the generalized triangle inequality for operator norms, providing sharper estimates than previously known results. Our investigation yields novel bounds for the $A$-numerical radius of products and commutators of operators, with particular attention to their Cartesian decompositions. The developed framework enables applications to quantum mechanics, where we derive improved uncertainty relations and perturbation bounds, and to partial differential equations, where we obtain stability estimates for nonlocal elliptic operators. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the optimality of our inequalities and their advantages over classical results. The theoretical contributions are complemented by potential applications in functional analysis, operator theory, and mathematical physics, suggesting directions for future research in semi-Hilbertian operator theory.</description>

      <title>On the Boundedness of Generalized Fractional Integral Operators in Morrey Spaces and Camapanato Spaces associated with the Dunkl Operator on the Real line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $I_\beta$ $(0 &lt; \beta &lt; 2\alpha + 2 =d_\alpha)$ is bounded from $L^p(\R,d\mu_\alpha)$ to $L^q (\R, d\mu_\alpha)$ when $1 &lt; p &lt; \frac{d_\alpha}{\beta}$ and $\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{q} = \frac{\beta}{d_\alpha}$. In \cite{spsa} , the authors introduced the generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $T_\rho^\alpha$ and it's modified version $\tilde{T}_\rho^\alpha$ and extended the above boundedness results to the generalized Dunkl-type Morrey spaces and Dunkl-type $BMO_\phi$ spaces. In this paper we investigate the boundedness of generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operators and it's modified version mainly on the Dunkl-type Campanato space.</description>

      <title>The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform: structure, convolution theorem and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03911</link>

Abstract: The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform (WQPFT) combines the localization capabilities of windowed transforms with the phase modulation structure of the quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT). This paper investigates fundamental properties of the WQPFT, including linearity, shifting, modulation, conjugation, and symmetry. In addition, we derive the reproducing kernel, establish a reconstruction formula, and characterize the range of the transform. Convolution theorems in both the spectral and spatial domains are developed, along with the existence results and norm estimates for the convolution operation associated with the WQPFT. Finally, as an application, the solution of a convolution equation is given using the convolution theorem of the WQPFT.</description>

Abstract: We investigate linear operators $A:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. We give explicit operators $A$ such that, for fixed $d\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)_{\leq 2d}\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{\leq d}^2$. We give an explicit operator $A$ such that $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(\mathbb{R}^n)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. For $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, we give a condition such that $A$ exists with $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. We show that, for compact $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, there is no bijective linear operator $T:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with $T\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. In the framework of regular Fr\'echet Lie groups and Lie algebras we investigate the linear operators $A$ such that $e^{tA}:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is well-defined for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. We give a three-line-proof of Stochel's Theorem.</description>
