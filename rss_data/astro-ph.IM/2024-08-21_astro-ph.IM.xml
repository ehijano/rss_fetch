      <title>Pan-African Citizen Science e-Lab: An Emerging Online Platform for Astronomy Research, Education and Outreach in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citizen science offers an opportunity for ordinary people, known as citizen scientists or citizen astronomers in the context of astronomy, to contribute to scientific research. The Pan-African Citizen Science e-Lab (PACS e-Lab) was founded to promote and engage the African public in citizen science and soft astronomy research to advance space research and exploration and enhance space education and outreach. PACS e-Lab, in collaboration with several international astronomy research, education, and outreach organizations, currently runs several projects including but not limited to asteroid search, exoplanet photometry, research writing for peer-reviewed publications, astrophoto visual development, and Amateur Radio contact with astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ARISS). Despite several challenges, the group has engaged over 600 Africans from more than 40 countries and is working towards covering the entire continent in the future. PACS e-Lab's development efforts resonate with seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs).</description>

      <title>Characterization of X-ray Detectors in the MIT X-ray Polarimetry Beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIT X-ray Polarimetry Beamline is a facility that we developed for testing components for possible use in X-ray polarimetry. Over the past few years, we have demonstrated that the X-ray source can generate nearly 100% polarized X-rays at various energies from 183 eV (Boron K$\alpha$) to 705 eV (Fe L$\alpha$) using a laterally graded multilayer coated mirror (LGML) oriented at 45\deg\ to the source. The position angle of the polarization can be rotated through a range of roughly 150\deg. In a downstream chamber, we can orient a Princeton Instruments MTE1300B CCD camera to observe the polarized light either directly or after reflection at 45\deg\ by a second LGML. In support of the REDSoX Polarimeter project, we have tested four other detectors by directly comparing them to the PI camera. Two were CCD cameras: a Raptor Eagle XV and a CCID94 produced by MIT Lincoln Laboratories, and two had sCMOS sensors: the Sydor Wraith with a GSENSE 400BSI sensor and a custom Sony IMX290 sensor. We will show results comparing quantum efficiencies and event images in the soft X-ray band.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of a particle detector derived from nitride read-only memory (NROM) technology is evaluated, with immediate applications in space-based heavy ion radiation monitoring and detection. Irradiation exposures are performed using 40 MeV/u $^{78}$Kr and 10 MeV/u $^4$He particle beams at the Texas A&amp;M University Cyclotron Institute. The results show a strong sensitivity to high-Z heavy ions, and medium sensitivity to low-Z heavy ions.</description>

      <title>Microlensing brown-dwarf companions in binaries detected during the 2022 and 2023 seasons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on previous works to construct a homogeneous sample of brown dwarfs in binary systems, we investigate microlensing events detected by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey during the 2022 and 2023 seasons. Given the difficulty in distinguishing brown-dwarf events from those produced by binary lenses with nearly equal-mass components, we analyze all lensing events detected during the seasons that exhibit anomalies characteristic of binary-lens systems. Using the same criteria consistently applied in previous studies, we identify six additional brown dwarf candidates through the analysis of lensing events KMT-2022-BLG-0412, KMT-2022-BLG-2286, KMT-2023-BLG-0201, KMT-2023-BLG-0601, KMT-2023-BLG-1684, and KMT-2023-BLG-1743. An examination of the mass posteriors shows that the median mass of the lens companions ranges from 0.02 $M_\odot$ to 0.05 $M_\odot$, indicating that these companions fall within the brown-dwarf mass range. The mass of the primary lenses ranges from 0.11 $M_\odot$ to 0.68 $M_\odot$, indicating that they are low-mass stars with substantially lower masses compared to the Sun.</description>

      <title>Embedding Ordinality to Binary Loss Function for Improving Solar Flare Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel loss function aimed at optimizing the binary flare prediction problem by embedding the intrinsic ordinal flare characteristics into the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function. This modification is intended to provide the model with better guidance based on the ordinal characteristics of the data and improve the overall performance of the models. For our experiments, we employ a ResNet34-based model with transfer learning to predict $\geq$M-class flares by utilizing the shape-based features of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches spanning from $-$90$^{\circ}$ to $+$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude as our input data. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, which is calculated as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare our models' performance. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel approach to encode ordinality into a binary loss function showing an application to solar flare prediction, (ii) We enhance solar flare forecasting by enabling flare predictions for each AR across the entire solar disk, without any longitudinal restrictions, and evaluate and compare performance. (iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposed loss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for AR patches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solar longitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts, leading to more effective prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Technical requirements flow-down for the concept design of the novel 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submm Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Aperture Submm Telescope (AtLAST) is a concept for a novel 50-meter class single-dish telescope operating at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths (30-950 GHz). The telescope will provide an unprecedentedly wide field of view (FoV) of 1-2 degree diameter with a large receiver cabin housing six major instruments in Nasmyth and Cassegrain positions. The high observing frequencies, combined with the scanning operation movements with up to 3 deg/second, place high demands on the accuracy and stability of the optical and structural components. The design features the introduction of a rocking chair type mount with an iso-statically decoupled main reflector backup structure and an active main reflector surface with a high precision metrology system. The planned site location is in the Chilean Atacama Desert at approximately 5050 meters above sea level, near Llano de Chajnantor. This paper gives an overview of the optical, structural, and mechanical design concepts. It explains the flow-down from key science requirements to technical design decisions as well as showing design analogies from other existing large radio, (sub-)mm, and optical telescopes.</description>

      <title>AtLAST Science Overview Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Effect of Tilted Corner Cube Reflector Arrays on Lunar Laser Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the effect of the tilt of corner cube reflector (CCR) arrays on lunar laser ranging (LLR). A mathematical model was established to study the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR arrays. The study found that, ideally, when the laser ranging pulse width is 10 picoseconds or less, it is possible to distinguish from which specific corner cubes within the CCR array each peak in the echo signal originates. Consequently, partial data from the echo can be extracted for signal processing, significantly reducing random errors and improving the single-shot precision of LLR. The distance obtained by extracting part of the echo can be reduced to the center position of the array, thereby providing multiple higher-precision ranging results from each measurement. This not only improves the precision of LLR but also increases the data volume. A simulation experiment based on the 1.2 m laser ranging system at Yunnan Observatories was conducted. By extracting one peak for signal processing, the single-shot precision improved from 32.24 mm to 2.52 mm, validating the theoretical analysis results. Finally, an experimental laser ranging system based on a 53 cm binocular telescope system was established for ground experiments. The experimental results indicated that the echo signal could identify the tilt state of the CCR array. By extracting the peak returned by the central CCR for signal processing, the ranging precision was greatly improved. Through theoretical analyses, simulation experiments, and ground experiments, a solution to reduce the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR array was provided. This offers an approach to enhance the single-shot precision of future LLR and provides a reference for upgrading ground-based equipment at future laser ranging stations.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background with space-borne networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single gravitational-wave detectors face inherent limitations in detecting the anisotropy of the stochastic background. In this work, we explore the sensitivity to anisotropic backgrounds with a network of space-borne detectors. We find that the separation between detectors plays an important role in determining the sensitivity. For the first time, we observe as large as three orders of magnitude enhancement in detection sensitivity for the multipoles with $l=5$ and 6, compared to coinciding detectors. Coordinating and optimizing the separation between two space-borne detectors can significantly enhance the network's sensitivity to the multipole components of the stochastic background. For the TianQin + LISA network, benefiting from detector separation, it is possible to achieve sensitivity levels of 2-3 orders of magnitude better than using TianQin or LISA detector alone. These findings pave the way to uncover the underlying physics of anisotropy through gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>Detecting cosmological scalar fields using orbital networks of quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose to detect the interaction of a hypothetical coherently evolving cosmological scalar field with an orbital network of quantum sensors, focusing on the GPS satellite network as a test example. Cosmological scenarios, such as a scalar-tensor theory for dark energy or the axi-Higgs model, suggest that such a field may exist. As this field would be (approximately) at rest in the CMB frame, it would exhibit a dipole as a result of the movement of our terrestrial observers relative to the CMB. While the current sensitivity of the GPS network is insufficient to detect a cosmological dipole, future networks of quantum sensors on heliocentric orbits, using state-of-the-art atomic clocks, can reach and exceed this requirement.</description>

Abstract: Atmospheric escape is thought to significantly influence the evolution of exoplanets, especially for sub-Jupiter planets on short orbital periods. Theoretical models predict that hydrodynamic escape could erode the atmospheres of such gaseous planets, leaving only a rocky core. Deriving atmospheric mass-loss rates from observations is necessary to check these predictions. One of the ways to obtain mass-loss rate estimates is to fit transit spectra of the 10830 {\AA} helium or UV metal lines with Parker wind models. We aim to provide the community with a tool that enables performing this type of analysis, and present sunbather, an open-source Python code to model escaping exoplanet atmospheres and their transit spectra. sunbather incorporates the Parker wind code p-winds and the photoionization code Cloudy, with the ability to calculate any currently known spectral tracer at an arbitrary atmospheric composition. With sunbather, we investigate how the atmospheric structure of a generic hot Neptune planet depends on the metallicity. We find that the mass-loss rate drops by roughly one order of magnitude as we increase the metallicity from solar to 50 times solar. Line cooling by metal species is important already for a solar composition, and more so at higher metallicity. We then demonstrate how sunbather can be used to interpret observations of spectral lines that form in the upper atmosphere. We fit the observed helium spectrum of the mini-Neptune TOI-2134 b and show how even for helium data, the inferred mass-loss rate depends on the metallicity by up to a factor of three.</description>

      <title>New search pipeline for gravitational waves with higher-order modes using mode-by-mode filtering</title>

Abstract: Nearly all template-based gravitational wave (GW) searches only include the quasi-circular quadrupolar modes of the signals in their templates. Including additional degrees of freedom in the GW templates corresponding to higher-order harmonics, orbital precession, or eccentricity is challenging because: ($i$) the size of template banks and the matched-filtering cost increases significantly with the number of degrees of freedom, $(ii)$ if these additional degrees are not included properly, the search can lose sensitivity overall (due to an increase in the rate of background triggers). Here, we focus on including aligned-spin higher harmonics in GW search templates. We use a new mode-by-mode filtering approach, where we separately filter GW strain data with three harmonics [namely $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$]. This results in an increase in the matched-filtering cost by only a factor of $3$ compared to that of a $(2,2)$-only search. We develop computationally cheap trigger-ranking statistics to optimally combine the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) timeseries from different harmonics, which ensure only physically-allowed combinations of the different harmonics are triggered on. We use an empirical template-dependent background model in our ranking statistic to account for non-Gaussian transients. In addition, we develop a tool called band eraser which specifically excises narrow time-varying noisy bands in time-frequency space (without having to excise entire time chunks in the data). New GW candidate events that we detect using our $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and the details of our template banks are discussed in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Apart from higher harmonics, we expect our methodology to also be useful for cheap and optimal searches including orbital precession and eccentricity in GW waveforms.</description>
