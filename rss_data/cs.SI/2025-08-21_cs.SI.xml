      <title>The Chilling: Identifying Strategic Antisocial Behavior Online and Examining the Impact on Journalists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On social platforms like Twitter, strategic targeted attacks are becoming increasingly common, especially against vulnerable groups such as female journalists. Two key challenges in identifying strategic online behavior are the complex structure of online conversations and the hidden nature of potential strategies that drive user behavior. To address these, we develop a new tree structured Transformer model that categorizes replies based on their hierarchical conversation structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed classification model can effectively detect different user groups, namely attackers, supporters, and bystanders, and their latent strategies. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply this classifier to real time Twitter data and conduct a series of quantitative analyses on the interactions between journalists with different groups of users. Our classification approach allows us to not only explore strategic behaviors of attackers but also those of supporters and bystanders who engage in online interactions. When examining the impact of online attacks, we find a strong correlation between the presence of attackers' interactions and chilling effects, where journalists tend to slow their subsequent posting behavior. This paper provides a deeper understanding of how different user groups engage in online discussions and highlights the detrimental effects of attacker presence on journalists, other users, and conversational outcomes. Our findings underscore the need for social platforms to develop tools that address coordinated toxicity. By detecting patterns of coordinated attacks early, platforms could limit the visibility of toxic content to prevent escalation. Additionally, providing journalists and users with tools for real time reporting could empower them to manage hostile interactions more effectively.</description>

      <title>HIP: Model-Agnostic Hypergraph Influence Prediction via Distance-Centrality Fusion and Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting user influence in social networks is a critical problem, and hypergraphs, as a prevalent higher-order modeling approach, provide new perspectives for this task. However, the absence of explicit cascade or infection probability data makes it particularly challenging to infer influence in hypergraphs. To address this, we introduce HIP, a unified and model-independent framework for influence prediction without knowing the underlying spreading model. HIP fuses multi-dimensional centrality indicators with a temporally reinterpreted distance matrix to effectively represent node-level diffusion capacity in the absence of observable spreading. These representations are further processed through a multi-hop Hypergraph Neural Network (HNN) to capture complex higher-order structural dependencies, while temporal correlations are modeled using a hybrid module that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Notably, HIP is inherently modular: substituting the standard HGNN with the advanced DPHGNN, and the LSTM with xLSTM, yields similarly strong performance, showcasing its architectural generality and robustness. Empirical evaluations across 14 real-world hypergraph datasets demonstrate that HIP consistently surpasses existing baselines in prediction accuracy, resilience, and identification of top influencers, all without relying on any diffusion trajectories or prior knowledge of the spreading model. These findings underline HIP's effectiveness and adaptability as a general-purpose solution for influence prediction in complex hypergraph environments.</description>
