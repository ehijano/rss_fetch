      <title>Interplay between Security, Privacy and Trust in 6G-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of 6G technology has the potential to revolutionize the transportation sector and significantly improve how we travel. 6G-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) promise to offer high-speed, low-latency communication and advanced data analytics capabilities, supporting the development of safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transportation solutions. However, various security and privacy challenges were identified in the literature that must be addressed to enable the safe and secure deployment of 6G-ITS and ensure people's trust in using these technologies. This paper reviews the opportunities and challenges of 6G-ITS, particularly focusing on trust, security, and privacy, with special attention to quantum technologies that both enhance security through quantum key distribution and introduce new vulnerabilities. It discusses the potential benefits of 6G technology in the transportation sector, including improved communication, device interoperability support, data analytic capabilities, and increased automation for different components, such as transportation management and communication systems. A taxonomy of different attack models in 6G-ITS is proposed, and a comparison of the security threats in 5G-ITS and 6G-ITS is provided, along with potential mitigating solutions. This research highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive, multi-layered security framework spanning physical infrastructure protection, network protocol security, data management safeguards, application security measures, and trust management systems to effectively mitigate emerging security and privacy risks and ensure the integrity and resilience of future transportation ecosystems.</description>

      <title>L4Span: Spanning Congestion Signaling over NextG Networks for Interactive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design for low latency networking is essential for tomorrow's interactive applications, but it is essential to deploy incrementally and universally at the network's last mile. While wired broadband ISPs are rolling out the leading queue occupancy signaling mechanisms, the cellular Radio Access Network (RAN), another important last mile to many users, lags behind these efforts. This paper proposes a new RAN design, L4Span, that abstracts the complexities of RAN queueing in a simple interface, thus tying the queue state of the RAN to end-to-end low-latency signaling all the way back to the content server. At millisecond-level timescales, L4Span predicts the RAN's queuing occupancy and performs ECN marking for both low-latency and classic flows. L4Span is lightweight, requiring minimal RAN modifications, and remains 3GPP and O-RAN compliant for maximum ease of deployment. We implement a prototype on the srsRAN open-source software in C++. Our evaluation compares the performance of low-latency as well as classic flows with or without the deployment of L4Span in various wireless channel conditions. Results show that L4Span reduces the one-way delay of both low-latency and classic flows by up to 98 %, while simultaneously maintaining near line-rate throughput. The code is available at https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/L4Span.</description>

      <title>FSMA: Scalable and Reliable LoRa for Non-Terrestrial Networks with Mobile Gateways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for universal IoT applications and the growing use of drones in emergency services, agriculture, and military operations highlight the transformative potential of non-terrestrial networks (NTN). However, these networks face two key challenges: (1) large coverage footprints that create frequent collisions and (2) moving gateways that cause dynamic links and demand synchronization-free, link-aware transmissions. Existing random access schemes such as ALOHA, CSMA, and BSMA fail in this setting, suffering from high collision rates, hidden terminals, or excessive gateway energy overhead. We propose Free Signal Multiple Access (FSMA), a gateway-controlled protocol that introduces a lightweight free signal chirp (FreeChirp). FreeChirp ensures that nodes transmit only when the channel is idle and when links are reliable, thereby reducing collisions and enabling link-aware access without the need for synchronization or complex scheduling. We evaluate FSMA using 25 commercial LoRa devices with a drone-mounted moving gateway and demonstrate up to 2x higher throughput, 2x to 5x better packet reception ratio, and 5x improved energy efficiency compared to the baselines. Large-scale simulations with a custom Satellite IoT Simulator further show that FSMA scales to 5000+ devices per satellite pass. These results establish FSMA as a practical step toward scalable, energy-efficient, and reliable NTN IoT networks.</description>

      <title>DH-EAC: Design of a Dynamic, Hierarchical Entanglement Access Control Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Dynamic, Hierarchical Entanglement Access Control (DH-EAC), a pure-quantum protocol for fair and anonymous allocation of scarce entanglement across wide-area quantum networks composed of many quantum LANs (QLANs). Prior Dicke-state-based pure-quantum MACs resolve contention by local measurements without classical signaling, but they mainly target a single QLAN under static conditions; extending them to wide-area, dynamic settings while avoiding post-selection reconciliation remains open. DH-EAC adopts a two-layer pure-quantum lottery: the outer layer selects winning QLANs and the inner layer selects winning nodes within each winning QLAN. A key design principle is that both the winning set and the per-QLAN quota are fixed by measurements alone, so the contention loop requires no classical round trip. The protocol thus aims to jointly satisfy anonymity (no node IDs revealed until decisions are fixed) and fairness (bias suppression under heterogeneous QLAN sizes). We also provide analytical models for success probability and latency under a standard i.i.d. loss model, and we evaluate DH-EAC against two baselines - single-layer Dicke within one QLAN and a classical GO-driven allocator - using a minimal, reproducible set of scenarios. Metrics include success probability, end-to-end latency, throughput, and Jain's fairness index. The results indicate that DH-EAC offers an implementable design point in the space of entanglement access control, balancing pure-quantum contention resolution, anonymity, and scalability for multi-QLAN networks.</description>

      <title>Sequence-Based Deep Learning for Handover Optimization in Dense Urban Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient handover management remains a critical challenge in dense urban cellular networks, where high cell density, user mobility, and diverse service demands increase the likelihood of unnecessary handovers and ping-pong effects. This paper leverages a real-world, multi-operator drive-test dataset of 30,925 labelled records collected within a 2 km area around Sunway City to investigate sequence-based deep learning approaches for handover detection and avoidance. We formulate handover prediction as a sequence problem and evaluate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer architectures under Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)-only and all-feature settings. The integration of multi-dimensional features significantly enhanced handover performance in dense urban cellular networks. The proposed GRU-based model achieved a remarkable 98% reduction in ping-pong handovers, alongside a 46.25% decrease in unnecessary handovers, outperforming the baseline RSRP-only approach which yielded a 22.19% reduction. Furthermore, the model demonstrated a 46% improvement in Time of Stay (ToS), indicating more stable user connections. With an inference time of just 0.91 seconds, the solution proves highly efficient and well-suited for real-time edge deployment scenarios. Compared to the conventional 3GPP A3 algorithm, these improvements demonstrate significant gains in mobility robustness and user Quality of Experience (QoE) improvement. The dataset is released to foster reproducibility and further research in intelligent mobility management for 5G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Digital Twins for Network Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased use of software in the operation and management of telecommunication networks has moved the industry one step closer to realizing autonomous network operation. One consequence of this shift is the significantly increased need for testing and validation before such software can be deployed. Complementing existing simulation or hardware-based approaches, digital twins present an environment to achieve this testing; however, they require significant time and human effort to configure and execute. This paper explores the automatic generation of digital twins to provide efficient and accurate validation tools, aligned to the ITU-T autonomous network architecture's experimentation subsystem. We present experimental results for an initial use case, demonstrating that the approach is feasible in automatically creating efficient digital twins with sufficient accuracy to be included as part of existing validation pipelines.</description>

      <title>NetCAS: Dynamic Cache and Backend Device Management in Networked Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern storage systems often combine fast cache with slower backend devices to accelerate I/O. As performance gaps narrow, concurrently accessing both devices, rather than relying solely on cache hits, can improve throughput. However, in data centers, remote backend storage accessed over networks suffers from unpredictable contention, complicating this split. We present NetCAS, a framework that dynamically splits I/O between cache and backend devices based on real-time network feedback and a precomputed Perf Profile. Unlike traditional hit-rate-based policies, NetCAS adapts split ratios to workload configuration and networking performance. NetCAS employs a low-overhead batched round-robin scheduler to enforce splits, avoiding per-request costs. It achieves up to 174% higher performance than traditional caching in remote storage environments and outperforms converging schemes like Orthus by up to 3.5X under fluctuating network conditions.</description>

      <title>TLoRa: Implementing TLS Over LoRa for Secure HTTP Communication in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TLoRa, an end-to-end architecture for HTTPS communication over LoRa by integrating TCP tunneling and a complete TLS 1.3 handshake. It enables a seamless and secure communication channel between WiFi-enabled end devices and the Internet over LoRa using an End Hub (EH) and a Net Relay (NR). The EH tethers a WiFi hotspot and a captive portal for user devices to connect and request URLs. The EH forwards the requested URLs to the NR using a secure tunnel over LoRa. The NR, which acts as a server-side proxy, receives and resolves the request from the Internet-based server. It then relays back the encrypted response from the server over the same secure tunnel. TLoRa operates in three phases -session setup, secure tunneling, and rendering. In the first phase, it manages the TCP socket and initiates the TLS handshake. In the second, it creates a secure tunnel and transfers encrypted TLS data over LoRa. Finally, it delivers the URL content to the user. TLoRa also implements a lightweight TLS record reassembly layer and a queuing mechanism for session multiplexing. We evaluate TLoRa on real hardware using multiple accesses to a web API. Results indicate that it provides a practical solution by successfully establishing a TLS session over LoRa in 9.9 seconds and takes 3.58 seconds to fulfill API requests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively design, implement, and evaluate the performance of HTTPS access over LoRa using full TLS.</description>

      <title>SoK: Preconfirmations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant research efforts have focused on improving blockchain throughput and confirmation speeds without compromising security. While decreasing the time it takes for a transaction to be included in the blockchain ledger enhances user experience, a fundamental delay still remains between when a transaction is issued by a user and when its inclusion is confirmed in the blockchain ledger. This delay limits user experience gains through the confirmation uncertainty it brings for users. This inherent delay in conventional blockchain protocols has led to the emergence of preconfirmation protocols -- protocols that provide users with early guarantees of eventual transaction confirmation.
  This article presents a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on preconfirmations. We present the core terms and definitions needed to understand preconfirmations, outline a general framework for preconfirmation protocols, and explore the economics and risks of preconfirmations. Finally, we survey and apply our framework to several implementations of real-world preconfirmation protocols, bridging the gap between theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Corrosion Risk Estimation for Heritage Preservation: An Internet of Things and Machine Learning Approach Using Temperature and Humidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proactive preservation of steel structures at culturally significant heritage sites like the San Sebastian Basilica in the Philippines requires accurate corrosion forecasting. This study developed an Internet of Things hardware system connected with LoRa wireless communications to monitor heritage buildings with steel structures. From a three year dataset generated by the IoT system, we built a machine learning framework for predicting atmospheric corrosion rates using only temperature and relative humidity data. Deployed via a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures worldwide without requiring extensive sensor networks</description>

      <title>Virtualizing RAN: Science, Strategy, and Architecture of Software-Defined Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtualizing the Radio-Access Network (RAN) is increasingly viewed as an enabler of affordable 5G expansion and a stepping-stone toward AI-native 6G. Most discussions, however, still approach spectrum policy, cloud engineering and organizational practice as separate topics. This paper offers an integrated perspective spanning four pillars -- science, technology, business strategy and culture. A comparative U.S.\ case study illustrates how mid-band contiguity, complemented by selective mmWave capacity layers, can improve both coverage and churn when orchestrated through software-defined carrier aggregation. We derive analytic capacity and latency bounds for Split 7.2 $\times$ vRAN/O-RAN deployments, quantify the throughput penalty of end-to-end 256-bit encryption, and show how GPU/FPGA off-load plus digital-twin-driven automation keeps the hybrid-automatic-repeat request (HARQ) round-trip within a 0.5 ms budget. When these technical enablers are embedded in a physics-first delivery roadmap, average vRAN cycle time drops an order of magnitude -- even in the presence of cultural head-winds such as dual-ladder'' erosion. Three cybernetic templates -- the Clock-Hierarchy Law, Ashby's Requisite Variety and a delay-cost curve -- are then used to explain why silo-constrained automation can amplify, rather than absorb, integration debt. Looking forward, silicon-paced 6G evolution (9-12 month node shrinks, sub-THz joint communication-and-sensing, chiplet architectures and optical I/O) calls for a dual-resolution planning grid that couples five-year spectrum physics with six-month silicon sprints.'' The paper closes with balanced, action-oriented recommendations for operators, vendors and researchers on sub-THz fronthaul, AI-native security, energy-proportional accelerators and zero-touch assurance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical spaces are increasingly dense with networked devices, promising seamless coordination and ambient intelligence. Yet today, cloud-first architectures force all communication through wide-area networks regardless of physical proximity. We lack an abstraction for spatial networking: using physical spaces to create boundaries for private, robust, and low-latency communication. We introduce $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$, a programming model that realizes spatial networking using bigraphs to express both containment and connectivity, enabling policies to be scoped by physical boundaries, devices to be named by location, the instantiation of spatial services, and the composition of spaces while maintaining local autonomy. Bifr\"ost enables a new class of spatially-aware applications, where co-located devices communicate directly, physical barriers require explicit gateways, and local control bridges to global coordination.</description>

Abstract: We develop Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric to interconnect accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art torus-based ML data-centers with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant compute allocations by up to 66%, reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%, and minimize the blast radius of chip failures. We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate these performance benefits which translate to 1.72X improvement in training throughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our hardware testbed, Morphlux can replace a failed accelerator chip with a healthy one in 1.2 seconds.</description>

      <title>MobiLLM: An Agentic AI Framework for Closed-Loop Threat Mitigation in 6G Open RANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).</description>

      <title>Graph Theory Meets Federated Learning over Satellite Constellations: Spanning Aggregations, Network Formation, and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Fed-Span, a novel federated/distributed learning framework designed for low Earth orbit satellite constellations. Fed-Span aims to address critical challenges inherent to distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites, and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span leverages minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies to introduce spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive novel convergence bounds for Fed-Span, accommodating its key system characteristics and degrees of freedom (i.e., tunable parameters). Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span. We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods, with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency. These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed learning in satellite networks.</description>
