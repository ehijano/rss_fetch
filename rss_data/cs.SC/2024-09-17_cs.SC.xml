      <title>Towards Verified Polynomial Factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer algebra systems are really good at factoring polynomials, i.e. writing f as a product of irreducible factors. It is relatively easy to verify that we have a factorisation, but verifying that these factors are irreducible is a much harder problem. This paper reports work-in-progress to do such verification in Lean.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression with a Learned Concept Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for symbolic regression (SR), the task of searching for compact programmatic hypotheses that best explain a dataset. The problem is commonly solved using genetic algorithms; we show that we can enhance such methods by inducing a library of abstract textual concepts. Our algorithm, called LaSR, uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM) to discover and evolve concepts occurring in known high-performing hypotheses. We discover new hypotheses using a mix of standard evolutionary steps and LLM-guided steps (obtained through zero-shot LLM queries) conditioned on discovered concepts. Once discovered, hypotheses are used in a new round of concept abstraction and evolution. We validate LaSR on the Feynman equations, a popular SR benchmark, as well as a set of synthetic tasks. On these benchmarks, LaSR substantially outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art SR approaches based on deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we show that LaSR can be used to discover a novel and powerful scaling law for LLMs.</description>

      <title>First steps towards Computational Polynomials in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proof assistant Lean has support for abstract polynomials, but this is not necessarily the same as support for computations with polynomials. Lean is also a functional programming language, so it should be possible to implement computational polynomials in Lean. It turns out not to be as easy as the naive author thought.</description>
