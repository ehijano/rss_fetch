      <title>Generative Engine Optimization: How to Dominate AI Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2) dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent "big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the new generative search landscape.</description>

      <title>Envy-Free but Still Unfair: Envy-Freeness Up To One Item (EF-1) in Personalized Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envy-freeness and the relaxation to Envy-freeness up to one item (EF-1) have been used as fairness concepts in the economics, game theory, and social choice literatures since the 1960s, and have recently gained popularity within the recommendation systems communities. In this short position paper we will give an overview of envy-freeness and its use in economics and recommendation systems; and illustrate why envy is not appropriate to measure fairness for use in settings where personalization plays a role.</description>

      <title>Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality; and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality, generalization, and efficiency. Our code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/rkl71/MambaRec.</description>

      <title>CESRec: Constructing Pseudo Interactions for Sequential Recommendation via Conversational Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRS) have become essential in many real-world applications. However, existing SRS methods often rely on collaborative filtering signals and fail to capture real-time user preferences, while Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) excel at eliciting immediate interests through natural language interactions but neglect historical behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose CESRec, a novel framework that integrates the long-term preference modeling of SRS with the real-time preference elicitation of CRS. We introduce semantic-based pseudo interaction construction, which dynamically updates users'historical interaction sequences by analyzing conversational feedback, generating a pseudo-interaction sequence that seamlessly combines long-term and real-time preferences. Additionally, we reduce the impact of outliers in historical items that deviate from users'core preferences by proposing dual alignment outlier items masking, which identifies and masks such items using semantic-collaborative aligned representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CESRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by boosting strong SRS models, validating its effectiveness in integrating conversational feedback into SRS.</description>

      <title>We're Still Doing It (All) Wrong: Recommender Systems, Fifteen Years Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was "doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated. Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice.</description>

      <title>Boosting Data Utilization for Multilingual Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual dense retrieval aims to retrieve relevant documents across different languages based on a unified retriever model. The challenge lies in aligning representations of different languages in a shared vector space. The common practice is to fine-tune the dense retriever via contrastive learning, whose effectiveness highly relies on the quality of the negative sample and the efficacy of mini-batch data. Different from the existing studies that focus on developing sophisticated model architecture, we propose a method to boost data utilization for multilingual dense retrieval by obtaining high-quality hard negative samples and effective mini-batch data. The extensive experimental results on a multilingual retrieval benchmark, MIRACL, with 16 languages demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming several existing strong baselines.</description>

      <title>AskDoc -- Identifying Hidden Healthcare Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to understand the online Ask the Doctor services medical advice on internet platforms via AskDoc, a Reddit community that serves as a public AtD platform and study if platforms mirror existing hurdles and partiality in healthcare across various demographic groups. We downloaded data from January 2020 to May 2022 from AskDoc -- a subreddit, and created regular expressions to identify self-reported demographics (Gender, Race, and Age) from the posts, and performed statistical analysis to understand the interaction between peers and physicians with the posters. Half of the posts did not receive comments from peers or physicians. At least 90% of the people disclose their gender and age, and 80% of the people do not disclose their race. It was observed that the subreddit is dominated by adult (age group 20-39) white males. Some disparities were observed in the engagement between the users and the posters with certain demographics. Beyond the confines of clinics and hospitals, social media could bring patients and providers closer together, however, as observed, current physicians participation is low compared to posters.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Reliable Interpretation of Radio Regulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge, the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.</description>

      <title>PerFairX: Is There a Balance Between Fairness and Personality in Large Language Model Recommendations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has enabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based interactions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations. However, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a critical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring demographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens 10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups. Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive, user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Question-Answering Simulator through the Distillation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students, thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation: (1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDSim-05A9.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive Memory-Based Optimization for Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by integrating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into models, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy while mitigating factual errors and hallucinations. This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components. The source code is available \footnote{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Amber-B203/}.</description>

      <title>Stratified Expert Cloning for Retention-Aware Recommendation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User retention is critical in large-scale recommender systems, significantly influencing online platforms' long-term success. Existing methods typically focus on short-term engagement, neglecting the evolving dynamics of user behaviors over time. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, though promising for optimizing long-term rewards, face challenges like delayed credit assignment and sample inefficiency.
  We introduce Stratified Expert Cloning (SEC), an imitation learning framework that leverages abundant interaction data from high-retention users to learn robust policies. SEC incorporates: 1) multi-level expert stratification to model diverse retention behaviors; 2) adaptive expert selection to dynamically match users with appropriate policies based on their state and retention history; and 3) action entropy regularization to enhance recommendation diversity and policy generalization.
  Extensive offline evaluations and online A/B tests on major video platforms (Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite) with hundreds of millions of users validate SEC's effectiveness. Results show substantial improvements, achieving cumulative lifts of 0.098 percent and 0.122 percent in active days on the two platforms respectively, each translating into over 200,000 additional daily active users.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Position Bias in Modern Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the position bias in information retrieval, where models tend to overemphasize content at the beginning of passages while neglecting semantically relevant information that appears later. To analyze the extent and impact of position bias, we introduce a new evaluation framework consisting of two position-aware retrieval benchmarks (SQuAD-PosQ, FineWeb-PosQ) and an intuitive diagnostic metric, the Position Sensitivity Index (PSI), for quantifying position bias from a worst-case perspective. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across the full retrieval pipeline, including BM25, dense embedding models, ColBERT-style late-interaction models, and full-interaction reranker models. Our experiments show that when relevant information appears later in the passage, dense embedding models and ColBERT-style models suffer significant performance degradation (an average drop of 15.6%). In contrast, BM25 and reranker models demonstrate greater robustness to such positional variation. These findings provide practical insights into model sensitivity to the position of relevant information and offer guidance for building more position-robust retrieval systems. Code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/NovaSearch-Team/position-bias-in-IR.</description>

      <title>HiD-VAE: Interpretable Generative Recommendation via Hierarchical and Disentangled Semantic IDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement (i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-Driven Graph RAG for Legal Norms: A Structural, Temporal, and Deterministic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00039v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Conformers for Audio Fingerprinting and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformers have shown great results in speech processing due to their ability to capture both local and global interactions. In this work, we utilize a self-supervised contrastive learning framework to train conformer-based encoders that are capable of generating unique embeddings for small segments of audio, generalizing well to previously unseen data. We achieve state-of-the-art results for audio retrieval tasks while using only 3 seconds of audio to generate embeddings. Our models are almost completely immune to temporal misalignments and achieve state-of-the-art results in cases of other audio distortions such as noise, reverb or extreme temporal stretching. Code and models are made publicly available and the results are easy to reproduce as we train and test using popular and freely available datasets of different sizes.</description>
