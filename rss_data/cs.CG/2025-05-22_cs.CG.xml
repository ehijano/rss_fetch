      <title>Partial Domination in Some Geometric Intersection Graphs and Some Complexity Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\em Partial domination problem} is a generalization of the {\em minimum dominating set problem} on graphs. Here, instead of dominating all the nodes, one asks to dominate at least a fraction of the nodes of the given graph by choosing a minimum number of nodes. For any real number $\alpha\in(0,1]$, $\alpha$-partial domination problem can be proved to be NP-complete for general graphs. In this paper, we define the {\em maximum dominating $k$-set} of a graph, which is polynomially transformable to the partial domination problem. The existence of a graph class for which the minimum dominating set problem is polynomial-time solvable, whereas the partial dominating set problem is NP-hard, is shown. We also propose polynomial-time algorithms for the maximum dominating $k$-set problem for the unit and arbitrary interval graphs. The problem can also be solved in polynomial time for the intersection graphs of a set of 2D objects intersected by a straight line, where each object is an axis-parallel unit square, as well as in the case where each object is a unit disk. Our technique also works for axis-parallel unit-height rectangle intersection graphs, where a straight line intersects all the rectangles. Finally, a parametrized algorithm for the maximum dominating $k$-set problem in a disk graph where the input disks are intersected by a straight line is proposed; here the parameter is the ratio of the diameters of the largest and smallest input disks.</description>

      <title>NeCGS: Neural Compression for 3D Geometry Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NeCGS, the first neural compression paradigm, which can compress a geometry set encompassing thousands of detailed and diverse 3D mesh models by up to 900 times with high accuracy and preservation of detailed geometric structures. Specifically, we first propose TSDF-Def, a new implicit representation that is capable of \textbf{accurately} representing irregular 3D mesh models with various structures into regular 4D tensors of \textbf{uniform} and \textbf{compact} size, where 3D surfaces can be extracted through the deformable marching cubes. Then we construct a quantization-aware auto-decoder network architecture to regress these 4D tensors to explore the local geometric similarity within each shape and across different shapes for redundancy removal, resulting in more compact representations, including an embedded feature of a smaller size associated with each 3D model and a network parameter shared by all models. We finally encode the resulting features and network parameters into bitstreams through entropy coding. Besides, our NeCGS can handle the dynamic scenario well, where new 3D models are constantly added to a compressed set. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our NeCGS over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

      <title>Homotopy-Aware Multi-Agent Path Planning on Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01945v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient framework using Dynnikov coordinates for homotopy-aware multi-agent path planning in planar domains that may contain obstacles. We developed a method for generating multiple homotopically distinct solutions for the multi-agent path planning problem in planar domains by combining our framework with revised prioritized planning and proved its completeness under specific assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than a method without Dynnikov coordinates. We also confirmed experimentally that homotopy-aware planning contributes to avoiding locally optimal solutions when searching for low-cost trajectories for a swarm of agents in a continuous environment.</description>
