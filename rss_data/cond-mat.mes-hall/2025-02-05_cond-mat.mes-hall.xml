      <title>Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry by themselves eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.</description>

      <title>Resonance Raman Scattering and Anomalous Anti-Stokes Phenomena in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrSBr, a van der Waals material, stands out as an air-stable magnetic semiconductor with appealing intrinsic properties such as crystalline anisotropy, quasi-1D electronic characteristics, layer-dependent antiferromagnetism, and non-linear optical effects. In this study, we investigate the differences between the absorption and emission spectra, focusing on the origin of the emission peak near 1.7 eV observed in the photoluminescence spectrum of CrSBr. Our findings are corroborated by excitation-dependent Raman experiments. Additionally, we explore the anti-Stokes Raman spectra and observe an anomalously high anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio of up to 0.8, which varies significantly with excitation laser power and crystallographic orientation relative to the polarization of the scattered light. This ratio is notably higher than that observed in graphene ($\approx$ 0.1) and MoS$_2$ ($\approx$ 0.4), highlighting the unique vibrational and electronic interactions in CrSBr. Lastly, we examine stimulated Raman scattering and calculate the Raman gain in CrSBr, which attains a value of 1 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm/GW, nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that of previously studied three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the competition between the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions of two magnetic impurities in twisted bilayer graphene away from the magic angle. We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. Such a regime might be characterized by non-conventional spin order parameters such as quadrupole order.</description>

      <title>Valley Gapless Semiconductor: Models and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Non-Ohmic Drain Resistance of 2DFETs at Cryogenic Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact issue for two-dimensional (2D) materials-based field-effect transistors (FETs) has drawn enormous attention in recent years. Although ohmic behavior is achieved at room temperature, the drain current of 2DFETs shifts from ohmic to non-ohmic behavior at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the shift is attributed to the asymmetric current reduction at the metal-semiconductor contact at low temperature. Under low drain bias, carriers tunnel from the source to the channel but diffuse to the drain side due to the channel-to-drain barrier, resulting in the current suppression. By studying the property of ohmic metal-semiconductor contact at different temperatures, we analyzed the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and the dependence on metal-to-semiconductor barrier height. The work opens the semiconductor physics of 2D material contact at cryogenic temperature and the importance of contact metal selection in the development of 2DFET at cryogenic temperature.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a magnon-scattering reservoir with modal and temporal multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for exploiting the inherent nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to perform computational tasks. Recently, we presented the magnon-scattering reservoir, whose internal nodes are given by the fundamental wave-like excitations of ferromagnets called magnons. These excitations can be geometrically-quantized and, in response to an external stimulus, show transient nonlinear scattering dynamics that can be harnessed to perform memory and nonlinear transformation tasks. Here, we test a magnon-scattering reservoir in a single magnetic disk in the vortex state towards two key performance indicators for physical reservoir computing, the short-term memory and parity-check tasks. Using time-resolved Brillouin-light-scattering microscopy, we measure the evolution of the reservoir's spectral response to an input sequence consisting of random binary inputs encoded in microwave pulses with two distinct frequencies. Two different output spaces of the reservoir are defined, one based on the time-averaged frequency spectra and another based on temporal multiplexing. Our results demonstrate that the memory and nonlinear transformation capability do not depend on the chosen read-out scheme as long as the dimension of the output space is large enough to capture all nonlinear features provided by the magnon-magnon interactions. This further shows that solely the nonlinear magnons in the physical system, not the read-out, determine the reservoir's capacity.</description>

      <title>Spin filtration in a single-stranded antiferromagnetic helix with slowly varying disorder: Higher order electron hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores spin filtration in a helical magnetic system within a tight-binding framework, where neighboring magnetic moments are aligned antiparallel. The helix experiences a slowly-varying diagonal disorder, following a cosine form, which creates a finite energy mismatch between up and down spin channels. Unlike earlier studies that relied on external electric fields, this investigation demonstrates that disorder alone can achieve high spin filtration, even at low bias and high temperatures. Higher-order electron hopping in the helix leads to a non-uniform energy level distribution, facilitating favorable spin filtration, sometimes reaching $100\%$. The interplay between higher-order hopping and atypical disorder may enable selective spin transmission through various antiferromagnetic helices, potentially opening new avenues for functional elements.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interference on the surface of Bi$_{\mathbf{2}}$Se$_{\mathbf{3}}$ terminated (PbSe)$_{\mathbf 5}$(Bi$_{\mathbf 2}$Se$_{\mathbf 3}$)$_{\mathbf 6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of topological superconductors derived from $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$, $\mathrm{Cu}_x(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ is unique in its surface termination of a single quintuple layer (QL) of the topological insulator (TI) $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ on an ordinary insulator PbSe. Here, we report a combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) characterization of the cleaved surface of the parent compound $(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (PSBS). Interestingly, the potential disorder due to the random distribution of native defects is only $\Gamma \sim 4~\mathrm{meV}$, comparable to the smallest reported for TIs. Performing high-resolution quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) near the Fermi energy ($E-E_\mathrm{F} = -1~\mathrm{eV}$ to $0.6~\mathrm{eV}$) we reconstruct the dispersion relation of the dominant spectral feature and our $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations show that this surface feature originates from two bands with Rashba-like splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. Moreover, a small hexagonal distortion of the calculated Fermi surface is seen in the full momentum space distribution of the measured scattering data. Interestingly, the scattering pattern at lower energies transforms into a flower-like shape with suppressed intensity along the $\overline{\Gamma K}$ direction. However, this effect is not due to the forbidden backscattering in the spin-momentum locked surface state in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ but reflects the threefold symmetry of the scattering potential.</description>

      <title>Electrical probe of spin-spiral order in quantum spin Hall/spin-spiral magnet van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional spin-spiral magnets provide promising building blocks for van der Waals heterostructures due to their tunable spin textures and potential for novel functionalities for quantum devices. However, due to its vanishing magnetization and two-dimensional nature, it is challenging to detect the existence of its noncollinear magnetization. Here, we show that a van der Waals junction based on a spin-spiral magnet and a quantum spin Hall insulator enables obtaining signatures of noncollinear magnetization directly from electrical measurements. Our strategy exploits the sensitivity of helical states to local breaking of time-reversal symmetry, enabling the detection of local magnetic orders even in the absence of net magnetization. We show that the combination of spin-spiral order and nonmagnetic disorder gives rise to scattering in the helical channels that can be directly associated with the spiral exchange coupling and residual nonmagnetic disorder strength. Our results show how electrical transport measurement provides a method to detect spin-spiral magnets by leveraging helical states in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Automated tuning and characterization of a single-electron transistor charge sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated protocol for tuning single-electron transistors (SETs) or single-hole transistors (SHTs) to operate as precise charge sensors. Using minimal device-specific information, the protocol performs measurements to enable the selection and ranking of high-sensitivity operating points. It also characterizes key device parameters, such as dot radius and gate lever arms, through acquisition and analysis of Coulomb diamonds. Demonstration on an accumulation-mode silicon SET at 1.5 K highlights its potential in the 1-2 K range for "hot" spin qubits in scalable quantum computing systems. This approach significantly reduces the tuning time compared to manual methods, with future improvements aimed at faster runtimes and dynamic feedback for robustness to charge fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been hindered by the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we show that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry known as the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. Furthermore, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Tailored Light-Matter Coupling in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric structures can support low-absorption optical modes, which are attractive for engineering light-matter interactions with excitonic resonances in two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the coupling strength is often limited by the electromagnetic field being confined inside the dielectric, reducing spatial overlap with the active excitonic material. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for enhanced light-matter coupling by embedding excitonic tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) within dielectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), forming a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that optimizes the field overlap and alignment between excitons and optical waveguide modes. To tailor diffractive coupling between free-space light and the waveguide modes in the vdW heterostructure, we fabricate Fourier surfaces in the top hBN layer using thermal scanning-probe lithography and etching, producing sinusoidal topographic landscapes with nanometer precision. We observe the formation of exciton-polaritons with a Rabi splitting indicating that the system is at the onset of strong coupling. These results demonstrate the potential of Fourier-tailored vdW heterostructures for exploring advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson vortices at finite voltage bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of finite voltage bias on Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in topological Josephson junctions with a vortex lattice. The voltage drives vortices into steady motion, squeezing the CdGM spectrum due to quasi-relativistic dispersion. A finite voltage range allows well-defined states, but beyond a critical breakdown voltage, the states collapse to zero energy and become sharply localized, marking a dynamical transition. Additionally, finite bias modifies selection rules for CdGM state transitions. Notably, in the steady-state regime, the time-averaged current vanishes, revealing a novel interplay between vortex dynamics and quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond charge and spin dynamics in CoPt alloys</title>

Abstract: The use of advanced X-ray sources plays a key role in the study of dynamic processes in magnetically ordered materials. The progress in X-ray free electron lasers enables the direct and simultaneous observation of the femtosecond evolution of electron and spin systems through transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), respectively. Such experiments allow us to resolve the response seen in the population of the spin-split valence states upon optical excitation. Here, we utilize circularly polarized ultrashort soft X-ray pulses from the new helical afterburner undulator at the free-electron laser FLASH in Hamburg to study the femtosecond dynamics of a laser-excited CoPt alloy at the Co $L_{3}$ absorption edge. Despite employing a weaker electronic excitation level we find a comparable demagnetization for the Co $3d$-states in CoPt compared to previous measurements on CoPd. This is attributed to distinctly different orbital hybridization and spin-orbit coupling between $3d$ and $4d$ vs. $3d$ and $5d$ elements in the corresponding alloys and multilayers.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast laser synthesis of zeolites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research has demonstrated that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine-tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto- and picosecond timescales of silica polymerisation and depolymerisation, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an ultrafast laser synthesis technique capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light-matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively freezing structures at any stage of self-assembly. Using this approach, we traced the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser-synthesized TPA-silicate-1 zeolites, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the exciton polaron by serial femtosecond crystallography on single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outstanding opto-electronic properties of lead halide perovskites have been related to the formation of polarons. Nevertheless, the observation of the atomistic deformation brought about by one electron-hole pair in these materials has remained elusive. Here, we measure the diffraction patterns of single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots (QDs) with and without resonant excitation in the single exciton limit using serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). By reconstructing the 3D differential diffraction pattern, we observe small shifts of the Bragg peaks indicative of a crystal-wide deformation field. Building on DFT calculations, we show that these shifts are consistent with the lattice distortion induced by a delocalized electron and a localized hole, forming a mixed large/small exciton polaron. This result creates a clear picture of the polaronic deformation in CsPbBr$_3$ QDs, highlights the exceptional sensitivity of SFX to lattice distortions in few-nanometer crystallites, and establishes an experimental platform for future studies of electron-lattice interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological Tenfold Classification and the Entanglement of Two Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a constructive method utilizing the Cartan decomposition to characterize topological properties and their connection to two-qubit quantum entanglement, in the framework of the tenfold classification and Wootters' concurrence. This relationship is comprehensively established for the 2-qubit system through the antiunitary time reversal (TR) operator. The TR operator is shown to identify concurrence and differentiate between entangling and non-entangling operators. This distinction is of a topological nature, as the inclusion or exclusion of certain operators alters topological characteristics. Proofs are presented which demonstrate that the 2-qubit system can be described in the framework of the tenfold classification, unveiling aspects of the connection between entanglement and a geometrical phase. Topological features are obtained systematically by a mapping to a quantum graph, allowing for a direct computation of topological integers and of the 2-qubit equivalent of topological zero-modes. An additional perspective is provided regarding the extension of this new approach to condensed matter systems, illustrated through examples involving indistinguishable fermions and arrays of quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly $100\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>The Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in strain-induced ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical strain presents an effective control over symmetry-breaking phase transitions. In quantum paralelectric SrTiO3, strain can induce the ferroelectric transition via modification of local Ti potential landscape. However, brittle bulk materials can only withstand limited strain range (~0.1%). Taking advantage of nanoscopically-thin freestanding membranes, we demonstrated in-situ strain-induced reversible ferroelectric transition in a single freestanding SrTiO3 membranes. We measure the ferroelectric order by detecting the local anisotropy of the Ti 3d orbital using X-ray linear dichroism at the Ti-K pre-edge, while the strain is determined by X-ray diffraction. With reduced thickness, the SrTiO3 membranes remain elastic with &gt;1% tensile strain cycles. A robust displacive ferroelectricity appears beyond a temperature-dependent critical strain. Interestingly, we discover a crossover from a classical ferroelectric transition to a quantum regime at low temperatures, which enhances strain-induced ferroelectricity. Our results offer a new opportunities to strain engineer functional properties in low dimensional quantum materials and provide new insights into the role of the ferroelectric fluctuations in quantum paraelectric SrTiO3.</description>

Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting nontrivial Euler class, a multigap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to dc conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multiband invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Tailoring topological band properties of twisted double bilayer graphene: effects due to spin-orbit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our theoretical study unfolds the topological phase transitions (within bands of the Moir\'e super-lattice) in small angle twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) under the influence of external gate voltage and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for both AB-AB and AB-BA stacking configurations. Utilizing a low-energy continuum model, we investigate the band structure and perform a comprehensive topological characterization of the system by analysing the direct band gap closing as well as various Chern numbers. In the absence of SOC, the tDBLG exhibits characteristics of a valley Hall insulator. However, in the presence of SOC, we observe a transition to a quantum spin Hall insulator state and band topology emerges in the parameter spaces of non-topological regime without SOC. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis between untwisted double bilayer graphene and tDBLG to assess the impact of twisting on the system's properties. Our findings reveal the construction of topological phase diagrams that showcase distinct phases arising from changes in the twist angle compared to the untwisted case. These phase diagrams provide valuable insights into the diverse topological phases achievable in tDBLG with SOC. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the interplay between small twist angle, SOC, and external electric field on the topological band properties of twisted multilayer graphene systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a chain of divalent atoms with two electronic orbitals per atom, whose length is periodically oscillating with time in response to an external oscillating pressure source. We introduce both inter-orbital and intra-orbital hopping between neighboring atoms which as a consequence of the oscillating lattice separation, are also periodically oscillating in time. Within the tight binding approximation and in the limit of very small inter-orbital hopping, we get two bands separated by an indirect band gap which itself oscillates due to the oscillating chain length. Under suitable choice of hopping parameters (about which it oscillates) and orbital energies, we show that there can be a periodic metal-insulator transition in the half-filled system. If the frequency of the metal-insulator transition resonates with an externally applied alternating electric field, it can give rise to the phenomena of half-wave rectification wherein in one half of the cycle the system is metallic and conducting, where as in the other half of the cycle it is insulating and non-conducting. We also observe that the phenomena remains robust even in the presence of small to intermediate values of onsite electron-electron repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a magnetic field in Faraday geometry: a theoretical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive and innovative exploration of how the surface potential energy landscape influences meander formation. Using the Vicinal Cellular Automaton model, which distinguishes surface diffusion from adatom incorporation into the crystal, the research delves into various factors affecting surface pattern dynamics. By isolating the diffusion process within a defined energy potential, the study provides a detailed analysis of how changes in the potential energy well and the barrier at the top of the step contribute to meander formation. Remarkably, the results reveal that the mere presence of a potential well at the step's bottom is sufficient to induce meandering. The role of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier on formed meanders is further investigated, and a mechanism for meander formation is proposed to clarify this process. The derived relation successfully reflects the wavelength of the meandered patterns observed in the simulations, emphasizing its reliability. Overall, the results illustrate the crucial influence of the surface energy potential's shape in driving surface pattern formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a proximity effect between Dirac surface states of a topological insulator and the skyrmion phase of an insulating magnet. A single skyrmion results in the surface states having a chiral gapless mode confined to the perimeter of the skyrmion. For the lattice of skyrmions, the tunneling coupling between confined states leads to the formation of low energy bands delocalized across the whole system. We show that the structure of these bands can be investigated with the help of the phenomenological chiral network model with a kagome lattice geometry. While the network model by itself can be in a chiral Floquet phase unattainable without external periodic driving, we show how to use a procedure known as band reconstruction to obtain the low energy bands of the electrons on the surface of the topological insulator for which there is no external driving. We conclude that band reconstruction is essential for the broad class of network models recently introduced to describe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Mn$_{3}$Ge with a non-collinear Kagome structures present exciting prospects for exploring Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effects (AHE). Despite substantial progress in bulk systems, the synthesis of crystalline thin films directly on silicon with a hexagonal phase presents a particular challenge unless a buffer layer is employed. In this study, we report the synthesis of single phase c-plane oriented hexagonal Mn$_{3}$Ge(0001) films on Si(100) using pulsed laser deposition. Under suitable growth conditions, we obtain layer-by-layer films with atomically flat surfaces and interfaces. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy study reveals the detail surface atomic structures, where the surface Mn atoms spontaneously arrange into a Kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy (dI/dV) measurement on the atomically resolved Kagome surface show a minima in local density of states near the Fermi level, likely originated from the Weyl crossings near K points. Despite the nearly vanishing magnetization, magnetotransport measurements in 30 nm $Mn_{3}$Ge(0001) films show anomalous Hall resistivity up to 0.41 ($\mu\Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) at 2 K. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations shed further light on the existence of topological features and the band structures in Mn$_{3+x}$Ge$_{1-x}$ with increasing Mn concentration $x$. The anomalous Hall response at room temperature in crystalline Mn$_{3}$Ge films on Si(100) offer promising potential for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Electric Drive in Silicon Quantum Dots with Electric Quadrupole Spin Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation with electron spin qubits requires coherent and efficient manipulation of these spins, typically accomplished through the application of alternating magnetic or electric fields for electron spin resonance (ESR). In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a new method of electric spin qubit control which generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance (EQSR). In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement distribution in a topological photonic network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain, that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand, providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating entanglement measures and witnesses proving that bipartite and multipartite entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards its ground state. In this work, we develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations for the examples of a 1d transverse-field Ising model, the transverse-field Ising model with an additional integrability-breaking field, and a non-integrable antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder. In all cases we are able to efficiently cool into the many-body ground state. The effects of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, are investigated through the lens of the kinetic theory: we show how the steady state quasiparticle populations depend on the noise rate, and we establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall Effect of Magnons from Many-Body Skew Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon interactions in thermal Hall physics.</description>

      <title>Protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that protons show an affinity to the air-water interface, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of the hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and towards the interior layers. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals local polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect driven by spin-charge-coupled motive force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquids in noise magnetormetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.</description>
