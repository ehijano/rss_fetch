      <title>Computing the bridge length: the key ingredient in a continuous isometry classification of periodic point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental model of any periodic crystal is a periodic set of points at all atomic centres. Since crystal structures are determined in a rigid form, their strongest equivalence is rigid motion (composition of translations and rotations) or isometry (also including reflections). The recent isometry classification of periodic point sets used a complete invariant isoset whose size essentially depends on the bridge length, defined as the minimum `jump' that suffices to connect any points in the given set.
  We propose a practical algorithm to compute the bridge length of any periodic point set given by a motif of points in a periodically translated unit cell. The algorithm has been tested on a large crystal dataset and is required for an efficient continuous classification of all periodic crystals. The exact computation of the bridge length is a key step to realising the inverse design of materials from new invariant values.</description>

      <title>Enhancing binary classification: A new stacking method via leveraging computational geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking, a potent ensemble learning method, leverages a meta-model to harness the strengths of multiple base models, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. Traditional stacking techniques typically utilize established learning models, such as logistic regression, as the meta-model. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates computational geometry techniques, specifically solving the maximum weighted rectangle problem, to develop a new meta-model for binary classification. Our method is evaluated on multiple open datasets, with statistical analysis showing its stability and demonstrating improvements in accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art stacking methods with out-of-fold predictions. This new stacking method also boasts two significant advantages: enhanced interpretability and the elimination of hyperparameter tuning for the meta-model, thus increasing its practicality. These merits make our method highly applicable not only in stacking ensemble learning but also in various real-world applications, such as hospital health evaluation scoring and bank credit scoring systems, offering a fresh evaluation perspective.</description>

      <title>NASM: Neural Anisotropic Surface Meshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new learning-based method, NASM, for anisotropic surface meshing. Our key idea is to propose a graph neural network to embed an input mesh into a high-dimensional (high-d) Euclidean embedding space to preserve curvature-based anisotropic metric by using a dot product loss between high-d edge vectors. This can dramatically reduce the computational time and increase the scalability. Then, we propose a novel feature-sensitive remeshing on the generated high-d embedding to automatically capture sharp geometric features. We define a high-d normal metric, and then derive an automatic differentiation on a high-d centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) optimization with the normal metric to simultaneously preserve geometric features and curvature anisotropy that exhibit in the original 3D shapes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework and a large dataset are proposed to construct a high-d Euclidean embedding space for 3D anisotropic surface meshing. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art in anisotropic surface meshing on a large number of surface models from Thingi10K dataset as well as tested on extensive unseen 3D shapes from Multi-Garment Network dataset and FAUST human dataset.</description>

      <title>On a Geometric Interpretation Of the Subset Sum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $S \in \mathbb{N}^n$ and $T \in \mathbb{N}$, the Subset Sum Problem (SSP) $\exists^? x \in \{0,1\}^n $ such that $S^T\cdot x = T$ can be interpreted as the problem of deciding whether the intersection of the positive unit hypercube $Q_n = [0,1]^n$ with the hyperplane $S^T\cdot \left(x - \frac{S}{\|S\|^2 }\cdot T \right) = 0$ contains at least a vertex. In this paper, we give an algorithm of complexity $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{\epsilon}\cdot n^b \right)$, for some absolute constant $b$, which either proves that there are no vertices in a slab of thickness $\epsilon$ either finds a vertex in the slab of thickness $4\cdot \epsilon$. It is shown that any vertex $P$ in a slab of thickness $\epsilon$ meets $\left| \frac{S^T\cdot P}{T} - 1 \right| \leq \epsilon$, therefore making the proposed algorithm a FPTAS for the SSP. The results are then applied to the study of the so called Simultaneous Subset-Sum Problem (SSSP).</description>
