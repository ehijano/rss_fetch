      <title>Buchsbaumness of finite complement simplicial affine semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we classify all Buchsbaum simplicial affine semigroups whose complement in their (integer) rational polyhedral cone is finite. We show that such a semigroup is Buchsbaum if and only if its set of gaps is equal to its set of pseudo-Frobenius elements. Furthermore, we provide a complete structure of these affine semigroups. In the case of affine semigroups with maximal embedding dimension, we provide an explicit formula for the cardinality of the minimal presentation in terms of the number of extremal rays, the embedding dimension, and the genus. Finally, we observe that, unlike the complete intersection, Cohen-Macaulay, and Gorenstein properties, the Buchsbaum property is not preserved under gluing of affine semigroups.</description>

      <title>On approximately ideals: primary and 1-absorbing ideals in descriptive relator spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the approx.ideal W of the approx.commutative ring R with unity in a descriptive relator space, after introducing the approx. prime ideal in [], this work demonstrates some special properties of the approx.ideals-specifically, the approx.primary ideal, the approx.semi-primary ideal and the approx.1-absorbing primary ideal. A set of theorems related to these concepts is presented. Among them is this important result: If W is an approx.1-absorbing primary ideal, then r(W) is an approx.prime ideal of the approx. ring R. Furthermore, the relationship between these classes is studied: If W is an approx.prime ideal of R, then W is also an approx.primary ideal. Moreover, it turns out that this is an approx.1-absorbing primary ideal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $k \ge 2$ polynomials in $d \ge 1$ variables with coefficients in a field of characteristic $0$, such that no two are linearly dependent, we show that for any integer $r$ greater than $\max\left\{k {k-1 \choose 2}, 2\right\}$, the $r$-th powers of the polynomials are linearly independent.</description>

      <title>Blowups of hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Micali asserts that a Noetherian local ring is regular if and only if the Rees algebra of its maximal ideal is defined by an ideal of linear forms. In this case, this defining ideal may be realized as a determinantal ideal of generic height, and so the Rees ring is easily resolved by the Eagon-Northcott complex, providing a wealth of information. If $R$ is a non-regular local ring, it is interesting to ask how far the Rees ring of its maximal ideal strays from this form, and whether any homological data can be recovered. In this paper, we answer this question for hypersurface rings, and provide a minimal generating set for the defining ideal of the Rees ring. Furthermore, we determine the Cohen-Macaulayness of this algebra, along with several other invariants.</description>

      <title>Multicomplex Configurations: a case study in Gorenstein Liaison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate multicomplex configurations, a class of projective varieties constructed via specialization of the polarizations of Artinian monomial ideals. Building upon geometric polarization and geometric vertex decomposition, we establish conditions under which such configurations retain desirable algebraic properties. In particular, we show that, given suitable choices of linear forms for substitution, the resulting ideals admit Gr\"obner bases with prescribed initial ideals and are in the Gorenstein liaison class of a complete intersection.</description>

      <title>A ruled residue theorem for function fields of hyperelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study residually transcendental extensions of a valuation $v$ on a field $E$ to function fields of hyperelliptic curves over $E$. We show that $v$ has at most finitely many extensions to the function field of a hyperelliptic curve over $E$, for which the residue field extension is transcendental but not ruled, assuming that the residue characteristic of $v$ is either zero or greater than the degree of the hyperelliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Computability of Equivariant Gr\"obner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field, $\mathcal{X}$ be an infinite set (of indeterminates), and $\mathcal{G}$ be a group acting on $\mathcal{X}$. An ideal in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is called equivariant if it is invariant under the action of $\mathcal{G}$. We show Gr\"obner bases for equivariant ideals are computable are hence the equivariant ideal membership is decidable when $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{X}$ satisfies the Hilbert's basis property, that is, when every equivariant ideal in $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is finitely generated. Moreover, we give a sufficient condition for the undecidability of the equivariant ideal membership problem. This condition is satisfied by the most common examples not satisfying the Hilbert's basis property.</description>

      <title>Ulrich bundles on double coverings of projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixed a polarised variety $X$, we can ask if it admits Ulrich bundles and, in case, what is their minimal possible rank. In this thesis, after recalling general properties of Ulrich sheaves, we show that any finite covering of $\mathbb{P}^n$ that embeds as a divisor in a weighted projective space with weights $(1^{n+1},m)$ admits Ulrich sheaves, by using matrix factorisations. Among these varieties, we focus on double coverings of with $n\ge3$. Through Hartshorne--Serre correspondence, which we review along the way, we prove that the general such $X$ admits a rank $2$ Ulrich sheaf if and only if $n=3$ and $m=2,3,4$, and characterise the zero loci of their sections. Moreover, we construct generically smooth components of the expected dimension of their moduli spaces, analyse the action of the natural involution on them and the restriction of those bundles to low degree hypersurfaces. For $m=2,3$, we verify the existence of slope-stable Ulrich bundles of all the possible ranks.</description>

      <title>Irreducible integer-valued polynomials with prescribed minimal power that factors non-uniquely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the question up to which power an irreducible integer-valued polynomial that is not absolutely irreducible can factor uniquely. For example, for integer-valued polynomials over principal ideal domains with square-free denominator, already the third power has to factor non-uniquely or the element is absolutely irreducible. Recently, it has been shown that for any $N\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a discrete valuation domain $D$ and a polynomial $F\in\operatorname{Int}(D)$ such that the minimal $k$ for which $F^k$ factors non-uniquely is greater than $N$.
  In this paper, we show that, over principal ideal domains with infinitely many maximal ideals of finite index, the minimal power for which an irreducible but not absolutely irreducible element has to factor non-uniquely depends on the $p$-adic valuations of the denominator and cannot be bounded by a constant.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued. As an application of our formula, we recover Sombra's bound on the height of resultants, in the classical case.</description>

      <title>On the Rich Landscape of Complete Intersection Monomial Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to explore complete intersection monomial curves from a contemporary perspective. The main goal is to help readers understand the intricate connections within the field and its potential applications. The properties of any monomial curve singularity will be first reviewed, highlighting the interaction between combinatorial and algebraic properties. Next, we will revisit the two main characterizations of complete intersection monomial curves. One is based on deep algebraic properties given by Herzog and Kunz in 1971, while the other is based on a combinatorial approach given by Delorme in 1976. Our aim is to bridge the gap between these perspectives present in the current literature. Then, we will focus on recent advances that show an intriguing connection between numerical semigroups and Alexander polynomials of knots. Finally, we will revisit the deformation theory of these curves and provide an answer to a question posed by Buchweitz and Greuel regarding curve deformations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a ring invariant which is closely related to the Davenport constant of a group. In particular, we will calculate this invariant for a certain class of rings of integers and their orders and use it to understand factorization properties of the latter. To this end, we also examine the well-behaved class of Galois-invariant orders.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of ideals of minors over some local rings and under deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(R,\mathfrak{m},\mathsf{k})$ be either a fiber product or an artinian stretched Gorenstein ring, with $\operatorname{char} (\mathsf{k})\neq 2$ in the latter case. We prove that the ideals of minors of a minimal free resolution of any finitely generated $R$-module are eventually 2-periodic. Moreover, if the embedding dimension of $R$ is at least 3, eventually the ideals of minors become the powers of the maximal ideal, yielding the 1-periodicity. Moreover, if the embedding dimension of $R$ is at least 3, these ideals of minors are eventually 1-periodic. These are analogs of results obtained over complete intersections and Golod rings by Brown, Dao, and Sridhar. We also prove that the eventual periodicity of ideals of minors can be lifted from $R$ to $R[[x]]$ for all finitely generated modules over $R$. More generally, we prove that for any local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m})$, the property of the asymptotic behaviour of ideals of minors being periodic can be lifted from $R/(x)$ to $R$ whenever $x \in \mathfrak{m}$ is a super-regular element for certain classes of modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with a relationship regarding the closedness of the singular locus of a Noetherian scheme and existence of classical generators in its category of coherent sheaves, associated bounded derived category, and singularity category. Particularly, we extend an observation initially made by Iyengar and Takahashi in the affine context to the global setting. Furthermore, we furnish an example a Noetherian scheme whose bounded derived category admits a classical generator, yet not every finite scheme over it exhibits the same property.</description>
