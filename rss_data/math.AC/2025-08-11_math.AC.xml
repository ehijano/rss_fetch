      <title>Andr\'e-Quillen homology and ascent of complete intersection flat dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Andr\'{e}-Quillen homology, we prove an ascent result for different types of complete intersection flat dimensions along an essentially of finite type flat local homomorphism with complete intersection closed fiber. As an application of our result, we extend a result of Majadas Soto and of Avramov, Henriques and \c{S}ega on the Andr\'{e}-Quillen dimension of surjective local homomorphisms to that of essentially of finite types.</description>

      <title>The Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, Chevalley-Warning Theorem and weak Finitesatz in skew polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study zeros of polynomials in the multivariate skew polynomial ring $D[x_1,\ldots,x_n; \sigma]$, where $\sigma$ is an automorphism of a division ring $D$. We prove a generalization of Alon's celebrated Combinatorial Nullstellensatz for such polynomials. In the case where $D$ is a finite field, we prove skew analogues of the Chevalley--Warning theorem, Ax's Lemma, and the weak case of Terjanian's Finitesatz.</description>

      <title>Joint reductions and mixed Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicities of modules and a joint-reduction-number-zero theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer new definitions of joint reductions and mixed Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity for certain collections of modules over a Noetherian local ring and illustrate their application to give two different proofs of a joint-reduction-number-zero theorem for integrally closed modules over two-dimensional regular local rings. We also relate the mixed Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity of modules to the Euler-Poincar\'{e} characteristic of a natural Koszul complex and relate it to the mixed Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity of ideals by generalising a lemma from intersection theory.</description>

      <title>Descent problem for certificate of non-negativity on semi-algebraic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a subfield of $\mathbb R$ and let $K$ be a basic closed semi-algebraic set in $\mathbb R$ with $\partial K\subset F$. Let $\mathcal N$ be the natural choice of generators of $K$. We show that if $f\in F[x]$ is $\geq 0$ on $K$, then $f$ can be written as $$f=\sum_{e\in\{0,1\}^s } a_e\sigma_e g^e $$ where $a_e\in F_{\geq 0}$, $\sigma_e\in \sum F[x]^2$ and $g^{e}=g_1^{e_1} \cdots g_s^{e_s}$. In other words, the preordering $T_{\mathcal N}$ of $F[x]$ is saturated. In case $F=\mathbb R$, this result is due to Kuhlmann and Marshall. As an application, we prove that if $K$ is compact, then $M_{\mathcal N}=T_{\mathcal N}=Pos(K)$. In other words, the quadratic module $M_{\mathcal N}$ of $F[x]$ is saturated.</description>

      <title>Computing almost commuting bases of ODOs and Gelfand-Dickey hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Almost commuting operators were introduced in 1985 by George Wilson to present generalizations of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy, nowadays known as Gelfand-Dickey (GD) hierarchies. In this paper, we review the formal construction of the vector space of almost commuting operators with a given ordinary differential operator (ODO), with the ultimate goal of obtaining a basis by computational routines, using the language of differential polynomials. We use Wilson's results on weighted ODOs to guarantee the solvability of the triangular system that allows to compute the homogeneous almost commuting operator of a given order in the ring of ODOs. As a consequence, the computation of the equations of the GD hierarchies is achieved without using pseudo-differential operators. A new package in SageMath called \texttt{dalgebra} has been designed to perform symbolic calculations in differential domains. The algorithms to calculate the almost commuting basis and the GD hierarchies in the ring of ODOs are implemented in SageMath, and explicit examples are provided.</description>

      <title>The v-numbers and linear presentations of ideals of covers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $J=I_c(G)$ be its ideal of covers. The aims of this work are to study the {\rm v}-number ${\rm v}(J)$ of $J$ and to study when $J$ is linearly presented using combinatorics and commutative algebra. We classify when ${\rm v}(J)$ attains its minimum and maximum possible values in terms of the vertex covers of the graph that satisfy the exchange property. If the cover ideal of a graph has a linear presentation, we express its v-number in terms of the covering number of the graph. If $G$ is unmixed, the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ is the graph whose vertices are the minimal vertex covers of $G$ and whose edges are the pairs $\{C,C'\}$ such that $|C\cup C'|=|C|+1$. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ to be connected. Then, for unmixed K\"onig graphs, we classify when $J$ is linearly presented using graph theory, and show some results on Cohen--Macaulay K\"onig graphs. If $G$ is unmixed, it is shown that the columns of the linear syzygy matrix of $J$ are linearly independent if and only if $\mathcal{G}_J$ has no strong $3$-cycles. One of our main theorems shows that if $G$ is unmixed and has no induced $4$-cycles, then $J$ is linearly presented. For unmixed graphs without $3$- and $5$-cycles, we classify combinatorially when $J$ is linearly presented.</description>

      <title>Computing Direct Sum Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and prove correctness of two practical algorithms for finding indecomposable summands of finitely generated modules over a finitely generated k-algebra R. The first algorithm applies in the (multi)graded case, which enables the computation of indecomposable summands of coherent sheaves on subvarieties of toric varieties (in particular, for varieties embedded in projective space); the second algorithm applies when R is local and k is a finite field, opening the door to computing decompositions in singularity theory. We also present multiple examples, including some which present previously unknown phenomena regarding the behavior of summands of Frobenius pushforwards (including in the non-graded case) and syzygies over Artinian rings.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Burch matrices and explicit torus-stable families of finite subschemes of $\mathbb A ^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Hilbert-Burch matrices, we give an explicit description of the Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cells on the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb A ^2$ with isolated fixed points. If the fixed point locus is positive dimensional we obtain an \'etale rational map to the cell. We prove Conjecture 4.2 from arXiv:2309.06871 which we realize as a special case of our construction. We also show examples when the construction provides a rational \'etale map to the Hilbert scheme which is not contained in any Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cell. Finally, we give an explicit description of the formal deformations of any ideal in the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme minimal cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). More generally, we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for this family of polynomials and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets. We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the first theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set.</description>
