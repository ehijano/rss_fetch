      <title>Non-Destructive Rail Monitoring for Defect Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of rail tracks is crucial to ensure the safety and reliability of rail transportation systems. In this work, we present a quantitative study using various signal processing methods to identify defects in rail structures. A diffuse field configuration was employed at few dozens of kiloHertz, where the emitter and receiver were remotely located, and wave energy propagated via multiple reflections within the medium. A reference database is first constructed by acquiring measurements at different rail positions and different torque levels (up to 50 N.m). The defect is then identified by comparing its signature to those stacked in the database. First, the destretching technique, based on Coda Wave Interferometry (CWI), is applied to correct for temperature-induced velocity variations. Then, the identification is performed using the Mean Square Error (MSE) metric and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) technique. A comparative analysis of the both methods is conducted, focusing on their robustness and performance.</description>

      <title>Universality of physical neural networks with multivariate nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently. In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints, detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying further efforts in their development.</description>

      <title>The Reciprocal Velocity Force of a Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reciprocal velocity force, $F(v)=\frac{C}{v}$, despite its theoretical and practical importance, is often neglected in mechanics courses. We use graphical methods to explain how such a force naturally arises from a device called a transmission, and discuss the kinematic consequences of this force. As an application, we discuss the role of this force for both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles.</description>
