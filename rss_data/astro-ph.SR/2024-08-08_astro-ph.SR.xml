      <title>Evolving massive stars to core collapse with GENEC: Extension of equation of state, opacities and effective nuclear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 solar masses will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron captures, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgrade the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it may cover the regime of high temperatures and high densities required to produce progenitors of core-collapse. We have improved GENEC in three directions, equation of state, the nuclear reaction network and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 15, 20 and 25 solar masses at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies impacting explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with potential for further dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>The Valuable Long-period Cluster Cepheid KQ Scorpii and other Calibration Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (L21 DR3 corrections applied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where consensus exists.</description>

      <title>A deeper investigation of the Primordial Binary Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We hereby reported a new physical binary cluster (ASCC~19 and ASCC~21) near the Orion star-forming complex based on the data in the literature. Analysis of the results shows that it is a primordial binary cluster. It is possible that this binary cluster is undergoing two-body relaxation by inspecting the radial velocity anomalies of its member stars. In addition, based on the analysis of its metal abundances, we found that the components of this binary cluster may have been formed by the deep fusion of multiple subclusters. Finally, we investigated the 3D morphology of this binary cluster, simulated the trajectories of its components in the galactic disk, and concluded that its components may not merge into a single cluster.</description>

      <title>Searching for magnetic fields in featureless white dwarfs with the DIPOL-UF polarimeter at the Nordic Optical Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 20% of the white dwarfs possess a magnetic field that may be detected by the splitting and/or polarization of their spectral lines. As they cool, the effective temperatures of the white dwarfs becomes so low that no spectral lines can be seen in the visible wavelength range. If their atmospheres are not polluted by the debris of a planetary system, these cool white dwarfs have featureless optical spectra. Until quite recently, very little was known about the incidence of magnetic fields in these objects. However, when observed with polarimetric techniques, a significant number of featureless white dwarfs reveal strong magnetic fields in their optical continuum spectra. Measuring the occurrence rate and strength of magnetic fields in old white dwarfs may help us to understand how these fields are generated and evolve. We report the results of an ongoing survey of cool white dwarfs with the high-precision broad-band polarimeter DIPOL-UF, which is deployed at the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, Spain. This survey has led to the firm discovery of 13 cool magnetic white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood so far, including six new detections that we report in this paper.</description>

      <title>Two successive EUV waves and a transverse oscillation of a quiescent prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength observations of two successive extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves originating from active region (AR) NOAA 13575 and a transverse oscillation of a columnar quiescent prominence on 2024 February 9. A hot channel eruption generates an X3.4 class flare and the associated full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME), which drives the first EUV wave front (WF1) at a speed of $\sim$835 km s$^{-1}$. WF1 propagates in the southeast direction and interacts with the prominence, causing an eastward displacement of the prominence immediately. Then, a second EUV wave front (WF2) is driven by a coronal jet at a speed of $\sim$831 km s$^{-1}$. WF2 follows WF1 and decelerates from $\sim$788 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim$603 km s$^{-1}$ before arriving at and touching the prominence. After reaching the maximum displacement, the prominence turns back and swings for 1$-$3 cycles. The transverse oscillation of horizontal polarization is most evident in 304 {\AA}. The initial displacement amplitude, velocity in the plane of the sky, period, and damping time fall in the ranges of 12$-$34 Mm, 65$-$143 km s$^{-1}$, 18$-$27 minutes, and 33$-$108 minutes, respectively. There are strong correlations among the initial amplitude, velocity, period, and height of the prominence. Surprisingly, the oscillation is also detected in 1600 {\AA}, which is totally in phase with that in 304 {\AA}.</description>

      <title>Formation of WNL stars for the MW and LMC based on the k-omega model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a set of second-order differential equations ($k-\omega$ model) to handle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of WNL stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and non-rotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting model. The results indicate that under the same initial conditions, the $k-\omega$ model generally produces larger convective cores and wider overshooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the lifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The masses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and initial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting schemes significantly differ in their impacts on lifetimes of the WNL stars, but insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the formation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect being more pronounced in the OV model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL stars formed during the MS phase is likely primarily from the CN-cycle, while it may come from both the CN- and NO-cycles for relatively metal-poor counterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars in the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars in the LMC.</description>

      <title>The $R$-Process Alliance: Fifth Data Release from the Search for $R$-Process-Enhanced Metal-poor Stars in the Galactic Halo with the GTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the abundance pattern of metal-poor stars and the production of heavy elements through various nucleosynthesis processes offers crucial insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, revealing primary sites and major sources of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) material in the Universe. In this fifth data release from the $R$-Process Alliance, we present the detailed chemical abundances of 41 faint (down to V = 15.8) and extremely metal-poor (down to [Fe/H] = -3.3) halo stars selected from the $R$-Process Alliance (RPA). We obtained high-resolution spectra for these objects with the HORuS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We measure the abundances of light, alpha, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We report the discovery of five CEMP, one limited-$r$, three $r$-I, and four $r$-II stars, and six Mg-poor stars. We also identify one star of a possible globular cluster origin at an extremely low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -3.0. This adds to the growing evidence of a lower limit metallicity floor for globular cluster abundances. We use the abundances of Fe-peak elements and the alpha-elements to investigate the contributions from different nucleosynthesis channels in the progenitor supernovae. We find the distribution of [Mg/Eu] as a function of [Fe/H] to have different enrichment levels, indicating different possible pathways and sites of their production. We also reveal differences in the trends of the neutron-capture element abundances of Sr, Ba, and Eu of various r-I and r-II stars from the RPA data releases, which provide constraints on their nucleosynthesis sites and subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Spectroscopic Characterization of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 19467 B with the NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the atmospheric characterization of the substellar companion HD 19467 B as part of the pioneering JWST GTO program to obtain moderate resolution spectra (R$\sim$2,700, 3-5$\mu$m) of a high-contrast companion with the NIRSpec IFU. HD 19467 B is an old, $\sim$9 Gyr, companion to a Solar-type star with multiple measured dynamical masses. The spectra show detections of CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O. We forward model the spectra using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and atmospheric model grids to constrain the effective temperature and surface gravity. We then use NEWERA-PHOENIX grids to constrain non-equilibrium chemistry parameterized by $K_{zz}$ and explore molecular abundance ratios of the detected molecules. We find an effective temperature of 1103 K, with a probable range from 1000--1200 K, a surface gravity of 4.50 dex, with a range of 4.14--5.00, and deep vertical mixing, log$_{10}$($K_{zz}$), of 5.03, with a range of 5.00--5.44. All molecular mixing ratios are approximately Solar, leading to a C/O $\sim$0.55, which is expected from a T5.5 brown dwarf. Finally, we calculate an updated dynamical mass of HD 19467 B using newly derived NIRCam astrometry which we find to be $71.6^{+5.3}_{-4.6} M_{\rm{Jup}}$, in agreement with the mass range we derive from evolutionary models, which we find to be 63-75 $M_{\rm{Jup}}$.These observations demonstrate the excellent capabilities of the NIRSpec IFU to achieve detailed spectral characterization of substellar companions at high-contrast close to bright host stars, in this case at a separation of $\sim$1.6\arcsec with a contrast of 10$^{-4}$ in the 3-5 $\mu$m range.</description>

      <title>V407 Lup, an intermediate polar nova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-ray and optical observations of nova V407 Lup (Nova Lup 2016), previously well monitored in outburst, as it returned to quiescent accretion. The X-ray light curve in 2020 February revealed a clear flux modulation with a stable period of 564.64$\pm$0.64 s, corresponding to the period measured in outburst and attributed to the spin of a magnetized white dwarf in an intermediate polar (IP) system. This detection in quiescence is consistent with the IP classification proposed after the nova eruption. The XMM-Newton EPIC X-ray flux is about 1.3 $\times 10^{-12}$ erg/cm$^2$/s at a distance, most likely, larger than 5 kpc, emitted in the whole 0.2-12 keV range without a significant cut-off energy. The X-ray spectra are complex; they can be fitted including a power law component with a relatively flat slope (a power law index of about 1), although, alternatively, a hard thermal component at kT$\geq$19 keV also yields a good fit. The SALT optical spectra obtained in 2019 March and 2022 May are quite typical of IPs, with strong emission lines, including some due to a high ionization potential, like He II at 4685.7 Angstrom. Nebular lines of O [III] were prominent in 2019 March, but their intensity and equivalent width appeared to be decreasing during that month, and they were no longer detectable in 2022, indicating that the nova ejecta dispersed. Complex profiles of the He II lines of V407 Lup are also characteristic of IPs, giving further evidence for this classification.</description>

      <title>Toroidal modified Miller-Turner CME model in EUHFORIA: II. Validation and comparison with flux rope and spheromak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rising concerns about the impact of space weather-related disruptions demand modelling and reliable forecasting of coronal mass ejection (CME) impacts. In this study, we demonstrate the application of the modified Miller-Turner (mMT) model implemented in EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA), to forecast the geo-effectiveness of observed coronal mass ejection (CME) events in the heliosphere. The goal is to develop a model that not only has a global geometry to improve overall forecasting but is also fast enough for operational space weather forecasting. We test the original full torus implementation and introduce a new three-fourth Torus version called the Horseshoe CME model. This new model has a more realistic CME geometry, and it overcomes the inaccuracies of the full torus geometry. We constrain the torus geometrical and magnetic field parameters using observed signatures of the CMEs before, during, and after the eruption. The assessment of the model's capability to predict the most important Bz component is performed using the advanced Dynamic Time Warping technique. The Horseshoe model prediction of CME arrival time and geo-effectiveness for both validation events compare well to the observations and are weighed with the results obtained with the spheromak and FRi3D models that were already available in EUHFORIA. The runtime of the Horseshoe model simulations is close to that of the spheromak model, which is suitable for operational space weather forecasting. Yet, the capability of the magnetic field prediction at 1~AU of the Horseshoe model is close to that of the FRi3D model. In addition, we demonstrate that the Horseshoe CME model can be used for simulating successive CMEs in EUHFORIA, overcoming a limitation of the FRi3D model.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-0845L: A low-mass M dwarf from the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Empirical Solar Energetic Particle Scaling Relations II. Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. The space radiation environment conditions and the maximum expected coronal mass ejection (CME) speed are being assessed through the investigation of scaling laws between the peak proton flux and fluence of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events with the speed of the CMEs. Methods. We utilize a complete catalog of SEP events, covering the last ~25 years of CME observations (i.e. 1997 to 2017). We calculate the peak proton fluxes and integrated event fluences for those events reaching an integral energy of up to E&gt; 100 MeV, covering the period of the last ~25 years of CME observations. For a sample of 38 strong SEP events, we first investigate the statistical relations between the recorded peak proton fluxes (IP) and fluences (FP) at a set of integral energies of E &gt;10 MeV, E&gt;30 MeV, E&gt;60 MeV, and E&gt;100 MeV versus the projected CME speed near the Sun (VCME) obtained by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO). Based on the inferred relations, we further calculate the integrated energy dependence of both IP and FP, assuming that they follow an inverse power-law with respect to energy. By making use of simple physical assumptions, we combine our derived scaling laws to estimate the upper limits for VCME, IP, and FP focusing on two cases of known extreme SEP events that occurred on February 23, 1956 (GLE05) and in AD774/775, respectively. Given physical constraints and assumptions, several options for the upper limit VCME, associated with these events, are investigated. Results. A scaling law relating IP and FP to the CME speed as V^{5}CME for CMEs ranging between ~3400-5400 km/s is consistent with values of FP inferred for the cosmogenic nuclide event of AD774/775. At the same time, the upper CME speed that the current Sun can provide possibly falls within an upper limit of VCME &lt;= 5500 km/s.</description>

      <title>Direct Method to Compute Doppler Beaming Factors in Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01033</link>

Abstract: The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13049419.</description>

      <title>The Dusty Aftermath of a Rapid Nova: V5579 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: V5579 Sgr was a fast nova discovered in 2008 April 18.784 UT. We present the optical spectroscopic observations of the nova observed from the Castanet Tolosan, SMARTS and CTIO observatories spanning over 2008 April 23 to 2015 May 11. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, typical of an Fe II class nova. The spectra show He I and He II lines along with forbidden lines from N, Ar, S, and O in the nebular phase. The nova showed a pronounced dust formation episode that began about 20 days after the outburst. The dust temperature and mass were estimated using the WISE data from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. The PAH-like features are also seen in the nova ejecta in the mid-IR Gemini spectra taken 522 d after the discovery. Analysis of the light curve indicates values of t$_2$ and t$_3$ about 9 and 13 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of fast nova. The best fit cloudy model of the early decline phase JHK spectra obtained on 2008 May 3 and the nebular optical spectrum obtained on 2011 June 2 shows a hot white dwarf source with T$_{BB}$ $\sim$ 2.6 $\times$ 10$^5$ K having a luminosity of 9.8 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our abundance analysis shows that the ejecta is significantly enhanced relative to solar, O/H = 32.2, C/H = 15.5 and N/H = 40.0 in the early decline phase and O/H = 5.8, He/H = 1.5 and N/H = 22.0 in the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>CHARA Near-Infrared Imaging of the Yellow Hypergiant Star $\rho$ Cassiopeiae: Convection Cells and Circumstellar Envelope</title>

Abstract: Massive evolved stars such as red supergiants and hypergiants are potential progenitors of Type II supernovae, and they are known for ejecting substantial amounts of matter, up to half their initial mass, during their final evolutionary phases. The rate and mechanism of this mass loss play a crucial role in determining their ultimate fate and the likelihood of their progression to supernovae. However, the exact mechanisms driving this mass ejection have long been a subject of research. Recent observations, such as the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, have suggested that the activity of large convective cells, combined with pulsation, could be a plausible explanation for such mass loss events. In this context, we conducted interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant, $\rho$ Cassiopeiae using the CHARA Array in H and K-band wavelengths. $\rho$ Cas is well known for its recurrent eruptions, characterized by periods of visual dimming ($\sim$1.5-2 mag) followed by recovery. From our observations, we derived the diameter of the limb-darkened disk and found that this star has a radius of $1.04\pm0.01$ milliarcseconds (mas), or $564 - 700 R_\odot$. We performed image reconstructions with three different image reconstruction software packages, and they unveiled the presence of giant hot and cold spots on the stellar surface. We interpret these prominent hot spots as giant convection cells, suggesting a possible connection to mass ejections from the star's envelope. Furthermore, we detected spectral CO emission lines in the K-band ($\lambda=2.31-2.38 \mu$m), and the image reconstructions in these spectral lines revealed an extended circumstellar envelope with a radius of $1.45\pm0.10$ mas.</description>

      <title>Exploring Systematic Errors in the Inferred Parameters of the Transiting Planet KELT-15b and its Host Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transiting planet systems offer a unique opportunity to measure the masses and radii of many planets and their host stars. Yet, relative photometry and radial velocity measurements alone only constrain the density of the host star. In remedy, the community uses theoretical and semi-empirical methods to break this one-parameter degeneracy and measure the mass and radius of the host star and its planet(s). We investigate the differences in the inferred system parameters due to modeling a host star with the Torres mass-radius relations, YY evolutionary tracks, MIST evolutionary tracks, and a stellar radius estimate from the spectral energy distribution (SED). We consider the effects of different priors on the stellar effective temperature, limb darkening, and eccentricity of the planet. Using the publicly available software package EXOFASTv2, we globally model TESS photometry and radial velocity observations of KELT-15, which hosts a fairly representative hot Jupiter. In total, we explore the impact of 28 different choices of priors on the inferred parameters of KELT-15b. We find broad agreement in the inferred system parameters across methodologies at the level of ~1.1 sigma between the MIST and SED constraints. This gives some confidence that systematic errors are not ubiquitous in transiting planets systems. We also find a ~2 sigma difference in the stellar radius estimated by the MIST models when we adopt differing literature spectroscopic effective temperature estimates. Similar studies of a large number of systems are needed to definitely assess systematic uncertainties the exoplanet population as a whole.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Thermal Transients from Supernova Interacting with a Circumstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of supernova ejecta with a surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM) generates a strong shock which can convert the ejecta kinetic energy into observable radiation. Given the diversity of potential CSM structures (arising from diverse mass loss processes such as late-stage stellar outbursts, binary interaction, and winds), the resulting transients can display a wide range of light curve morphologies. We provide a framework for classifying the transients arising from interaction with a spherical CSM shell. The light curves are decomposed into five consecutive phases, starting from the onset of interaction and extending through shock breakout and subsequent shock cooling. The relative prominence of each phase in the light curve is determined by two dimensionless quantities representing the CSM-to-ejecta mass ratio $\eta$, and a breakout parameter $\xi$. These two parameters define four light curve morphology classes, where each class is characterized by the location of shock breakout and the degree of deceleration as the shock sweeps up the CSM. We compile analytic scaling relations connecting the luminosity and duration of each light curve phase to the physical parameters. We then run a grid of radiation hydrodynamics simulations for a wide range of ejecta and CSM parameters to numerically explore the landscape of interaction light curves, and to calibrate and confirm the analytic scalings. We connect our theoretical framework to several case studies of observed transients, highlighting the relevance in explaining slow-rising and superluminous supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and double-peaked light curves.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method for multilevel NLTE radiative transfer problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calculation of the emerging radiation from a model atmosphere requires knowledge of the emissivity and absorption coefficients, which are proportional to the atomic level population densities of the levels involved in each transition. Due to the intricate interdependency of the radiation field and the physical state of the atoms, iterative methods are required in order to calculate the atomic level population densities. A variety of different methods have been proposed to solve this problem, which is known as the Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) problem.
  In this study we have developed a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method (JFNK) to solve multi-level NLTE radiative transfer problems. Using the Rybicki &amp; Hummer (1992) method as a reference (Rybicki, G. B. &amp; Hummer, D. G. 1992, A&amp;A, 262, 209), our results show that our JFNK solver can achieve up to a factor two speed up when using local approximate operators / preconditioners, while also achieving a lower residual error in the statistical equilibrium equations. Another advantage of this method is that the addition of charge conservation and partial redistribution effects should be straight forward.
  Our method can help accelerating the calculation of the emerging spectra from numerical models and also the reconstruction of chromospheric datasets through NLTE inversions.</description>
