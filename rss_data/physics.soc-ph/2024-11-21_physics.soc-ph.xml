      <title>Bringing together African &amp; European research communities with an inclusive astronomy conference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together the African and European academic astronomy communities. This conference aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international networking events (i.e., the typical experience of those affiliated with Western institutions), with those who have been historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge problems in the research field, but with a large focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diverse representation of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may have never attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Throughout this process maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment. We summarise some of the successes, challenges, and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants, which demonstrates an overall achievement of our objectives. This is all combined to provide some key recommendations for any groups, from any research field, who wishes to lead similar initiatives.</description>

      <title>Quantum versatility in PageRank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics empowers the emergence of quantum advantages in various fields, including quantum algorithms. Quantum PageRank is a promising tool for a future quantum internet. Recently, arbitrary phase rotations (APR) have been introduced in the underlying Szegedy's quantum walk of quantum PageRank algorithm. In this work, we thoroughly study the role APR plays in quantum PageRank. We discover the versatility resulting from quantumness. Specifically, we discover the emergence of a cluster phenomenon in rankings considering the rotation phases, i.e. the existence of similar clusters in the distribution of the rankings and their fidelity with the corresponding classical PageRanks, the ranking distribution variance, the coherence and entanglement of PageRank states, and the power law parameter in the ranking distributions on a scale-free network concerning the two rotation phases. Furthermore, we propose an alternate quantum PageRank with APR which provides an extra tunnel for the analysis of PageRank. We also study the PageRank on the trackback graph of a scale-free graph for the investigation of network information traffic tracking. We demonstrate the rich cluster diversity formed in our alternate quantum PageRank, which offers a novel perspective on the quantum versatility of PageRank. Our results present the quantum-enabled perspective for PageRanking and shed light on the design and application of practical quantum PageRank algorithms.</description>

      <title>Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Advancing Heatwave Forecasting via Distribution Informed-Graph Neural Networks (DI-GNNs): Integrating Extreme Value Theory with GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heatwaves, prolonged periods of extreme heat, have intensified in frequency and severity due to climate change, posing substantial risks to public health, ecosystems, and infrastructure. Despite advancements in Machine Learning (ML) modeling, accurate heatwave forecasting at weather scales (1--15 days) remains challenging due to the non-linear interactions between atmospheric drivers and the rarity of these extreme events. Traditional models relying on heuristic feature engineering often fail to generalize across diverse climates and capture the complexities of heatwave dynamics. This study introduces the Distribution-Informed Graph Neural Network (DI-GNN), a novel framework that integrates principles from Extreme Value Theory (EVT) into the graph neural network architecture. DI-GNN incorporates Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)-derived descriptors into the feature space, adjacency matrix, and loss function to enhance its sensitivity to rare heatwave occurrences. By prioritizing the tails of climatic distributions, DI-GNN addresses the limitations of existing methods, particularly in imbalanced datasets where traditional metrics like accuracy are misleading. Empirical evaluations using weather station data from British Columbia, Canada, demonstrate the superior performance of DI-GNN compared to baseline models. DI-GNN achieved significant improvements in balanced accuracy, recall, and precision, with high AUC and average precision scores, reflecting its robustness in distinguishing heatwave events.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Personal Networks of People Experiencing Homelessness in King County, WA with aggregate Relational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social networks of people experiencing homelessness are an understudied but vital aspect of their lives, offering access to information, support, and safety. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported 653,100 people experiencing homelessness on any given night -- a 23% rise since 2022, though likely an undercount. This paper examines a unique three-year dataset (2022-2024) of survey responses from over 3,000 unhoused individuals in King County, WA, collected via network-based sampling methods to estimate the unsheltered population. Our study analyzes the networks of the unsheltered population, focusing on acquaintance, close friendship, kinship, and peer referral networks. Findings reveal a decline in social connectivity over time. The average number of acquaintances dropped from 80 in 2023 to 40 in 2024. Close friendship levels remained stable at 2.5, but given the growth in the homeless population, this suggests decreased network connectivity. Kinship networks expanded, indicating that more family members of unhoused individuals are also experiencing homelessness. These trends suggest increasing social disconnection, possibly driven by displacement and a rise in newly homeless individuals. The growing isolation may reduce opportunities for information sharing and mutual support. However, the increased reliance on family networks highlights the shifting dynamics of social support within this community. This research underscores the need for policies fostering social connections and community building, such as reducing displacement and providing spaces for congregation, to counter the growing anomie among unhoused populations.</description>

      <title>The epidemiological footprint of contact structures in models with two levels of mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05287v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models with several levels of mixing (households, workplaces), as well as various corresponding formulations for R0, have been proposed in the literature. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of the distribution of the population size within social structures, effect that can help plan effective interventions. We focus on the influence on the model outcomes of teleworking strategies, consisting in reshaping the distribution of workplace sizes. We consider a stochastic SIR model with two levels of mixing, accounting for a uniformly mixing general population, each individual belonging also to a household and a workplace. The variance of the workplace size distribution appears to be a good proxy for the impact of this distribution on key outcomes of the epidemic, such as epidemic size and peak. In particular, our findings suggest that strategies where the proportion of individuals teleworking depends sublinearly on the size of the workplace outperform the strategy with linear dependence. Besides, one drawback of the model with multiple levels of mixing is its complexity, raising interest in a reduced model. We propose a homogeneously mixing SIR ODE-based model, whose infection rate is chosen as to observe the growth rate of the initial model. This reduced model yields a generally satisfying approximation of the epidemic. These results, robust to various changes in model structure, are very promising from the perspective of implementing effective strategies based on social distancing of specific contacts. Furthermore, they contribute to the effort of building relevant approximations of individual based models at intermediate scales.</description>

      <title>Death, Taxes, and Inequality. Can a Minimal Model Explain Real Economic Inequality?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Income inequality and redistribution policies are modeled with a minimal, endogenous model of a simple foraging economy. Significant income inequalities emerge from the model for populations of equally capable individuals presented with equal opportunities. Stochastic income distributions from the model are compared to empirical data from actual economies. The impacts of redistribution policies on total wealth, income distributions, and inequality are shown to be similar for the empirical data and the model. These comparisons enable detailed determinations of population welfare beyond what is possible with total wealth and inequality metrics. I</description>

      <title>The influence of active agent motility on SIRS epidemiological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Brownian disks moving in two dimensions that exchange information about their internal state stochastically are chosen to model epidemic spread in a self-propelled population of agents under the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) framework. The state of infection of an agent, or disk, governs its self-propulsion speed; consequently, the activity of the agents in the system varies in time. Two different protocols (one-to-one and one-to-many) are considered for the transmission of disease from the infected to susceptible populations. The effectiveness of the two protocols are practically identical at high values of the infection transmission rate. The one-to-many protocol, however, outperforms the one-to-one protocol at lower values of the infection transmission rate. Salient features of the macroscopic SIRS model are revisited, and compared to predictions from the agent-based model. Lastly, the motility induced phase separation in a population of such agents with a fluctuating fraction of active disks is found to be well-described by theories governing phase separation in a mixture of active and passive particles with a constant fraction of passive disks.</description>
