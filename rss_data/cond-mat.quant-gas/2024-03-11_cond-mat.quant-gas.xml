      <title>Quantum double structure in cold atom superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of topological quantum computation is underpinned by two important classes of models. One is based on non-abelian Chern-Simons theory, which yields the so-called $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ anyon models that often appear in the context of electrically charged quantum fluids. The physics of the other is captured by symmetry broken Yang-Mills theory in the absence of a Chern-Simons term, and results in the so-called quantum double models. Extensive resources have been invested into the search for $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ anyon quasi-particles; in particular the so-called Ising anyons ($k=2$) of which Majorana zero modes are believed to be an incarnation. In contrast to the $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ models, quantum doubles have attracted little attention in experiments despite their pivotal role in the theory of error correction. Beyond topological error correcting codes, the appearance of quantum doubles has been limited to contexts primarily within mathematical physics, and as such, they are of seemingly little relevance for the study of experimentally tangible systems. However, recent works suggest that quantum double anyons may be found in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. In light of this, the core purpose of this article is to provide a self-contained exposition of the quantum double structure, framed in the context of spinor condensates, by constructing explicitly the quantum doubles for various ground state symmetry groups and discuss their experimental realisability. We also derive analytically an equation for the quantum double Clebsch-Gordan coefficients from which the relevant braid matrices can be worked out. Finally, the existence of a particle-vortex duality is exposed and illuminated upon in this context.</description>

      <title>Exploring spin-squeezing in the Mott insulating regime: role of anisotropy, inhomogeneity and hole doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-squeezing in systems with single-particle control is a well-established resource of modern quantum technology. Applied in an optical lattice clock can reduce the statistical uncertainty of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we consider dynamic generation of spin-squeezing with ultra-cold bosonic atoms with two internal states loaded into an optical lattice in the strongly interacting regime as realized with state-of-the-art experiments using a quantum gas microscope. We show that anisotropic interactions and inhomogeneous magnetic fields generate scalable spin-squeezing if their magnitudes are sufficiently small, but not negligible. The effect of non-uniform filling caused by hole doping, non-zero temperature and external confinement is studied at a microscopic level demonstrating their limiting role in the dynamics and scaling of spin squeezing.</description>

      <title>Detecting degenerate bands topological invariants in optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel experimental approach for simulating and detecting topological invariants using ultracold fermions confined in two-dimensional hexagonal optical lattices. We propose achieving two-fold degenerate four-band models with non-trivial topologies in both the AII and A classes by introducing additional inertial forces, Raman processes, or periodic driving. By implementing various quench sequences and observing the evolution of the time-of-flight pattern, we can gather comprehensive information about the ground states and determine the topology of the valence bands. Through the analysis of tomographic results, we are able to extract and calculate the spin Chern number for both spin-conserving and spin-nonconserving cases. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the quantized topological invariants and discuss the effects of various experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Bond-Order Density Wave Phases in Dimerized Extended Bose-Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) has been widely explored to develop a profound understanding of the strongly correlated behavior of interacting bosons. Quantum simulators not only allow the exploration of the BHM but also extend it to models with interesting phenomena such as gapped phases with multiple orders and topological phases. In this work, an extended Bose-Hubbard model involving a dimerized one-dimensional model of long-range interacting hard-core bosons is studied. Bond-order density wave phases (BODW) are characterized in terms of their symmetry breaking and topological properties. At certain fillings, interactions combined with dimerized hoppings give rise to an emergent symmetry-breaking leading to BODW phases, which differs from the case of non-interacting models that require an explicit breaking of the symmetry. Specifically, the BODW phase at filling $\rho=1/3$ possesses no analogue in the non-interacting model in terms of its symmetry-breaking properties and the unit cell structure. Upon changing the dimerization pattern, the system realizes topologically trivial BODW phases. At filling $\rho=1/4$, on-site density modulations are shown to stabilize the topological BODW phase. Our work provides the bridge between interacting and non-interacting BODW phases and highlights the significance of long-range interactions in a dimerized lattice by showing unique BODW phases that do not exist in the non-interacting model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of hybrid quantum eigenstates in systems with mixed classical phasespace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems feature a structured, mixed classical phase-space. The traditional Percival classification of quantum spectra into regular states supported by quasi-integrable regions and irregular states supported by quasi-chaotic regions turns out to be insufficient to capture the richness of the Hilbert space. Berry's conjecture and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis are not applicable and quantum effects such as tunneling, scarring, and localization, do not obey the standard paradigms. We demonstrate these statements for a prototype Bose-Hubbard model. We highlight the hybridization of chaotic and regular regions from opposing perspectives of ergodicity and localization.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superfluidity from a particle-number-conserving perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate odd-in-time (or odd-frequency) pairing of fermions in equilibrium systems within the particle-number-conserving framework of Penrose, Onsager and Yang, where superfluid order is defined by macrosocopic eigenvalues of reduced density matrices. We show that odd-frequency pair correlations are synonymous with even fermion-exchange symmetry in a time-dependent correlation function that generalises the two-body reduced density matrix. Macroscopic even-under-fermion-exchange pairing is found to emerge from conventional Penrose-Onsager-Yang condensation in two-body or higher-order reduced density matrices through the symmetry-mixing properties of the Hamiltonian. We identify and characterise a transformer matrix responsible for producing macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations that coexist with a conventional Cooper-pair condensate, while a generator matrix is shown to be responsible for creating macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations from hidden orders such as a multi-particle condensate. The transformer scenario is illustrated using the spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid as an example. The generator scenario is demonstrated by the composite-boson condensate arising for itinerant electrons coupled to magnetic excitations. Structural analysis of the transformer and generator matrices is shown to provide general conditions for odd-frequency pairing order to arise in a given system.</description>

      <title>Topological transport of a classical droplet in a lattice of time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thouless charge pumps are quantum mechanical devices whose operation relies on topology. They provide the means for transporting quantum matter in space lattices with a single quantum precision. Contrasting space crystals that spontaneously break a continuous spatial translation symmetry and form crystals in space,time crystals have emerged as novel states of matter that organize into time lattices and spontaneously break a discrete time translation symmetry. The utility of Thouless pumps that enable topologically protected quantised transport of electrons and neutral atoms in spatial superlattices leads to the question if corresponding devices exist for time crystals? Here we show that topological pumps can be realized for time solids by transporting droplets of a liquid forward and backward in time lattices and we measure the topological index that characterises such pumping processes. By exploiting a synthetic time dimension classical time crystals can circumvent the quantum tunneling that underpins Thouless charge pumps. Our results establish topological pumping through time instead of space and pave the way for applications of time crystals.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence in long-range quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$ microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that in the canonical ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) setups are delineated.</description>

      <title>Reshaped Three-Body Interactions and the Observation of an Efimov State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efimov trimers are exotic three-body quantum states that emerge from the different types of three-body continua in the vicinity of two-atom Feshbach resonances. In particular, as the strength of the interaction is decreased to a critical point, an Efimov state merges into the atom-dimer threshold and eventually dissociates into an unbound atom-dimer pair. Here we explore the Efimov state in the vicinity of this critical point using coherent few-body spectroscopy in $^7$Li atoms using a narrow two-body Feshbach resonance. Contrary to the expectation, we find that the $^7$Li Efimov trimer does not immediately dissociate when passing the threshold, and survives as a metastable state embedded in the atom-dimer continuum. We identify this behavior with a universal phenomenon related to the emergence of a repulsive interaction in the atom-dimer channel which reshapes the three-body interactions in any system characterized by a narrow Feshbach resonance. Specifically, our results shed light on the nature of $^7$Li Efimov states and provide a path to understand various puzzling phenomena associated with them.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Hubbard-Thouless pumps through nonlocal fermionic repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thouless pumping represents a powerful concept to probe quantized topological invariants in quantum systems. We explore this mechanism in a generalized Rice-Mele Fermi-Hubbard model characterized by the presence of competing onsite and intersite interactions. Contrary to recent experimental and theoretical results, showing a breakdown of quantized pumping induced by the onsite repulsion, we prove that sufficiently large intersite interactions allow for an interaction-induced recovery of Thouless pumps. Our analysis further reveals that the occurrence of stable topological transport at large interactions is connected to the presence of a spontaneous bond-order-wave in the ground-state phase diagram of the model. Finally, we discuss a concrete experimental setup based on ultracold magnetic atoms in an optical lattice to realize the newly introduced Thouless pump. Our results provide a new mechanism to stabilize Thouless pumps in interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations of a Bose-condensed gas: Fate of second sound in the crossover regime between hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the moment method for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at finite temperatures that enable us to study collective sound modes from the hydrodynamic to the collisionless regime. In particular, we investigate collective excitations in a weakly interacting dilute Bose gas by applying the moment method to the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin equation, which is the coupled equation of the Boltzmann equation with the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Utilizing the moment method, collective excitations in the crossover regime between the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes are investigated in detail. In the crossover regime, the second sound mode loses the weight of the density response function because of the significant coupling with incoherent modes, whereas the first sound shows a distinct but broad peak structure. We compare the result obtained by the moment method with that of the Landau two-fluid equations and show that the collective mode predicted by the Landau two-fluid equations well coincides with the result from the moment method even far from the hydrodynamic regime, whereas clear distinction also emerges in the relatively higher momentum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite a long history of studies of vortex crystals in rotating superfluids, their melting due to quantum fluctuations is poorly understood. Here we develop a fracton-elasticity duality to investigate a two-dimensional vortex lattice within the fast rotation regime, where the Lifshitz model of the collective Tkachenko mode serves as the leading-order low-energy effective theory. We incorporate topological defects and discuss several quantum melting scenarios triggered by their proliferation. Furthermore, we lay the groundwork for a dual non-linear emergent gravity description of the superfluid vortex crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum vortices with more than a single circulation quantum are usually unstable and decay into clusters of smaller vortices. One way to prevent the decay is to place the vortex at the centre of a convergent (draining) fluid flow, which tends to force vortices together. It is found that whilst the primary splitting instability is suppressed in this way (and completely quenched for strong enough flows) a secondary instability can emerge in circular trapping geometries. This behaviour is related to an instability of rotating black holes when superradiantly amplified waves are confined inside a reflective cavity. The end state of the secondary instability is dramatic, manifesting as a shock wave that propagates round the circular wall and nucleates many more vortices.</description>

      <title>Signature of reentrant localization in collisional inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the localization transition in a spin-orbit (SO) coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with collisional inhomogeneous interaction trapped in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential. Our numerical analysis shows that the competition between the quasiperiodic disorder and inhomogeneous interaction leads to a reentrant localization transition as the interaction strength is tuned from attractive to repulsive in nature. Further, we analyse the combined effect of the SO and Rabi coupling strengths on the localization transition for different interaction strengths and obtain signatures of reentrant localization transition as function of SO coupling in the regime of weak interactions. We complement our numerical observation with the analytical model using the variational approach. At the end we show how the reentrant localization is manifested in the quench dynamics of the condensate. Our study provides an indirect approach to achieve localization transition without tuning the quasiperiodic potential strength, rather by tuning the inhomogeneous interaction.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of quasiperiodic and periodic onsite potentials in a Hatano-Nelson model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping. By considering a non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbour hopping and a quasiperiodic onsite potential under periodic boundary conditions, we show a breakdown of the typical correspondence between the delocalization-localization and complex-real transitions as a function of the potential strength. Moreover, we reveal that in the delocalized regime, when the potential strength increases, the eigenstates under open boundary conditions exhibit a bidirectional non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., they tend to localize on both the edges instead of localizing on either of the edges. However, when a periodic onsite potential is considered, the system not only exhibits a bidirectional skin effect but also shows a complete direction reversal of the skin effect as a function of the onsite periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transition of Operator Size Growth in Quantum Systems Embedded in an Environment</title>

Abstract: In closed generic many-body systems, unitary evolution disperses local quantum information into highly non-local objects, resulting in thermalization. Such a process is called information scrambling, whose swiftness is quantified by the operator size growth. However, for quantum systems embedded in an environment, how the couplings to the environment affect the process of information scrambling quests revelation. Here we predict a dynamical transition in quantum systems with all-to-all interactions accompanied by an environment, which separates two phases. In the dissipative phase, information scrambling halts as the operator size decays with time, while in the scrambling phase, dispersion of information persists and the operator size grows and saturates to an $O(N)$ value in the long-time limit with $N$ the number of degrees of freedom of the systems. The transition is driven by the competition between the system intrinsic and environment propelled scramblings and the environment induced dissipation. Our prediction is derived from a general argument based on epidemiological models and demonstrated analytically via solvable Brownian SYK models. We provide further evidence which suggests that the transition is generic to quantum chaotic systems when coupled to an environment. Our study sheds light on the fundamental behavior of quantum systems in the presence of an environment.</description>

      <title>Tunable tachyon mass in the PT-broken massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the full phase diagram of a non-Hermitian PT-symmetric generalization of the paradigmatic two-dimensional massive Thirring model. Employing the non-perturbative functional renormalization-group, we find that the model hosts a regime where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. This new phase is characterized by a relevant imaginary mass, corresponding to monstronic excitations displaying exponentially growing amplitudes for time-like intervals and tachyonic (Lieb-Robison-bound breaking, oscillatory) excitations for space-like intervals. Furthermore, since the phase manifests itself as an unconventional attractive spinodal fixed point, which is typically unreachable in finite real-life systems, we find that the effective renormalized mass reached can be tuned through the microscopic parameters of the model. Our results further predict that the new phase is robust to external gauge fields, contrary to the celebrated BKT phase in the PT unbroken sector. The gauge field then provides an effective and easy means to tune the renormalized imaginary mass through a wide range of values, and therefore the amplitude growth/oscillation rate of the corresponding excitations.</description>
