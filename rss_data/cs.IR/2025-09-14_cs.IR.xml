      <description>arXiv:2509.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the db3 team's winning solution for the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge 2025 at KDD Cup'25. Addressing the challenge's unique multi-modal, multi-turn question answering benchmark (CRAG-MM), we developed a comprehensive framework that integrates tailored retrieval pipelines for different tasks with a unified LLM-tuning approach for hallucination control. Our solution features (1) domain-specific retrieval pipelines handling image-indexed knowledge graphs, web sources, and multi-turn conversations; and (2) advanced refusal training using SFT, DPO, and RL. The system achieved 2nd place in Task 1, 2nd place in Task 2, and 1st place in Task 3, securing the grand prize for excellence in ego-centric queries through superior handling of first-person perspective challenges.</description>

      <title>Faster and Memory-Efficient Training of Sequential Recommendation Models for Large Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendations (SR) with transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in real-world applications, where SR models require frequent retraining to adapt to ever-changing user preferences. However, training transformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost associated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of items. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak memory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length. Recognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems typically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss with negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the final layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model performance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of negative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance, but rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb).
  In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient implementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates training by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10 times. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training, it becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item catalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss functions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related hyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these factors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and batch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To facilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that efficiently implements the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Clicks in Digital Advertising: Multimodal Inputs and Interpretable Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting click volume is a key task in digital advertising, influencing both revenue and campaign strategy. Traditional time series models rely solely on numerical data, often overlooking rich contextual information embedded in textual elements, such as keyword updates. We present a multimodal forecasting framework that combines click data with textual logs from real-world ad campaigns and generates human-interpretable explanations alongside numeric predictions. Reinforcement learning is used to improve comprehension of textual information and enhance fusion of modalities. Experiments on a large-scale industry dataset show that our method outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reasoning quality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces text-2-SQL-4-PM, a bilingual (Portuguese-English) benchmark dataset designed for the text-to-SQL task in the process mining domain. Text-to-SQL conversion facilitates natural language querying of databases, increasing accessibility for users without SQL expertise and productivity for those that are experts. The text-2-SQL-4-PM dataset is customized to address the unique challenges of process mining, including specialized vocabularies and single-table relational structures derived from event logs. The dataset comprises 1,655 natural language utterances, including human-generated paraphrases, 205 SQL statements, and ten qualifiers. Methods include manual curation by experts, professional translations, and a detailed annotation process to enable nuanced analyses of task complexity. Additionally, a baseline study using GPT-3.5 Turbo demonstrates the feasibility and utility of the dataset for text-to-SQL applications. The results show that text-2-SQL-4-PM supports evaluation of text-to-SQL implementations, offering broader applicability for semantic parsing and other natural language processing tasks.</description>

      <title>TalkPlayData 2: An Agentic Synthetic Data Pipeline for Multimodal Conversational Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In TalkPlayData 2 pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are open-sourced at https://talkpl.ai/talkplaydata2.html.</description>

      <title>GeoGPT.RAG Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GeoGPT is an open large language model system built to advance research in the geosciences. To enhance its domain-specific capabilities, we integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), which augments model outputs with relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge source. GeoGPT uses RAG to draw from the GeoGPT Library, a specialized corpus curated for geoscientific content, enabling it to generate accurate, context-specific answers. Users can also create personalized knowledge bases by uploading their own publication lists, allowing GeoGPT to retrieve and respond using user-provided materials. To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development. As part of this commitment, we have open-sourced two core RAG components-GeoEmbedding and GeoReranker-to support geoscientists, researchers, and professionals worldwide with powerful, accessible AI tools.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Narrative Pattern Discovery from Biomedical Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital libraries maintain extensive collections of knowledge and need to provide effective access paths for their users. For instance, PubPharm, the specialized information service for Pharmacy in Germany, provides and develops access paths to their underlying biomedical document collection. In brief, PubPharm supports traditional keyword-based search, search for chemical structures, as well as novel graph-based discovery workflows, e.g., listing or searching for interactions between different pharmaceutical entities. This paper introduces a new search functionality, called narrative pattern mining, allowing users to explore context-relevant entities and entity interactions. We performed interviews with five domain experts to verify the usefulness of our prototype.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Assistant for Long-Term Access to RHIC Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory concludes 25 years of operation, preserving not only its vast data holdings ($\sim$1 ExaByte) but also the embedded scientific knowledge becomes a critical priority. The RHIC Data and Analysis Preservation Plan (DAPP) introduces an AI-powered assistant system that provides natural language access to documentation, workflows, and software, with the aim of supporting reproducibility, education, and future discovery. Built upon Large Language Models using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and the Model Context Protocol, this assistant indexes structured and unstructured content from RHIC experiments and enables domain-adapted interaction. We report on the deployment, computational performance, ongoing multi-experiment integration, and architectural features designed for a sustainable and explainable long-term AI access. Our experience illustrates how modern AI/ML tools can transform the usability and discoverability of scientific legacy data.</description>

      <title>Personas within Parameters: Fine-Tuning Small Language Models with Low-Rank Adapters to Mimic User Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in developing accurate recommendation models is simulating user behavior, mainly due to the complex and stochastic nature of user interactions. Towards this, one promising line of work has been the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating user behavior. However, aligning these general-purpose large pre-trained models with user preferences necessitates: (i) effectively and continously parsing large-scale tabular user-item interaction data, (ii) overcoming pre-training-induced inductive biases to accurately learn user specific knowledge, and (iii) achieving the former two at scale for millions of users. While most previous works have focused on complex methods to prompt an LLM or fine-tune it on tabular interaction datasets, our approach shifts the focus to extracting robust textual user representations using a frozen LLM and simulating cost-effective, resource-efficient user agents powered by fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs). Further, we showcase a method for training multiple low-rank adapters for groups of users or \textit{persona}, striking an optimal balance between scalability and performance of user behavior agents. Our experiments provide compelling empirical evidence of the efficacy of our methods, demonstrating that user agents developed using our approach have the potential to bridge the gap between offline metrics and real-world performance of recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Powering Job Search at Scale: LLM-Enhanced Query Understanding in Job Matching Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query understanding is essential in modern relevance systems, where user queries are often short, ambiguous, and highly context-dependent. Traditional approaches often rely on multiple task-specific Named Entity Recognition models to extract structured facets as seen in job search applications. However, this fragmented architecture is brittle, expensive to maintain, and slow to adapt to evolving taxonomies and language patterns. In this paper, we introduce a unified query understanding framework powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), designed to address these limitations. Our approach jointly models the user query and contextual signals such as profile attributes to generate structured interpretations that drive more accurate and personalized recommendations. The framework improves relevance quality in online A/B testing while significantly reducing system complexity and operational overhead. The results demonstrate that our solution provides a scalable and adaptable foundation for query understanding in dynamic web applications.</description>

      <title>Wave-Based Semantic Memory with Resonance-Based Retrieval: A Phase-Aware Alternative to Vector Embedding Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional vector-based memory systems rely on cosine or inner product similarity within real-valued embedding spaces. While computationally efficient, such approaches are inherently phase-insensitive and limited in their ability to capture resonance phenomena crucial for meaning representation. We propose Wave-Based Semantic Memory, a novel framework that models knowledge as wave patterns $\psi(x) = A(x) e^{i\phi(x)}$ and retrieves it through resonance-based interference. This approach preserves both amplitude and phase information, enabling more expressive and robust semantic similarity. We demonstrate that resonance-based retrieval achieves higher discriminative power in cases where vector methods fail, including phase shifts, negations, and compositional queries. Our implementation, ResonanceDB, shows scalability to millions of patterns with millisecond latency, positioning wave-based memory as a viable alternative to vector stores for AGI-oriented reasoning and knowledge representation.</description>

      <title>A Research Vision for Web Search on Emerging Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We regularly encounter information on novel, emerging topics for which the body of knowledge is still evolving, which can be linked, for instance, to current events. A primary way to learn more about such topics is through web search. However, information on emerging topics is sparse and evolves dynamically as knowledge grows, making it uncertain and variable in quality and trustworthiness and prone to deliberate or accidental manipulation, misinformation, and bias. In this paper, we outline a research vision towards search systems and interfaces that support effective knowledge acquisition, awareness of the dynamic nature of topics, and responsible opinion formation among people searching the web for information on emerging topics. To realize this vision, we propose three overarching research questions, aimed at understanding the status quo, determining requirements of systems aligned with our vision, and building these systems. For each of the three questions, we highlight relevant literature, including pointers on how they could be addressed. Lastly, we discuss the challenges that will potentially arise in pursuing the proposed vision.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic post-hoc explainability for recommender systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems often benefit from complex feature embeddings and deep learning algorithms, which deliver sophisticated recommendations that enhance user experience, engagement, and revenue. However, these methods frequently reduce the interpretability and transparency of the system. In this research, we develop a systematic application, adaptation, and evaluation of deletion diagnostics in the recommender setting. The method compares the performance of a model to that of a similar model trained without a specific user or item, allowing us to quantify how that observation influences the recommender, either positively or negatively. To demonstrate its model-agnostic nature, the proposal is applied to both Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a widely used deep learning-based recommender, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a classical collaborative filtering technique. Experiments on the MovieLens and Amazon Reviews datasets provide insights into model behavior and highlight the generality of the approach across different recommendation paradigms.</description>

      <title>Diversified recommendations of cultural activities with personalized determinantal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While optimizing recommendation systems for user engagement is a well-established practice, effectively diversifying recommendations without negatively impacting core business metrics remains a significant industry challenge. In line with our initiative to broaden our audience's cultural practices, this study investigates using personalized Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to sample diverse and relevant recommendations. We rely on a well-known quality-diversity decomposition of the similarity kernel to give more weight to user preferences. In this paper, we present our implementations of the personalized DPP sampling, evaluate the trade-offs between relevance and diversity through both offline and online metrics, and give insights for practitioners on their use in a production environment. For the sake of reproducibility, we release the full code for our platform and experiments on GitHub.</description>

      <title>RecoWorld: Building Simulated Environments for Agentic Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RecoWorld, a blueprint for building simulated environments tailored to agentic recommender systems. Such environments give agents a proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where "user instructs, recommender responds," jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.</description>

      <title>MatSKRAFT: A framework for large-scale materials knowledge extraction from scientific tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly depends on synthesizing knowledge across vast literature, yet most experimental data remains trapped in semi-structured formats that resist systematic extraction and analysis. Here, we present MatSKRAFT, a computational framework that automatically extracts and integrates materials science knowledge from tabular data at unprecedented scale. Our approach transforms tables into graph-based representations processed by constraint-driven GNNs that encode scientific principles directly into model architecture. MatSKRAFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art large language models, achieving F1 scores of 88.68 for property extraction and 71.35 for composition extraction, while processing data $19$-$496\times$ faster than them (compared to the slowest and the fastest models, respectively) with modest hardware requirements. Applied to nearly 69,000 tables from more than 47,000 research publications, we construct a comprehensive database containing over 535,000 entries, including 104,000 compositions that expand coverage beyond major existing databases, pending manual validation. This systematic approach reveals previously overlooked materials with distinct property combinations and enables data-driven discovery of composition-property relationships forming the cornerstone of materials and scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable and Interpretable Document Question Answering via VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document understanding, particularly in identifying and extracting textual information from complex documents. Despite this, accurately localizing answers within documents remains a major challenge, limiting both interpretability and real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce \textit{DocExplainerV0}, a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that decouples answer generation from spatial localization. This design makes it applicable to existing VLMs, including proprietary systems where fine-tuning is not feasible. Through systematic evaluation, we provide quantitative insights into the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that correct answers often lack reliable localization. Our standardized framework highlights these shortcomings and establishes a benchmark for future research toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Effective Adaptation of Multimodal Foundation Models in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have revolutionized sequential recommender systems through advanced representation learning. While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/IISAN.</description>

      <title>InterFormer: Effective Heterogeneous Interaction Learning for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which predicts the probability of a user clicking an ad, is a fundamental task in recommender systems. The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.</description>

      <title>OMGM: Orchestrate Multiple Granularities and Modalities for Efficient Multimodal Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an effective approach for tackling Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), which requires external knowledge beyond the visual content presented in images. The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy Risks of LLM-Empowered Recommender Systems: An Inversion Attack Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65 percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87 percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.</description>

      <title>LMAR: Language Model Augmented Retriever for Domain-specific Knowledge Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with domain-specific knowledge due to performance deterioration of pre-trained embeddings and prohibitive computational costs of large language model (LLM)-based retrievers. While fine-tuning data augmentation embedding models offers a promising direction, its effectiveness is limited by the need for high-quality training data and reliable chunking strategies that preserve contextual integrity. We propose LMAR (Language Model Augmented Retriever), a model-agnostic framework that addresses these challenges by combining LLM-guided data synthesis with contrastive embedding adaptation and efficient text clustering. LMAR consists of a two-stage pipeline: (1) Triplet sampling and synthetic data augmentation, where LLMs act as both labeler and validator to ensure high-fidelity supervision throughout the pipeline. Experimental results across multiple domain-specific benchmark datasets demonstrate that LMAR outperforms multiple baseline models, while maintaining moderate hardware requirements and low latency. Its model-agnostic nature further enables seamless integration with emerging RAG architectures and text embedding models, ensuring continual improvements without redesigning the pipeline. These results highlight LMAR as a practical and cost-effective solution for scalable domain-specific adaptation.</description>

      <title>Are Multimodal Embeddings Truly Beneficial for Recommendation? A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research.</description>

Abstract: Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models. While these models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets, real-world applications demand domain-specific evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a specialized counterpart to MTEB designed for the financial domain. FinMTEB comprises 64 financial domain-specific embedding datasets across 7 tasks that cover diverse textual types in both Chinese and English, such as financial news articles, corporate annual reports, ESG reports, regulatory filings, and earnings call transcripts. We also develop a finance-adapted model, Fin-E5, using a persona-based data synthetic method to cover diverse financial embedding tasks for training. Through extensive evaluation of 15 embedding models, including Fin-E5, we show three key findings: (1) performance on general-purpose benchmarks shows limited correlation with financial domain tasks; (2) domain-adapted models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts; and (3) surprisingly, a simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach outperforms sophisticated dense embeddings in financial Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks, underscoring current limitations in dense embedding techniques. Our work establishes a robust evaluation framework for financial NLP applications and provides crucial insights for developing domain-specific embedding models.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Application-Specific TCP Congestion-Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Congestion Control (CC) module plays a critical role in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), ensuring the stability and efficiency of network data transmission. The CC approaches that are commonly used these days employ heuristics-based rules to adjust the sending rate. Due to their heuristics-based nature, these approaches are not only unable to adapt to changing network conditions but are also agnostic to the diverse requirements that different applications often have. Recently, several learning-based CC approaches have been proposed to adapt to changing network conditions. Unfortunately, they are not designed to take application requirements into account. Prior heuristics-based as well as learning-based CC approaches focus on achieving a singular objective, which is often to maximize throughput, even though a lot of applications care more about latency, packet losses, jitter, and different combinations of various network metrics. Motivated by this, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based CC framework, namely ASC, which allows any application to specify any arbitrary objectives that the network traffic of that application should achieve and is able to swiftly adapt to the changes in the objectives of the applications as well as to the changes in the network conditions. Our ASC framework further employs a client-server architecture that serves two purposes: 1) it makes ASC highly scalable in terms of the arrival and departure of TCP connections, and 2) it makes ASC very lightweight for the nodes maintaining the TCP connections. We implemented and extensively evaluated ASC in a variety of settings. Our results show that it can not only achieve various objectives but also outperforms prior approaches even in the specific objectives that those approaches were designed to achieve.</description>

      <title>A Topic Modeling Analysis of Stigma Dimensions, Social, and Related Behavioral Circumstances in Clinical Notes Among Patients with HIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral circumstances in people living with HIV(PLWHs) seeking care, using NLP methods applied to a large collection of EHR clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the southeast United States. Methods: We identified a cohort of PLWHs from the UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover stigma-related dimensions and related social and behavioral contexts. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to review notes for additional terms until saturation was reached iteratively. To identify more target topics, we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. The detected topics were evaluated using three widely used metrics and manually reviewed by specialists. In addition, we conducted word frequency analysis and topic variation analysis among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific demographics. Results: We identified 9140 PLWHs at UF Health and collected 2.9 million clinical notes. Through the iterative keyword approach, we generated a list of 91 keywords associated with HIV-related stigma. Topic modeling on sentences containing at least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes, such as "Mental Health Concern, Stigma", "Treatment Refusal, Isolation", and "Substance Abuse". Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed substantial differences. Conclusion: Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma and associated social and behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable, time-efficient assessment and overcoming the limitations of traditional questionnaires. Findings from this research provide actionable insights to inform patient care and interventions to improve HIV-care outcomes.</description>
