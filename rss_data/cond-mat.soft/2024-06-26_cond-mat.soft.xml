      <title>Quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain influenced by atomic charges in water model using orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17621v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently observed temperature-dependent quasiphase transition of the single-file water chain confined within a carbon nanotube in experiments has been validated by simple lattice theory and molecular dynamic simulations. It has been pointed out that atomic charges in water model is an important issue, yet how the values will affect the structural details and thermodynamic properties of the quasiphase transition has not been fully revealed. In this work, we performed orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble to explore the effect of atomic charges in SPC/E water model on the quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain. Based on the atomic charge values reported from literature, three distinct quasiphases are reproduced, comprising a fully hydrogen-bonded water chain at lower temperatures, a more ordered dipolar orientation along the x-axis at intermediate temperatures, and a completely disordered structure at higher temperatures. Then by increasing the atomic charge value, we find that the fragmentation of the entire water chain into shorter water segments, the orientational ordering of water dipoles, and the transition towards complete disorder are all inhibited. Consequently, the transition temperatures between three quasiphases have been shifted to higher temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the increased atomic charge values enhance the hydrogen bonding between neighbouring water molecules also the electrostatic attraction within the water chain, leading to a longer water dipole correlation length even at higher temperatures. These findings shed light on the vital role of atomic charges in water models and also the electrostatic interaction in regulating the orientational ordering of water molecules under nanoconfinement.</description>

      <title>Perovskite nanocrystal self-assemblies in 3D hollow templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly ordered nanocrystal (NC) assemblies, namely superlattices (SLs), have been investigated as novel building blocks of optical and optoelectronic devices due to their unique properties based on interactions among neighboring NCs. In particular, lead halide perovskite NC SLs have attracted significant attention, owing to their extraordinary optical characteristics of individual NCs and collective emission processes like superfluorescence (SF). So far, the primary method for preparing perovskite NC SLs has been the drying-mediated self-assembly method, in which the colloidal NCs spontaneously assemble into SLs during solvent evaporation. However, this method lacks controllability because NCs form random-sized SLs at random positions on the substrate rendering NC assemblies in conjunction with device structures such as photonic waveguides or microcavities challenging. Here, we demonstrate template-assisted self-assembly to deterministically place perovskite NC SLs and control their geometrical properties. A solution of CsPbBr3 NCs is drop-casted on a substrate with lithographically-defined hollow structures. After solvent evaporation and removal of excess NCs from the substrate surface, NCs only remain in the templates thereby defining the position and size of these NC assemblies. We performed photoluminescence (PL) measurements on these NC assemblies and observed signatures of SF, similar as in spontaneously assembled SLs. Our findings are crucial for optical devices that harness embedded perovskite NC assemblies and prepare fundamental studies on how these collective effects can be tailored through the SL geometry.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Induced Self-Organization of Autonomously Steering Microswimmers: Turbulence, Vortices, and Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of motile microorganisms exhibit a multitude of collective phenomena, including motility-induced phase separation and turbulence. Sensing of the environment and adaptation of movement plays an essential role in the emergent behavior. We study the collective motion of wet self-steering polar microswimmers, which align their propulsion direction hydrodynamically with that of their neighbors, by mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations. The simulations of the employed squirmer model reveal a distinct dependence on the swimmer flow field, i.e., pullers versus pushers. The collective motion of pushers is characterized by active turbulence, with nearly homogeneous density and a Gaussian velocity distribution. Pullers exhibit a strong tendency for clustering and display velocity and vorticity distributions with fat exponential tails; their dynamics is chaotic, with a temporal appearance of vortex rings and fluid jets. Our results show that the collective behavior of intelligent microswimmers is very diverse and still offers many surprises to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Disruption of the mitochondrial network in a mouse model of Huntington's disease visualized by in tissue multiscale 3D electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the coding sequence of the huntingtin protein. Initially, it predominantly affects medium-sized spiny neurons (MSSNs) of the corpus striatum. No effective treatment is available, thus urging the identification of potential therapeutic targets. While evidence of mitochondrial structural alterations in HD exists, previous studies mainly employed 2D approaches and were performed outside the strictly native brain context. In this study, we adopted a novel multiscale approach to conduct a comprehensive 3D in situ structural analysis of mitochondrial disturbances in a mouse model of HD.
  We investigated MSSNs within brain tissue under optimal structural conditions utilizing state-of-the-art 3D imaging technologies, specifically FIB/SEM for the complete imaging of neuronal somas and Electron Tomography for detailed morphological examination and image processing-based quantitative analysis. Our findings suggest a disruption of the mitochondrial network towards fragmentation in HD. The network of interlaced, slim, and long mitochondria observed in healthy conditions transforms into isolated, swollen, and short entities, with internal cristae disorganization, cavities, and abnormally large matrix granules.</description>

      <title>A microscopic approach to crystallization: challenging the classical/non-classical dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that a theoretical description of nucleation based on fluctuating hydrodynamics and classical density functional theory can be used to determine non-classical nucleation pathways for crystallization (Lutsko, Sci. Adv. 5, eaav7399 (2019)). The advantage of the approach is that it is free of any assumptions regarding order parameters and that requires no input other than molecular interaction potentials. We now extend this fundamental framework so as to describe the dynamics of non-classical nucleation. We use it to study the nucleation of both droplets and crystalline solids from a low-concentration solution of colloidal particles using two different interaction potentials. We find that the nucleation pathways of both droplets and crystals are remarkably similar at the early stages of nucleation until they diverge due to a rapid ordering along the solid pathways in line with the paradigm of "non-classical" crystallization. We compute the unstable modes at the critical clusters and find that despite the non-classical nature of solid nucleation, the size of the nucleating clusters remains the principle order parameter in all cases supporting a "classical" description of the {\it dynamics} of crystallization. We show that nucleation rates can be extracted from our formalism in a systematic way. Our results suggest that in some cases, despite the non-classical nature of the nucleation pathways, classical nucleation theory can give reasonable results for solids but that there are circumstances where it may fail. This contributes a nuanced perspective to recent experimental and simulation work suggesting that important aspects of crystal nucleation can be described within a classical framework.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Brownian particles under resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of an anisotropic particle subjected to different stochastic resetting schemes in two dimensions. The Brownian motion of shape-asymmetric particles in two dimensions results in anisotropic diffusion at short times, while the late-time transport is isotropic due to rotational diffusion. We show that the presence of orientational resetting promotes the anisotropy to late times. When the spatial (i.e. translational) degrees of freedom are reset, we find that a non-trivial spatial probability distribution emerges in the steady state that is determined by the initial orientation, particle asymmetry and the resetting rate. When only spatial degrees of freedom are reset while the orientational degree of freedom is allowed to evolve freely, the steady state is independent of the particle asymmetry. When only particle orientation is reset, the late-time probability density is given by a Gaussian with an effective diffusion tensor, including off-diagonal terms, determined by the resetting rate. Generally, the coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, when combined with stochastic resetting, gives rise to unique behaviour at late times not present in the case of symmetric particles. Considering recent developments in experimental implementations of resetting, our results can be useful for the control of asymmetric colloids, for example in self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for multi-physics modeling of poro-visco-hyperelasticity-induced time-dependent fracture of blood clots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracture resistance of blood clots plays a crucial role in physiological hemostasis and pathological thromboembolism. Although recent experimental and computational studies uncovered the poro-viscoelastic property of blood clots and its connection to the time-dependent deformation behavior, the effect of these time-dependent processes on clot fracture and the underlying time-dependent fracture mechanisms are not well understood. This work aims to formulate a thermodynamically consistent, multi-physics theoretical framework for describing the time-dependent deformation and fracture of blood clots. This theory concurrently couples fluid transport through porous fibrin networks, non-linear visco-hyperelastic deformation of the solid skeleton, solid/fluid interactions, mechanical degradation of tissues, gradient enhancement of energy, and protein unfolding of fibrin molecules. The constitutive relations of tissue constituents and the governing equation of fluid transport are derived within the framework of porous media theory by extending non-linear continuum thermodynamics at large strains. A physics-based, compressible network model is developed for the fibrin network of blood clots to describe its mechanical response. An energy-based damage model is developed to predict the damage and fracture of blood clots, and a transient non-local characterization length function is proposed to limit the damage zone bandwidth. The proposed model is experimentally validated using single-edge cracked clot specimens with different constituents. The fracture of blood clots subject to different loading conditions is simulated, and the mechanisms of clot fracture are systematically analyzed. Computational results show that the viscoelasticity and fluid transport play essential roles in the fracture of blood clots under physiological loading.</description>
