      <title>A Sharp Test for the Judge Leniency Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new specification test to assess the validity of the judge leniency design. We characterize a set of sharp testable implications, which exploit all the relevant information in the observed data distribution to detect violations of the judge leniency design assumptions. The proposed sharp test is asymptotically valid and consistent and will not make discordant recommendations. When the judge's leniency design assumptions are rejected, we propose a way to salvage the model using partial monotonicity and exclusion assumptions, under which a variant of the Local Instrumental Variable (LIV) estimand can recover the Marginal Treatment Effect. Simulation studies show our test outperforms existing non-sharp tests by significant margins. We apply our test to assess the validity of the judge leniency design using data from Stevenson (2018), and it rejects the validity for three crime categories: robbery, drug selling, and drug possession.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Sensitivity in Quantitative Trade and Spatial Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactuals in quantitative trade and spatial models are functions of the current state of the world and the model parameters. Common practice treats the current state of the world as perfectly observed, but there is good reason to believe that it is measured with error. This paper provides tools for quantifying uncertainty about counterfactuals when the current state of the world is measured with error. I recommend an empirical Bayes approach to uncertainty quantification, and show that it is both practical and theoretically justified. I apply the proposed method to the settings in Adao, Costinot, and Donaldson (2017) and Allen and Arkolakis (2022) and find non-trivial uncertainty about counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>
