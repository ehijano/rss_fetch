      <title>Spirals, rings, and vortices shaped by shadows in protoplanetary disks: from radiative hydrodynamical simulations to observable signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous protoplanetary disks exhibit shadows in scattered light observations. These shadows are typically cast by misaligned inner disks and are associated with observable structures in the outer disk such as bright arcs and spirals. Investigating the dynamics of the shadowed outer disk is therefore essential in understanding the formation and evolution of these structures. We carry out twodimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative diffusion and dust-gas dynamics to study the formation of substructure in shadowed disks. We find that spiral arms are launched at the edge of each shadow, permeating the entire disk. The local dissipation of these spirals results in an angular momentum flux, opening multiple gaps and leading to a series of concentric, regularly-spaced rings We find that ring formation is favored in weakly turbulent disks where dust growth is taking place. These conditions are met for typical class-II disks, in which bright rings should form well within a fraction of their lifetime (0.1-0.2 Myr). For hotter disks gap opening is more efficient, such that the gap edges quickly collapse into vortices that can appear as bright arcs in continuum emission before decaying into rings or merging into massive, long-lived structures. Synthetic observations show that these structures should be observable in scattered light and millimeter continuum emission, providing a new way to probe the presence of substructure in protoplanetary disks. Our results suggest that the formation of rings and gaps is a common process in shadowed disks, and can explain the rich radial substructure observed in several protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>HD 28185 Revisited: An Outer Planet, Instead of a Brown Dwarf, On a Saturn-like Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As exoplanet surveys reach ever-higher sensitivities and durations, planets analogous to the solar system giant planets are increasingly within reach. HD 28185 is a Sun-like star known to host a $m\sin i=6 M_J$ planet on an Earth-like orbit; more recently, a brown dwarf with a more distant orbit has been claimed. In this work we present a comprehensive reanalysis of the HD 28185 system, based on 22 years of radial velocity observations and precision Hipparcos-Gaia astrometry. We confirm the previous characterisation of HD 28185 b as a temperate giant planet, with its $385.92^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ day orbital period giving it an Earth-like incident flux. In contrast, we substantially revise the parameters of HD 28185 c; with a new mass of $m=6.0\pm0.6 M_J$ we reclassify this companion as a super-jovian planet. HD 28185 c has an orbital period of $24.9^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ years, a semi-major axis of $8.50^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$ AU, and a modest eccentricity of $0.15\pm0.04$, resulting in one of the most Saturn-like orbits of any known exoplanet. HD 28185 c lies at the current intersection of detection limits for RVs and direct imaging, and highlights how the discovery of giant planets at $\approx$10 AU separations is becoming increasingly routine.</description>

      <title>Planet Formation Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation encompasses processes that span a remarkable 40 magnitudes in mass, ranging from collisions between micron-sized grains inherit from the ISM to accretion of gas by giant planets. The planet formation process takes place in the interior of dusty disks, which offer us only limited observational constraints. Historically, the two main paradigms describing planet formation are the disk instability and core accretion models. In the former giant planets condense directly form a disk massive enough to fragments under its self-gravity. In contrast, the core accretion model follows a bottom-up approach driven by solids. This model includes the direct growth phase, where pebble and possibly planetesimal sized bodies form by surface-driven processes. Alternatively, planetesimal bodies can emerge from instabilities in the solid population, leading to the formation of clumps that ultimately collapse. The later growth phases of the core accretion model involve the creation of a protoplanet out of the planetesimal population, which then accrete smaller bodies|planetesimals or pebbles|before ultimately accreting freely the gas of the disk. In this Chapter I will review these formation mechanisms, aiming, where possible, to build an intuitive understanding from elementary physical principles.</description>

      <title>Sputter Yields of the Lunar Surface: Experimental Validation and Numerical Modelling of Solar Wind Sputtering of Apollo 16 Soils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sputtering by solar wind ions is a key process driving the ejection of high-energy particles into the exospheres of airless bodies like asteroids, Mercury and the Moon. In view of upcoming missions which will deliver new in-situ data on these exospheres like the Artemis program at the Moon and BepiColombo at Mercury, a deeper understanding of sputtering effects is crucial. In this work, we combine sensitive quartz crystal microbalance measurements and numerical simulations to quantify sputter yields of Apollo soil 68501 under solar wind relevant conditions. We find that none of the commonly used simulation codes can reliably predict laboratory sputter yields without experimental benchmarks. All of the employed packages significantly overestimate the sputter yields of flat samples by at least a factor of 2 for the case of hydrogen. When accounting for surface roughness and regolith-like porosity, sputter yields are decreased even further to 7.3E-3 atoms\ion and 7.6E-2 atoms\ion for H and He at solar wind energies of 1 keV\amu, respectively. The reduced yields of porous regolith structures are largely independent of the ion incidence angle, making them applicable across a wide range of lunar latitudes. This study highlights the need for experimental validation of sputtering models to ensure accurate predictions for space weathering and lunar exosphere composition.</description>

      <title>Kinematical signatures: Distinguishing between warps and radial flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing evidence shows that warped disks are common, challenging the methods used to model their velocity fields. Molecular line emission of these disks is characterized by a twisted pattern, similar to the signal from radial flows, complicating the study of warped disk kinematics. Previous attempts to model these features have encountered difficulties in distinguishing between the underlying kinematics of different disks. This study aims to advance gas kinematics modeling capabilities by extending the Extracting Disk Dynamics ($\texttt{eddy}$) package to include warped geometries and radial flows. We assess the performance of $\texttt{eddy}$ in recovering input parameters for scenarios involving warps, radial flows, and combinations of the two. Additionally, we provide a basis to break the visual degeneracy between warped disks and radial flow, establishing a criterion to distinguish them. We extended the $\texttt{eddy}$ package to handle warped geometries by including a parametric prescription of a warped disk and a ray-casting algorithm to account for the surface self-obscuration arising from the 3D to 2D projection. The effectiveness of the tool was tested using the radiative transfer code $\texttt{RADMC3D}$, generating synthetic models for disks with radial flows, warped disks, and warped disks with radial flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of our tool in accurately recovering the geometrical parameters of systems, particularly in data with sufficient angular resolution. Importantly, we observe minimal impact from thermal noise levels typical in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Furthermore, our findings reveal that fitting an incorrect model type produces characteristic residual signatures, which serve as kinematic criteria for disk classification.</description>

      <title>Existence of slowly rotating bipolytropes with prolate cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of hydrostatic equilibrium states for a composite body made of two rigidly rotating, homogeneous layers bounded by spheroidal surfaces, where the core has a prolate shape. These new configurations require an oblate envelope that spins faster than the core. No solution with a prolate envelope is found. For some parameters, the prolate core can even be at rest. Numerical experiments based on the self-consistent field method support this result in the case of heterogeneous layers with polytropic equations of state. The possible cancellation of the first gravitational moment, $J_2$, is discussed.</description>

      <title>A search for self-lensing binaries with TESS and constraints on their occurrence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five self-lensing binaries (SLBs) have been discovered with Kepler light curves. They contain white dwarfs (WDs) in AU-scale orbits that gravitationally lens solar-type companions. Forming SLBs likely requires common envelope evolution when the WD progenitor is an AGB star and has a weakly bound envelope. No SLBs have yet been discovered with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which observes far more stars than Kepler did. Identifying self-lensing in TESS data is made challenging by the fact that TESS only observes most stars for $\sim$25 days at a time, so only a single lensing event will be observed for typical SLBs. TESS's smaller aperture also makes it sensitive only to SLBs a factor of $\sim$100 brighter than those to which Kepler is sensitive. We demonstrate that TESS has nevertheless likely already observed $\sim$4 times more detectable SLBs than Kepler. We describe a search for non-repeating self-lensing signals in TESS light curves and present preliminary candidates for which spectroscopic follow-up is ongoing. We calculate the sensitivity of our search with injection and recovery tests on TESS and Kepler light curves. Based on the 5 SLBs discovered with Kepler light curves, we estimate that $(1.1 \pm 0.6)\%$ of solar-type stars are orbited by WDs with periods of 100-1000 d. This implies a space density of AU-scale WD + main sequence (MS) binaries a factor of 20-100 larger than that of astrometrically-identified WD + MS binaries with orbits in Gaia DR3. We conclude that the Gaia sample is still quite incomplete, mainly because WD + MS binaries can only be unambiguously identified as such for high mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Capabilities of Deep Learning for Processing and Interpreting One-Shot Multi-offset GPR Data: A Numerical Case Study for Lunar and Martian Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a mature geophysical method that has gained increasing popularity in planetary science over the past decade. GPR has been utilised both for Lunar and Martian missions providing pivotal information regarding the near surface geology of Terrestrial planets. Within that context, numerous processing pipelines have been suggested to address the unique challenges present in planetary setups. These processing pipelines often require manual tuning resulting to ambiguous outputs open to non-unique interpretations. These pitfalls combined with the large number of planetary GPR data (kilometers in magnitude), highlight the necessity for automatic, objective and advanced processing and interpretation schemes. The current paper investigates the potential of deep learning for interpreting and processing GPR data. The one-shot multi-offset configuration is investigated via a coherent numerical case study, showcasing the potential of deep learning for A) reconstructing the dielectric distribution of the the near surface of Terrestrial planets, and B) filling missing or bad-quality traces. Special care was taken for the numerical data to be both realistic and challenging. Moreover, the generated synthetic data are properly labelled and made publicly available for training future data-driven pipelines and contributing towards developing pre-trained foundation models for GPR.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. The different kinematic models show a strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers, which manifests itself in the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur, and they can be explained by the low rotation rate in the MHD simulations achievable for technical reasons. In these models the character of the dynamo solution is small-scale and the magnetic energy remains significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period (i.e., shorter than a rotation period) so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small. As the magnetic field is small-scale and weak, the nonlinear feedback on the flow through the Lorentz force remains small and arises essentially in terms of a slight damping of the fast timescales, whereas there is no noticeable change in flow amplitude compared to the hydrodynamic case.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Characterization of the Limb Asymmetry -- Transit Time Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheres are not spatially homogeneous. This is particularly true for hot, tidally locked exoplanets with large day-to-night temperature variations, which can yield significant differences between the morning and evening terminators -- known as limb asymmetry. Current transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are precise enough to disentangle the separate contributions of these morning and evening limbs to the overall transmission spectrum in certain circumstances. However, the signature of limb asymmetry in a transit light curve is highly degenerate with uncertainty in the planet's time of conjunction. This raises the question of how precisely transit times must be measured to enable accurate studies of limb asymmetry, in particular with JWST. Although this degeneracy has been discussed in the literature, a general description of it has not been presented. In this work, we show how this degeneracy results from apparent changes in the transit contact times when the planetary disk has asymmetric limb sizes. We derive a general formula relating the magnitude of limb asymmetry to the amount by which it would cause the apparent time of conjunction to vary, which can reach tens of seconds. Comparing our formula to simulated observations, we find that numerical fitting techniques add additional bias to the measured time, of generally less than a second, resulting from the occultation geometry. We also derive an analytical formula for this extra numerical bias. These formulae can be applied to planning new observations or interpreting literature measurements, and we show examples for commonly studied exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Chemical Composition of WD 1145+017: Impact of Circumstellar Disks Contamination on Photospheric Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 10 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk's opacity highlighted a ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to a optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.</description>
