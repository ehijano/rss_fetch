      <title>Punctual noncommutative Hilbert schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Punctual noncommutative Hilbert schemes are projective varieties parametrizing finite codimensional left ideals in noncommutative formal power series rings. We determine their motives and intersection cohomology, by constructing affine pavings and small resolutions of singularities.</description>

      <title>Multiplier modules, $V$-filtrations and Bernstein-Sato polynomials on singular ambient varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the relation between multiplier ideals and $V$-filtration on the structure sheaf due to Budur-Musta\c{t}\u{a}-Saito generalizes to singular irreducible varieties, by replacing multiplier ideals with multiplier modules and the structure sheaf with the intersection complex Hodge module.
  This is applied to a Skoda theorem for such modules as well as a $\mathcal D$-module theoretic proof of Ajit's formula relating the multiplier modules of an ideal to those of the Rees parameter in the extended Rees algebra.
  Moreover, we define a Bernstein-Sato polynomial for the pair of a variety and an ideal sheaf on it. We relate the roots to the jumping numbers of the multiplier modules. If the ideal is generated by a regular sequence on a rational homology manifold, we show that the absence of integer roots of the polynomial implies that the subvariety defined by the ideal is a rational homology manifold.</description>

      <title>When are splitting loci Gorenstein?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Splitting loci are certain natural closed substacks of the stack of vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^1$, which have found interesting applications in the Brill-Noether theory of $k$-gonal curves. In this paper, we completely characterize when splitting loci, as algebraic stacks, are Gorenstein or $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein. The main ingredients of the proof are a computation of the class groups of splitting loci in certain affine extension spaces, and a formula for the class of their canonical module.</description>

      <title>Objects of a Phantom on a Rational Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Johannes Krah showed that the blowup of $\mathbf{P}^{2}$ in $10$ general points admits a phantom subcategory. We construct three types of objects in such a phantom: a strong generator, projections of skyscraper sheaves, and a family of objects with two nonzero cohomology sheaves. We study the deformation theory of these objects to show that the phantom contains rich geometry, such as encoding the blowdown map to $\mathbf{P}^{2}$. We also show that there exists a co-connective dg-algebra whose derived category is a phantom.</description>

      <title>Weak del Pezzo surfaces yield 2-hereditary algebras and 3-Calabi-Yau algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of studying $d$-tilting bundles, which are tilting bundles whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension $d$ (or less), on $d$-dimensional smooth projective varieties has been recognized recently. In Chan's paper, it is conjectured that a smooth projective surface has a $2$-tilting bundle if and only if it is weak del Pezzo. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this endomorphism algebra becomes a $2$-representation infinite algebra whose 3-Calabi-Yau completion gives a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of the corresponding Du Val del Pezzo cone.</description>

Abstract: These are lecture notes for a course in Winter 2022/23, updated and completed in October 2025.
  The goal of the lectures is to present some recent developments around six-functor formalisms, in particular: the abstract theory of 6-functor formalisms; the 2-category of cohomological correspondences, and resulting simplifications in the proofs of Poincar\'e--Verdier duality results; the relation between 6-functor formalisms and ``geometric rings''; many examples of 6-functor formalisms, both old and new.</description>

      <title>Hilbert squares of genus 16 K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the geometry of a general polarized K3 surface $(S,h)$ of genus 16 and its Fourier-Mukai partner $(S',h')$. We prove that $S^{[2]}$ is isomorphic to the moduli space $M_{S'}(2,h',7)$ of stable sheaves with Mukai vector $(2,h',7)$ and describe the embeddings of the projectivization of the stable vector bundle of Mukai vector $(2,-h',8)$ over $S'$ into these two isomorphic hyper-K\"ahler fourfolds. Following the work of Fr\'ed\'Eric Han in arXiv:2501.16013, we explicitly construct an interesting 3-form $t_1\in \wedge^3 V_{10}^*$ which potentially gives an isomorphism between $S^{[2]}$ and the Debarre-Voisin fourfold in $G(6,V_{10})$ associated to $t_1\in \wedge^3 V_{10}^*$. This would provide a geometric explanation of the existence of such an isomorphism, which was proved in arXiv:2102.11622 by a completely different argument.</description>

      <title>Measuring birational derived splinters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with categorical methods for studying singularities. Our focus is on birational derived splinters, which is a notion that extends the definition of rational singularities beyond varieties over fields of characteristic zero. Particularly, we show that an invariant called `level' in the associated derived category measures the failure of these singularities.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Projectivized Toric Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study surjective endomorphisms of projective bundles over toric varieties, achieving three main results. First, we provide a structural theorem describing endomorphisms of projectivized split bundles over arbitrary base varieties, which we use to classify all surjective endomorphisms of Hirzebruch surfaces and construct novel families of examples. Second, for non-split equivariant bundles over toric varieties, we prove that the dynamical degree of an endomorphism of the projectivization is controlled by the base morphism; as a consequence, we establish the Kawaguchi--Silverman conjecture for such bundles. Third, using an explicit transition function method, we prove that projectivizations of tangent and cotangent bundles of smooth toric varieties admit no non-automorphic surjective endomorphisms commuting with toric morphisms on the base.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the stability scattering diagram for $\mathbb{P}^2$ and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a detailed analysis of the stability scattering diagram for $\mathbb{P}^2$ introduced by Bousseau. This scattering diagram lives in a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, and we decompose this subset into three regions, $R_{\Delta},R_{\Diamond}$ and $R_{\mathrm{unbdd}}$. The region $R_{\Delta}$ has a chamber structure whose chambers are in one-to-one correspondence with strong exceptional triples. No ray of the stability scattering diagram enters the interior of such a triangle, replicating a result of Prince, and generalizing a result of Bousseau. The region $R_{\Diamond}$ is decomposed into diamonds, which are in one-to-one correspondence with exceptional bundles. Each diamond has a vertical diagonal corresponding to a rank zero object and is traversed by a dense set of rays. Crucially, however, there are no collisions of rays inside diamonds, making it still possible to control the scattering diagram in $R_{\Diamond}$. Finally, the behaviour of $R_{\mathrm{unbdd}}$ is chaotic, in that every rational point inside it is a collision of an infinite number of rays. We show that the bounded region $R_{\mathrm{bdd}}= R_{\Delta}\cup R_{\Diamond}$ has as upper boundary the Le Potier curve, thus showing that this curve arises naturally through the algorithmic scattering process. We give an application of these results by describing the first wall-crossing for the moduli space of one-dimensional rank zero objects on $\mathbb{P}^2$. In the sequel, we apply these results to describe the full Bridgeland wall-crossing for $\mathrm{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{P}^2)$ for any $n$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a closed subvariety of an abelian variety $A$ over a global function field $k$ such that the base change of $A$ to an algebraic closure does not have any positive dimensional isotrivial quotient. We prove that every adelic point on $X$ which is the limit of a sequence of $k$-rational points on $A$ is a limit of $k$-rational points on $X$. Assuming finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group of $A$, this implies that the rational points on $X$ are dense in the Brauer set of $X$. Similar results are obtained over totally imaginary number fields, conditionally on an adelic Mordell-Lang conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and give a classification of toric non-commutative crepant resolutions (NCCRs) of Gorenstein toric singularities with divisor class group of rank one. We prove that they correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in a certain quotient of the divisor class group equipped with a certain partial order. By this classification, we show that for such toric singularities, all toric NCCRs are connected by iterated Iyama-Wemyss mutations.</description>

One of these quadrics coincides with a $C_2$-equivariant Grassmannian, and we use this calculation to prove an equivariant refinement of the result that there are 27 lines on a cubic surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$.</description>

      <title>Free resolutions and marked families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and $A$ a Noetherian $\mathbb{K}$-algebra. In a paper of 2020, M. Albert, C. Bertone, M. Roggero and W. M. Seiler proved that, given a quasi-stable module $U \subset R^m$ with $R=\mathbb{K}[x_0,\dots,x_n]$, any submodule $M\subseteq (R\otimes A)^m$ generated by a marked basis over $U$ admits a special free resolution described in terms of marked bases as well, called the {\em $U$-resolution of $M$}. In this paper, we first investigate the minimality of the $U$-resolution and its structure. When $M$ is an ideal and $A=\mathbb{K}$, we show that $M$ is componentwise linear if and only if its $U$-resolution is minimal, up to a linear change of variables. Then, adopting a functorial approach to the construction of the $U$-resolution, we prove that certain functors naturally associated with the resolution are isomorphic. These isomorphisms arise from the fact that the marked basis of the $i$-th syzygy module in the $U$-resolution can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the marked basis of $M$. Moreover, when $M$ is an ideal of depth at least 2, this correspondence can be reversed: in this case, the marked basis of $M$ itself can be written in terms of the coefficients of the marked basis of its first syzygy module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We appeal to the theory of Jouanolou torsors to model the coherent cohomology of configuration spaces of points in d-dimensional affine space. Using this model, we develop the operadic notion of chiral operations, thus generalizing the notion of chiral algebras of Beilinson and Drinfeld to higher dimensions. To produce examples, we use a higher-dimensional conceptualization of the residue which is inspired by Feynman graph integrals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working in a generic derived algebro-geometric context, we lay the foundations for the general study of affineness and local descendability. When applied to $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ rings equipped with the fpqc topology, these foundations give an $\infty$-category of spectral stacks, a viable functor-of-points alternative to Lurie's approach to nonconnective spectral algebraic geometry. Specializing further to spectral stacks over the moduli stack of oriented formal groups, we use chromatic homotopy theory to obtain a large class of $0$-affine stacks, generalizing Mathew--Meier's famous $0$-affineness result. We introduce a spectral refinement of Hopkins' stack construction of an $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ ring, and study when it provides an inverse to the global sections of a spectral stack. We use this to show that a large class of stacks, which we call reconstructible, are naturally determined by their global sections, including moduli stacks of oriented formal groups of bounded height and the moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1211.3758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cubic fourfolds behave in many ways like K3 surfaces. Certain cubics - conjecturally, the ones that are rational - have specific K3s associated to them geometrically. Hassett has studied cubics with K3s associated to them at the level of Hodge theory, and Kuznetsov has studied cubics with K3s associated to them at the level of derived categories.
  These two notions of having an associated K3 should coincide. We prove that they coincide generically: Hassett's cubics form a countable union of irreducible Noether-Lefschetz divisors in moduli space, and we show that Kuznetsov's cubics are a dense subset of these, forming a non-empty, Zariski open subset in each divisor.</description>

Abstract: Let $F:(\mathbb{C}^2,0)\to (\mathbb{C}^n,0)$ be the germ of a finite map and $(X,0)$ be its image. We will in this article using the topology of the link show that $(X,0)$ has to be a quotient singularity if it is normal and describe the possible topological types. Including a discussion of the groups and examples of how to construct a map to a given topology. We will also discuss the case when the image is not normal.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for toric GIT quotients via Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal X=[(\mathbb C^r\setminus Z)/G]$ be a toric Fano orbifold. We compute the Fourier transform of the $G$-equivariant quantum cohomology central charge of any $G$-equivariant line bundle on $\mathbb C^r$ with respect to certain choice of parameters. This gives the quantum cohomology central charge of the corresponding line bundle on $\mathcal X$, while in the oscillatory integral expression it becomes the oscillatory integral in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg mirror of $\mathcal X$. Moving these parameters to real numbers simultaneously deforms the integration cycle to the mirror Lagrangian cycle of that line bundle. This computation produces a new proof the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for $\mathcal X$.</description>

      <title>Wild Brauer classes via prismatic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $X$ a smooth proper $K$-variety with good reduction. Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of Hodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a non-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies, after a finite extension of $K$, the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer classes with surjective evaluation map. This implies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak approximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The proof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually constant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction of prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named author beyond the ordinary reduction case.</description>

      <title>Determinantal ideals of secant varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Hilbert schemes of points, we establish a number of results for a smooth projective variety $X$ in a sufficiently ample embedding. If $X$ is a curve or a surface, we show that the ideals of higher secant varieties are determinantally presented, and we prove the same for the first secant variety if $X$ has arbitrary dimension. This completely settles a conjecture of Eisenbud-Koh-Stillman for curves and partially resolves a conjecture of Sidman-Smith in higher dimensions. If $X$ is a curve or a surface we also prove that the corresponding embedding of the Hilbert scheme of points $X^{[d]}$ into the Grassmannian is projectively normal. Finally, if $X$ is an arbitrary projective scheme in a sufficiently ample embedding, then we demonstrate that its homogeneous ideal is generated by quadrics of rank three, confirming a conjecture of Han-Lee-Moon-Park. Along the way, we check that the Hilbert scheme of three points on a smooth variety is the blow-up of the symmetric product along the big diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of the monodromy conjecture for determinantal varieties. Our strategy centers on an in-depth analysis of monodromy zeta functions, leveraging a generalized A'Campo formula, an examination of multiple contact loci, and the exploitation of the intrinsic symmetric structures inherent to these varieties. Furthermore, we prove the holomorphy conjecture for determinantal varieties and the monodromy conjecture for Brill-Noether loci of generic curves. Keywords. monodromy conjecture, determinantal varieties, monodromy zeta function.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of rational motives admits several models, including those of Morel, Beilinson, Ayoub, and Voevodsky. An open question has been the equivalence of Voevodsky's Nisnevich-based $\mathrm{DM}(S, \mathbb{Q})$ with the others, which was only known over restricted base schemes.
  This paper resolves this question. We prove that all major variants of rational motives are equivalent over an arbitrary base scheme $S$, removing all previous restrictions.
  Our main technical result is a stable motivic equivalence between the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linear spectrum $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{S}]$ and the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$. This equivalence is established by reducing the problem to an unstable comparison of rationalized homotopy quotients and coarse symmetric powers, using a rational motivic Whitehead theorem we develop.
  As a byproduct, we confirm rational variant of Voevodsky's conjecture that the formation of $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ is stable under arbitrary base change.</description>

      <title>Grauert's Approximation Theorem in any Characteristic and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his seminal Inventiones paper from 1972 Grauert proved the existence of a semiuniversal deformation of an arbitrary complex analytic isolated singularity. For the proof he invented an approximation theorem for solving a system of "nested" analytic equations, which is now called Grauert's approximation theorem. To prove this, Grauert introduced standard bases for ideals in power series rings and proved a generalized Weiertrass division theorem. All this was done for convergent power series over the complex numbers.
  The purpose of this article is to extend Grauert's division and approximation theorem to convergent power series over arbitrary real valued fields of any characteristic. As an application, which was actually the motivation for this article, we derive the existence of a convergent semiuniversal deformation for an isolated singularity and a splitting lemma for not necessarily isolated hypersurface singularities over any real valued field.</description>

      <title>Fibration theorems for varieties with the weak Hilbert property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak Hilbert property (WHP) for varieties over fields of characteristic zero was introduced by Corvaja and Zannier in 2017. There exist integral variants of WHP for arithmetic schemes. We present new fibration theorems for both the WHP and its integral analogue. Our primary fibration result, in a sense dual to the mixed fibration theorems of Javanpeykar and Luger, establishes for a smooth proper morphism $f: Y \to Z$ of smooth connected varieties, that if $Z$ has the strong Hilbert property (HP) and the generic fiber has WHP, then the total space $Y$ also has WHP. As an application, we use this result in combination with previous work by Corvaja, Demeio, Javanpeykar, Lombardo, and Zannier and in combination with recent work of Javanpeykar to show that certain non-constant abelian schemes over HP varieties possess WHP. For integral WHP, we prove a new fibration theorem for proper smooth morphisms with a section, which generalizes earlier product theorems of Javanpeykar and Wittenberg, and of Luger. A key lemma gives information about the structure of covers of $Y$ whose branch locus is not dominant over $Z$.</description>

      <title>Hochschild cohomology of the second kind: Koszul duality and Morita invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hochschild cohomology of the second kind for differential graded (dg) or curved algebras as a derived functor in a compactly generated derived category of the second kind, and show that it is invariant under Morita equivalence of the second kind. A bimodule version of Koszul duality is constructed and used to show that Hochschild cohomology of the second kind is preserved under (nonconilpotent) Koszul duality. We show that Hochschild cohomology of the second kind of an algebra often computes the ordinary Hochschild cohomology of geometrically meaningful dg categories. Examples include the category of infinity local systems on a topological space, the bounded derived category of a complex algebraic manifold and the category of matrix factorizations.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation in the Multivariate and Matrix Variate Symmetric Laplace Distributions through Group Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the multivariate and matrix variate symmetric Laplace distributions through group actions. The multivariate and matrix variate symmetric Laplace distributions are not in the exponential family of distributions. We relate the maximum likelihood estimation problems of these distributions to norm minimization over a group and build a correspondence between stability of data with respect to the group action and the properties of the likelihood function.</description>

      <title>Generalized Additive Decompositions of Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the Generalized Additive Decomposition (GAD) of symmetric tensors, that is, degree-$d$ forms $f \in \mathcal{S}_d$. From a geometric perspective, a GAD corresponds to representing a point on a secant of osculating varieties to the Veronese variety, providing a compact and structured description of a tensor that captures its intrinsic algebraic properties. We provide a linear algebra method for measuring the GAD size and prove that the minimal achievable size, which we call the GAD-rank of the considered tensor, coincides with the rank of suitable Catalecticant matrices, under certain regularity assumptions. We provide a new explicit description of the apolar scheme associated with a GAD as the annihilator of a polynomial-exponential series. We show that if the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of this scheme is sufficiently small, then both the GAD and the associated apolar scheme are minimal and unique. Leveraging these results, we develop a numerical GAD algorithm for symmetric tensors that effectively exploits the underlying algebraic structure, extending existing algebraic approaches based on eigen computation to the treatment of multiple points. We illustrate the effectiveness and numerical stability of such an algorithm through several examples, including Waring and tangential decompositions.</description>
