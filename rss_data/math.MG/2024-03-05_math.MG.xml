      <title>Path Tracking using Echoes in an Unknown Environment: the Issue of Symmetries and How to Break Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of reconstructing the path of a vehicle in an unknown environment consisting of planar structures using sound. Many systems in the literature do this by using a loudspeaker and microphones mounted on a vehicle. Symmetries in the environment lead to solution ambiguities for such systems. We propose to resolve this issue by placing the loudspeaker at a fixed location in the environment rather than on the vehicle. The question of whether this will remove ambiguities regardless of the environment geometry leads to a question about breaking symmetries that can be phrased in purely mathematical terms. We solve this question in the affirmative if the geometry is in dimension three or bigger, and give counterexamples in dimension two. Excluding the rare situations where the counterexamples arise, we also give an affirmative answer in dimension two. Our results lead to a simple path reconstruction algorithm for a vehicle carrying four microphones navigating within an environment in which a loudspeaker at a fixed position emits short bursts of sounds. This algorithm could be combined with other methods from the literature to construct a path tracking system for vehicles navigating within a potentially symmetric environment.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components of sets of points in the plane that satisfy distance conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given graph whose edges are labeled with general real numbers, we consider the set of functions from the vertex set into the Euclidean plane such that the distance between the images of neighbouring vertices is equal to the corresponding edge label. This set of functions can be expressed as the zero set of quadratic polynomials and our main result characterizes the number of complex irreducible components of this zero set in terms of combinatorial properties of the graph. In case the complex components are three-dimensional, then the graph is minimally rigid and the component number is a well-known invariant from rigidity theory. If the components are four-dimensional, then they correspond to one-dimensional coupler curves of flexible planar mechanisms. As an application, we characterize the degree of irreducible components of such coupler curves combinatorially.</description>

      <title>Extremal decompositions of tropical varieties and relations with rigidity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremality and irreducibility constitute fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly within tropical geometry. While extremal decomposition is typically computationally hard, this article presents a fast algorithm for identifying the extremal decomposition of tropical varieties with rational balanced weightings. Additionally, we explore connections and applications related to rigidity theory. In particular, we prove that a tropical hypersurface is extremal if and only if it has a unique reciprocal diagram up to homothety.</description>
