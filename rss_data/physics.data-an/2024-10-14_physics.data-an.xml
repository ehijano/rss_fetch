      <title>High Level Reconstruction with Deep Learning using ILD Full Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning can give a significant impact on physics performance of electron-positron Higgs factories such as ILC and FCCee. We are working on two topics on event reconstruction to apply deep learning. The first is jet flavor tagging, in which we apply particle transformer to ILD full simulation to obtain jet flavor, including strange tagging. The second is particle flow, which clusters calorimeter hits and assigns tracks to them to improve jet energy resolution. We modified the algorithm developed in context of CMS HGCAL based on GravNet and Object Condensation techniques and add a track-cluster assignment function into the network. The overview and performance of these algorithms are described.</description>

      <title>Systematic clustering algorithm for chromatin accessibility data and its application to hematopoietic cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.10641v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The huge amount of data acquired by high-throughput sequencing requires data reduction for effective analysis. Here we give a clustering algorithm for genome-wide open chromatin data using a new data reduction method. This method regards the genome as a string of $1$s and $0$s based on a set of peaks and calculates the Hamming distances between the strings. This algorithm with the systematically optimized set of peaks enables us to quantitatively evaluate differences between samples of hematopoietic cells and classify cell types, potentially leading to a better understanding of leukemia pathogenesis.</description>

      <title>Multilayer directed random networks: Scaling of spectral properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the wide presence of multilayer networks in both natural and human-made systems, within a random matrix theory (RMT) approach, in this study we compute eigenfunction and spectral properties of multilayer directed random networks (MDRNs) in two setups composed by $M$ layers of size $N$: A line and a complete graph (node-aligned multiplex network). First, we numerically demonstrate that the normalized localization length $\beta$ of the eigenfunctions of MDRNs follows a simple scaling law given by $\beta=x^*/(1+x^*)$, with $x^*\propto (b_{\rm eff}^2/L)^\delta$, $\delta\sim 1$ and $b_{\rm eff}$ being the effective bandwidth of the adjacency matrix of the network of size $L=M\times N$. Here, $b_{\rm eff}$ incorporates both intra- and inter-layer edges. Then, we show that other eigenfunction and spectral RMT measures (the inverse participation ratio of eigenfunctions, the ratio between nearest- and next-to-nearest-neighbor eigenvalue distances, and the ratio between consecutive singular-value spacings) of MDRNs also scale with $x^*$.</description>

      <title>Linear Regression Using Quantum Annealing with Continuous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear regression is a data analysis technique, which is categorized as supervised learning. By utilizing known data, we can predict unknown data. Recently, researchers have explored the use of quantum annealing (QA) to perform linear regression where parameters are approximated to discrete values using binary numbers. However, this approach has a limitation: we need to increase the number of qubits to improve the accuracy. Here, we propose a novel linear regression method using QA that leverages continuous variables. In particular, the boson system facilitates the optimization of linear regression without resorting to discrete approximations, as it directly manages continuous variables while engaging in QA. The major benefit of our new approach is that it can ensure accuracy without increasing the number of qubits as long as the adiabatic condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Characterization of uncertainties in electron-argon collision cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predictive capability of a plasma discharge model depends on accurate representations of electron-impact collision cross sections, which determine the key reaction rates and transport properties of the plasma. Although many cross sections have been identified through experiments and quantum mechanical simulations, their uncertainties are not well-investigated. We characterize the uncertainties in electron-argon collision cross sections using a Bayesian framework. Six collision processes -- elastic momentum transfer, ionization, and four excitations -- are characterized with semi-empirical models, whose parametric uncertainties effectively capture the features important to the macroscopic properties of the plasma, namely transport properties and chemical reaction rates. The method is designed to capture the effects of systematic errors that lead to large discrepancies between some data sets. Specifically, for the purposes of Bayesian inference, each of the parametric cross section models is augmented with a Gaussian process representing systematic measurement errors as well as model inadequacies in the parametric form. The results show that the method is able to capture scatter in the data between the electron-beam experiments and ab-initio quantum simulations. The calibrated cross section models are further validated against measurements from swarm-parameter experiments.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence with static sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent flows is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. The problem is hard because of the multi-scale and out-of-equilibrium properties of turbulent transport, which lacks accurate analytical and phenomenological modeling, thus preventing a guaranteed convergence for Bayesian approaches. To overcome the risk of relying on a single unavoidably wrong model approximation, we propose a method to rank "many wrong models" and to blend their predictions. We evaluate our weighted Bayesian update algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame, and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the transport of odors in the atmospheric boundary layer. Despite minimal prior information about the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>An egonet-based approach to effective weighted network comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the impressive growth of network models in practically every scientific and technological area, we are often faced with the need to compare graphs, i.e., to quantify their (dis)similarity using appropriate metrics. This is necessary, for example, to identify networks with comparable characteristics or to spot anomalous instants in a time sequence of graphs. While a large number of metrics are available for binary networks, the set of comparison methods capable of handling weighted graphs is much smaller. Yet, the strength of connections is often a key ingredient of the model, and ignoring this information could lead to misleading results. In this paper we introduce a family of dissimilarity measures to compare undirected weighted networks. They fall into the class of alignment-free metrics: as such, they do not require the correspondence of the nodes between the two graphs and can also compare networks of different sizes. In short, they are based on the distributions, on the graph, of a few egonet features which are easily defined and computed: the distance between two graphs is then the distance between the corresponding distributions. On a properly defined testbed with a pool of weighted network models with diversified characteristics, the proposed metrics are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the model classification task. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed metrics are then demonstrated on two examples. In the first, some "filtering" schemes -- designed to eliminate non-significant links while maintaining most of the total weight -- are evaluated in their ability to produce as output a graph faithful to the original, in terms of the local structure around nodes. In the second example, analyzing a timeline of stock market correlation graphs highlights anomalies associated with periods of financial instability.</description>
