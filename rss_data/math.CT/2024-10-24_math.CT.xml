      <title>Higher inductive types in $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a definition of higher inductive types in $(\infty,1)$-categories with finite limits. We show that the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-categories with higher inductive types is finitarily presentable. In particular, the initial $(\infty,1)$-category with higher inductive types exists. We prove a form of canonicity: the global section functor for the initial $(\infty,1)$-category with higher inductive types preserves higher inductive types.</description>

      <title>A formal characterization of discrete condensed objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, proposes a generalization of topology with better categorical properties. It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a condensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf on a certain site of compact Hausdorff spaces. Since condensed sets are supposed to be a generalization of topological spaces, one would like to be able to study the notion of discreteness. There are various ways to define what it means for a condensed set to be discrete. In this paper we describe them, and prove that they are equivalent. The results have been fully formalized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Entwined comodules and contramodules over coalgebras with several objects: Frobenius, separability and Maschke theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study module like objects over categorical quotients of algebras by the action of coalgebras with several objects. These take the form of ``entwined comodules'' and ``entwined contramodules'' over a triple $(\mathscr C,A,\psi)$, where $A$ is an algebra, $\mathscr C$ is a coalgebra with several objects and $\psi$ is a collection of maps that ``entwines'' $\mathscr C$ with $A$. Our objective is to prove Frobenius, separability and Maschke type theorems for functors between categories of entwined comodules and entwined contramodules.</description>

      <title>Topological field theories associated with Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct symmetric monoidal higher categories of iterated Calabi-Yau cospans, that are noncommutative analogs of iterated lagrangian correspondences. We actually give a general (and functorial) procedure that applies to iterated nondegenerate cospans on certain comma categories. This allows us to factor the AKSZ fully extended TFT associated with the moduli of objects of a Calabi-Yau category (taking values in iterated lagrangian correspondences) through a fully extended TFT taking values in iterated Calabi-Yau cospans.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework to study organising principles in graphical representations of biochemical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardised notational system that visualises biochemical processes as networks. These visualizations lack a formal framework, so that the analysis of such networks through modelling and simulation is an entirely separate task, determined by a chosen modelling framework (e.g. differential equations, Petri nets, stochastic processes, graphs). A second research gap is the lack of a mathematical framework to compose network representations. The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction.
  We address these challenges by introducing a category-theoretic formalism for biochemical processes visualised using SBGN Process Description (SBGN-PD) language. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category and demonstrate its horizontal 1-morphisms as SBGN Process Descriptions. We obtain organisational principles such as 'compositionality' (building a large SBGN-PD from smaller ones) and 'zooming-out' (abstracting away details in biochemical processes) defined in category-theoretic terms. We also formally investigate how a particular portion of a biochemical network influences the remaining portion of the network and vice versa. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our findings using standard SBGN-PD examples.</description>

      <title>A geometrical description of untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple, geometric and explicit construction of 3d untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theory with defects of all codimensions. It is given as a symmetric monoidal functor from a defect cobordism category into the category of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces. The objects of this category are oriented stratified surfaces and its morphisms are equivalence classes of stratified cobordisms, both labelled with higher categorical data. This TQFT is constructed in terms of geometric quantities such as fundamental groupoids and bundles and requires neither state sums on triangulations nor diagrammatic calculi for higher categories. It is obtained from a functor that assigns to each defect surface a representation of a gauge groupoid and to each defect cobordism a fibrant span of groupoids and an intertwiner between the groupoid representations at its boundary. It is constructed by homotopy theoretic methods and allows for an explicit computation of examples. In particular, we show how the 2d part of this defect TQFT gives a simple description of defects of all codimensions in Kitaev's quantum double model.</description>

      <title>Clones from comonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fact that the cocommutative comonoids in a symmetric monoidal category form the best possible approximation by a cartesian category is revisited when the original category is only braided monoidal. This leads to the question when the endomorphism operad of a comonoid is a clone (a Lawvere theory). By giving an explicit example, we prove that this does not imply that the comonoid is cocommutative.</description>

      <title>Triangular Prism Equations and Categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the triangular prism equations for fusion categories, demonstrating their equivalence to the pentagon equations in the spherical case, modulo a change of basis. These equations offer valuable insights for managing complexity through localization. Additionally, we establish an enhanced version of Z. Wang's conjecture regarding the second Frobenius-Schur indicator in pivotal fusion categories. As applications, we introduce new categorification criteria and complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to FPdim 20000.</description>
