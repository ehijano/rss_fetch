      <title>Dynamics of an elliptical cylinder in confined Poiseuille flow under Navier slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of surface wetting phenomena in microchannels is essential for optimizing particle transport and filtration processes. This study numerically investigates the dynamics of a freely suspended elliptical cylinder in confined Poiseuille flow, with a focus on Navier slip boundary conditions. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics method is employed, which is advantageous for its Lagrangian framework in handling dynamic fluid-solid interfaces with slip. Our results demonstrate that the slip conditions enable precise control over inertial focusing positions and particle motion modes. Compared to no-slip scenarios, unilateral wall slip induces two novel motion types: "leaning" and "rolling". When equal slip lengths are applied to both walls, even small slip values facilitate off-center inertial focusing and elevate equilibrium positions. Slip on the cylinder surface further enhances inertial lift while suppressing rotational dynamics. In particular, under strong confinement or with large particle-surface slip lengths, we identify an additional distinct motion regime termed "inclined." These findings provide new insights for active particle manipulation in microfluidic applications.</description>

      <title>Shock compression-based equation of state for perfluorohexane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfluorohexane is a biocompatible material that serves as a liquid core for acoustically-responsive agents in biomedical applications. Despite its relatively widespread usage, there is a lack of experimental data determining its thermodynamic properties. This challenges numerical simulations to predict the acoustic response of agents developed using this material. In this study, we employ the well-established method of shock compression of materials at relatively high pressures (100--400 MPa) to estimate a kinematic equation of state for perfluorohexane. We use multi-objective optimization to obtain the Noble-Abel Stiffened-Gas equation of state, which is suitable for hydrodynamic numerical simulations. We then apply the extrapolated equation of state to simulate shock-wave propagation within a perfluorohexane droplet showing excellent agreement with equivalent experiments. This validates the equation of state and promotes the use of numerical simulations as a valuable tool for understanding the complex acoustic interactions involved in these biomedical agents, ultimately facilitating their translation for clinical purposes.</description>

      <title>Extending the range of sizes of monodisperse core-shell hydrogel capsules from composite jet breakup by combined electrical and mechanical actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of monodisperse particles or droplets is a longstanding issue across various fields, from aerosol science to inkjet printing. In bioengineering, submillimeter cell laden hydrogel capsules have proven valuable for developing in vitro tissue models. A common practical approach for producing such droplets relies on the Plateau Rayleigh instability to break up a liquid compound jet in air. However, while the droplet size is closely linked to nozzle dimensions, achieving high monodispersity suitable for quantitative biological assays remains challenging due to coalescence events associated with the beads on a string morphology of viscoelastic jets. Here, a microfluidic strategy is introduced, combining electrical and mechanical actuation to enhance control and versatility over jet breakup. By fine tuning the excitation frequency to select specific modes and applying an electric potential to regulate coalescence, a phase diagram is established, enabling the generation of monodisperse droplets over a broad size range. Notably, a previously hidden effect of the electric field on jet behavior is uncovered and quantitatively characterized. Finally, after crosslinking the compound droplets, capsules with a hydrogel envelope and a core composed of a cell suspension are formed in conditions compatible with cell proliferation, which lay the groundwork for quantitative high precision biological assays.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of the Stability of Iron Dust Bunsen Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents numerical simulations of the response of an iron dust Bunsen flame to particle seeding changes. A validated numerical model is used to study the impact of particle seeding fluctuations on flame stability. Simulations are conducted for the Bunsen setup in the right-side up and up-side down configuration. No significant differences in flame response are identified in flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations. We find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in particle loading. The sudden change in particle loading does not excite any intrinsic instabilities in the flame. Based on our results, the iron dust flames are robust to imposed fluctuations. We hypothesize that this is due to the lack of a feedback mechanism between the burned temperature and the heat release rate. This mechanism is present in conventional, chemistry-driven, gaseous flames. However, such a mechanism is absent in iron dust flames because the combustion of individual iron particles is limited by oxygen diffusion, which is insensitive to temperature.</description>

      <title>Complex Pressure Node Formation and Resonances Induced by Scatterers in a Standing-Wave Acoustic Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic pressure nodes in acoustophoretic devices are crucial for applications in tissue engineering, cell analysis, and particle trapping. Typically, a single primary node forms at the half-wavelength resonance condition, while its shape and position are constrained by the dimensions of the channel. The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their positions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could significantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this potential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional, complex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within a rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and crescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its placement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant frequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of internal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node generation. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect ratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the channel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor, which is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic energy per cycle. We show that additional nodes emerge in the presence of a scatterer, but they come at the cost of reduced acoustic pressure and energy in the channel. In summary, this study provides information on generating complex nodes in a standing wave acoustic cavity at the fundamental frequency, which has numerous applications for particle manipulation in acoustofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>When Cubic Law and Darcy Fail: Correcting Model Misspecification in Fracture Conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainties in the subsurface challenge reliable leakage risk assessments and long-term integrity of CO2 storage. Fault zones, characterised by multi-scale heterogeneities, are critical pathways for leakage and suffer from significant data uncertainties due to unresolved features. Understanding the multi-scale uncertainties in estimating fracture network conductivity is essential for mitigating leakage risks and ensuring reliable modelling of upscaled fault leakage rates. However, current models fail to capture all fault zone heterogeneity, particularly fracture surface roughness effects on fluid migration. Simplified assumptions, such as the Cubic Law based on mechanical aperture measurements, lead to erroneous models known as model misspecifications and introduce modelling uncertainty in leakage predictions. Here, we develop an AI-driven framework to address data uncertainties and correct model misspecifications in estimating fracture conductivities. By automatically integrating small-scale uncertainties, including fracture surface roughness, and leveraging their interactions across scales, we improve upon traditional empirical corrections. We combine physics-based constraints with adaptive, data-driven and geometric corrections to infer the hydraulic aperture governing fluid flow in fractures with varying roughness. This approach generates reliable local permeability maps that account for roughness effects and discrepancies between mechanical and hydraulic apertures, accurately reflecting overall fracture conductivity. By propagating uncertainties from individual fractures to network scales, our approach will support robust calibration of conductivity ranges for fault leakage sensitivity analyses, not only resolving uncertainties in fracture-scale modelling but also enabling efficient integration into larger-scale simulations to enhance predictions for subsurface CO2 storage.</description>

      <title>Multiscale geometrical Lagrangian statistics of heavy impurities in drift-wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of heavy impurities in edge plasma turbulence by analyzing their trajectories using the Hasegawa-Wakatani model. Through direct numerical simulations, we track ensembles of charged impurity particles over hundreds of eddy turnover times within statistically steady turbulent flows. Assuming that heavy impurities lag behind the flow, a novel derivation of relaxation time of heavy impurities is proposed. Our results reveal that heavy impurities can cluster within turbulence. We provide multiscale geometrical Lagrangian statistics of heavy impurities trajectories. To quantify directional changes, we analyze the scale-dependent curvature angle, along with the influence of the Stokes number on the mean curvature angles and the probability distribution function of curvature angles.</description>

      <title>Mutual friction and vortex Hall angle in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantized vortex is intimately connected with its microscopic structure and the elementary excitations of the surrounding fluid. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional motion of a single vortex orbiting a pinned anti-vortex in a unitary Fermi superfluid at varying temperature. By analyzing its trajectory, we measure the yet-unknown longitudinal and transverse mutual friction coefficients, which quantify the vortex-mediated coupling between the normal and superfluid components. Both coefficients increase while approaching the superfluid transition. They provide access to the vortex Hall angle, which is linked to the relaxation time of the localized quasiparticles occupying Andreev bound states within the vortex core, as well as the intrinsic superfluid parameter associated with the transition from laminar to quantum turbulent flows. We compare our results with numerical simulations and an analytic model originally formulated for superfluid $^3$He in the low-temperature limit, finding good agreement. Our work highlights the interplay between vortex-bound quasiparticles and delocalized thermal excitations in shaping vortex dynamics in unitary Fermi superfluids. Further, it provides a novel testbed for studying out-of-equilibrium vortex matter at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Odd Droplets: Fluids with Odd Viscosity and Highly Deformable Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flows with deformable interfaces are commonly controlled by applying an external field or modifying the boundaries that interact with the fluid, but realizing such solutions can be demanding or impractical in various scenarios. Here, we demonstrate that fluids with broken symmetries can self-control their mechanics. We present a continuum model of a viscous fluid with highly deformable interfaces subject to capillary stresses. Our model features odd viscosity, a parity-violating property that emerges in chiral fluids. Using direct numerical simulations, we focus on the impact of an odd droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. We demonstrate that odd viscosity dramatically disrupts conventional symmetric spreading by inducing asymmetric deformations and chiral flow patterns. Our analysis reveals a variety of dynamic regimes, including leftward and rightward bouncing, as well as rolling, depending on the relative strength of the odd viscosity. Our work illustrates that regulating odd viscosity provides a promising framework for controlling multiphase flows and designing functional metamaterials with tailored fluidic properties.</description>

      <title>Unified Mechanical Erosion Model for Multi-phase Mass Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erosion poses a great challenge in multi-phase mass flows as it drastically changes flow behavior and deposition pattern by dramatically increasing their masses, adversely affecting population and civil structures. There exists no mechanically-explained, unified multi-phase erosion model. We constitute a novel, unified and comprehensive mechanical erosion rates for solid and fluid phases and demonstrate their richness and urgency. This is achieved by seminally introducing interacting stresses across erosion-interface. Shear resistances from the bed against shear stresses from the landslide are based on consistent physical principles including frictional, collisional and viscous stresses. Proposed multi-phase interactive shear structures are mechanically superior and dynamically flexible. Total erosion rate is the sum of solid and fluid erosion rates which are mechanically extensive and compact. Erosion rates consistently take solid and fluid fractions from the bed and customarily supply to solid and fluid components in the flow. This overcomes severe limitations inherited by existing models. For the first time, we physically correctly construct composite, intricate erosion velocities of particle and fluid from the bed and architect the complete net momentum productions that include all interactions between solids and fluids in the landslide and bed. We invent stress correction, erosive-shear-velocity, super-erosion-drift and erosion-matrix characterizing erosion processes. By embedding well constrained extensive erosion velocities, unified erosion rates and net momentum productions including erosion-induced inertia into mass and momentum balances, we develop a novel, mechanically-explained, comprehensive multi-phase model for erosive mass flows. The new model offers great opportunities for practitioners in solving technical, engineering problems related to erosive multi-phase mass flows.</description>

      <title>Multiscale thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and their relative importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex kinetics of thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) and their relative importance during the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) using high-order discrete Boltzmann models (DBMs). First, the capabilities and differences among various discrete velocity sets in capturing TNEs and distribution functions are assessed. Practical guidelines for constructing discrete velocity stencils are proposed to enhance phase-space discretization and improve the robustness of high-order DBM simulation. At different stages of KHI and under varying initial conditions, multiscale TNEs, such as viscous stresses of different orders, emerge with distinct dominant roles. Specifically, three scenarios are identified: (i) regimes dominated by first-order TNEs,(ii) alternation between first- and second-order TNEs, and (iii) states where second-order TNEs govern the system's behavior. To quantitatively capture these transitions, criteria for TNE dominance at different orders in KHI evolution are established based on the relative thermodynamic nonequilibrium intensity (\(R_{\text{TNE}}\)). In scenarios dominated by second-order TNEs, differences between first-order and second-order models are compared in terms of macroscopic quantities, nonequilibrium effects, and kinetic moments, revealing the physical limitations of low-order models in capturing TNEs. Furthermore, the effectiveness, extensibility, and limitations of a representative high-order model are examined under second-order TNE-dominated conditions. To encapsulate these findings, a nonequilibrium phase diagram that visually maps the multiscale characteristics of KHI is constructed. This diagram not only provides intuitive insights into the dynamic interplay of different nonequilibrium effects but also serves as a kinetic roadmap for selecting suitable models under diverse nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann method for wetting problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscale computational model to describe the interaction of a droplet with a solid. The model is based on the hybrid combination of the immersed boundary and the lattice Boltzmann computational schemes: the former is used to model the non-ideal sharp interface of the droplet coupled with the inner and outer fluids, simulated with the lattice Boltzmann scheme. We further introduce an interaction force to model the wetting interactions of the droplet with the solid: this interaction force is designed with the key computational advantage of providing a regularization of the interface profile close to the contact line, avoiding abrupt curvature changes that could otherwise cause numerical instabilities. The proposed model substantially improves earlier immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann models for wetting in that it allows a description of an ample variety of wetting interactions, ranging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic cases, without the need for any pre-calibration study on model parameters to be used. Model validations against theoretical results for droplet shape at equilibrium and scaling laws for droplet spreading dynamics are addressed.</description>

      <title>Determination of non-local characteristics of density transport in 2D simulations of the SOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By use of Lagrangian tracers propagated on 2D simulations of Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) turbulence, we are able to determine the non-local fractional-advection, fractional-diffusion equation (FADE) coefficients for a number of equilibrium cases. Solutions of the resultant FADEs shows good agreement with the simulated mean density profiles. We detail how the FADE is derived: the stochastic flux equation is introduced, and it is shown how it is used to find general forms of Fick's first and second laws, dependent on the jump function. We show for spatially homogeneous jump functions which belong to the Levy-alpha Stable distribution that transport may be approximated by a non-local FADE with four parameters. This work demonstrates the sound basis for FADEs to act as reduced models of transport in systems dominated by coherent structures; so justifies the development of a first-principles approach to calculating FADE parameters.</description>
