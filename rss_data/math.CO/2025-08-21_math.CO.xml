      <title>Cycles of consecutive lengths in $3$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Lin, Wang and Zhou have proved that every $3$-connected nonbipartite graph of minimum degree at least $k$ with $k\ge 6$ and order at least $k+2$ contains $k$ cycles of consecutive lengths. They also conjecture that this result is true for $k=4, 5.$ We prove this conjecture. Our proofs use many ideas of Gao, Huo, Liu and Ma.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of toggleability spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a conjecture of Defant, Hopkins, Poznanovi\'{c}, and Propp concerning the dimensions of toggleability spaces for products of chains, shifted staircases, type-A root posets, and type-B posets. Generalizing this result, we show that for a larger family of posets defined by restricted diagrams, the dimensions of toggleability spaces are equal to the rank of the poset plus one. As part of our approach, we build upon the technique of rook statistics introduced by Chan, Haddadan, Hopkins, and Moci.</description>

      <title>Mutations of quivers with 2-cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mutation theory for quivers with oriented 2-cycles using a structure called a homotopy, defined as a normal subgroupoid of the quiver's fundamental groupoid. This framework extends Fomin-Zelevinsky mutations of 2-acyclic quivers and yields involutive mutations that preserve the fundamental groupoid quotient by the homotopy. It generalizes orbit mutations arising from quiver coverings and allows for infinite mutation sequences even when orbit mutations are obstructed. We further construct quivers with homotopies from triangulations of marked surfaces with colored punctures, and prove that flips correspond to mutations, extending the Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston model to the setting with 2-cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we initiate the study of generating functions for tight cylindric partitions. For general (i.e., $r$-rowed for $r\geq 2$) tight cylindric partitions, we provide analogs of the Corteel--Welsh functional equations. We prove closed forms for the bivariate generating functions for 2-rowed tight cylindric partitions. We also show that these partitions are in bijection with a class of partitions studied by Dousse, Hardiman, and Konan.</description>

      <title>Metrics on Signed Permutations with the Same Peak Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S^B_n$ be the Coxeter group of type B. We denote the set of indices where $\sigma\in S^B_n$ has a peak as $Peak(\sigma)$ and let $P^{B}(S;n)=\{\sigma \in S^{B}_n~|~ Peak(\sigma)=S\}$. In \cite{metrics}, Diaz-Lopez, Haymaker, Keough, Park and White considered metrics for unsigned permutations with the same peak set. In this paper, we generalize their result by studying Hamming, $l_{\infty}$, and the word metrics on $P^{B}(S;n)$ for all $S$. We also determine the minimum and maximum possible values that these metrics can achieve in these subsets of $S^B_n$.</description>

      <title>On the word-representability of $K_m$-$K_n$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Word-representable graphs are a class of graphs that can be represented by words, where edges and non-edges are determined by the alternation of letters in those words. Several papers in the literature have explored the word-representability of split graphs, in which the vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. In this paper, we initiate the study of the word-representability of graphs in which the vertices can be partitioned into two cliques. We provide a complete characterization of such word-representable graphs in terms of forbidden subgraphs when one of the cliques has a size of at most four. In particular, if one of the cliques is of size four, we prove that there are seven minimal non-word-representable graphs.</description>

      <title>Odd list-coloring of graphs of small Euler genus with no short cycles of specific types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd coloring is a variant of proper coloring and has received wide attention. We study the list-coloring version of this notion in this paper. We prove that if $G$ is a graph embeddable in the torus or the Klein bottle with no cycle of length 3, 4, and 6 such that no 5-cycles share an edge, then for every function $L$ that assigns each vertex of $G$ a set $L(v)$ of size 5, there exists a proper coloring that assigns each vertex $v$ of $G$ an element of $L(v)$ such that for every non-isolated vertex, some color appears an odd number of times on its neighborhood. In particular, every graph embeddable in the torus or the Klein bottle with no cycle of length 3, 4, 6, and 8 is odd 5-choosable. The number of colors in these results are optimal, and there exist graphs embeddable in those surfaces of girth 6 requiring seven colors.</description>

      <title>An edge-spectral Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits theorem and its stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extremal problem that relates the spectral radius $\lambda (G)$ of an $F$-free graph $G$ with its number of edges. Firstly, we prove that for any graph $F$ with chromatic number $\chi (F)=r+1\ge 3$, if $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $m$ edges, then $\lambda^2(G)\le {(1-\frac{1}{r} + o(1))2m}$. This provides a unified extension of both the Erd\H{o}s--Stone--Simonovits theorem and its vertex-spectral version due to Nikiforov, and confirms a conjecture proposed by Li, Liu and Feng.
  We also establish the corresponding edge-spectral stability, showing that if $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $m$ edges with $\lambda^2(G)=(1- \frac{1}{r} - o(1))2m$, then $G$ differs from a complete bipartite graph by $o(m)$ edges when $r=2$, and $G$ differs from an $r$-partite Tur\'{a}n graph by $o(m)$ edges when $r\ge 3$. This extends the classical Erd\H{o}s--Simonovits stability theorem.
  As an application of our method, we improve a result of Zhai, Lin and Shu by showing that if $\lambda (G)&gt;\sqrt{m}$, then there exist two vertices in $G$ that have at least $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{m} - O(1)$ common neighbors. This bound is the best possible as witnessed by a random construction.</description>

      <title>Counterexample to the conjectured coarse grid theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every $M,A,n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a graph $G$ that does not contain the $(154\times 154)$-grid as a $3$-fat minor and is not $(M,A)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_n$ minor. This refutes the conjectured coarse grid theorem by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and the weak fat minor conjecture of Davies, Hickingbotham, Illingworth, and McCarty.
  Our construction is a slight modification of the recent counterexample to the weak coarse Menger conjecture from Nguyen, Scott and Seymour.</description>

      <title>Integral bases, perfect matchings, and the Petersen graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a matching-covered graph, denote by $P$ its perfect matching polytope, and by $L$ the integer lattice generated by the integral points in $P$. In this paper, we give polyhedral proofs for two difficult results established by Lov\'{a}sz (1987), and by Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty (2002) in a series of three papers. More specifically, we reprove that $L$ has a lattice basis consisting solely of incidence vectors of some perfect matchings of $G$, $2x\in L$ for all $x\in \mathrm{lin}(P)\cap \mathbb{Z}^E$, and if $G$ has no Petersen brick then $L = \mathrm{lin}(P)\cap \mathbb{Z}^E$. This is achieved by studying the facial structure of $P$ and its relationship with the lattice $L$. Along the way, we give a new polyhedral characterization of the Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Understanding ramification of branched {$\mathbb{Z}_p$}-covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a combinatorial approach to counting the number of spanning trees at the $n$-th layer of a branched $\mathbb{Z}_p$-cover of a finite connected graph $\mathsf{X}$. Our method achieves in explaining how the position of the ramified vertices affects the count and hence the Iwasawa invariants. We do so by introducing the notion of segments, segmental decomposition of a graph, and number of segmental $t$-tree spanning forests.</description>

      <title>Connecting hypercube 1-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1-factorisation of a regular graph $G$ is a partition of its edge set $E(G)$ into perfect matchings of $G$. Behague asked for the minimal $r=r(d)$ such that some $1$-factorisation of the $d$-dimensional hypercube $Q_d$ has the property that the union of any $r$ of its 1-factors is connected. Previous work by Laufer on perfect $1$-factorisations implied that $r$ is at least three, and Behague gave a construction with $r=\big\lceil\frac{d}{2}\big\rceil+1$. We improve this upper bound, giving a random construction with $r=O(\log d)$. In other words, we prove the existence of a 1-factorisation $\mathcal{M} = \{M_1,\dotsc,M_d\}$ of the hypercube $Q_d$ such that every $\mathcal{N}\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ of size $\Omega(\log d)$ is such that $\bigcup \mathcal{N}$ is connected.</description>

      <title>Milnor fibrations and oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial model for the Milnor fibration of a complexified real arrangement using oriented matroids. It is a poset quasi-fibration, a notion recently introduced by the first author, whose domain is a subdivision of the Salvetti complex stemming from a natural subdivision of the dual oriented matroid complex. This yields a concrete finite regular CW complex which is homotopy equivalent to the Milnor fiber of the complexified real arrangement and implies that the homotopy type of the Milnor fiber of a complexified real arrangement only depends on the underlying combinatorial structure given by its oriented matroid. Moreover, our construction works for any oriented matroid, disregarding realizability, so we obtain a notion of a combinatorial Milnor fibration for any oriented matroid.</description>

      <title>Constrained Flips in Plane Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flip in a plane spanning tree $T$ is the operation of removing one edge from $T$ and adding another edge such that the resulting structure is again a plane spanning tree. For trees on a set of points in convex position we study two classic types of constrained flips: (1)~Compatible flips are flips in which the removed and inserted edge do not cross each other. We relevantly improve the previous upper bound of $2n-O(\sqrt{n})$ on the diameter of the compatible flip graph to~$\frac{5n}{3}-O(1)$, by this matching the upper bound for unrestricted flips by Bjerkevik, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber [SODA~2025] up to an additive constant of $1$. We further show that no shortest compatible flip sequence removes an edge that is already in its target position. Using this so-called happy edge property, we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to compute the shortest compatible flip sequence between two given trees. (2)~Rotations are flips in which the removed and inserted edge share a common vertex. Besides showing that the happy edge property does not hold for rotations, we improve the previous upper bound of $2n-O(1)$ for the diameter of the rotation graph to~$\frac{7n}{4}-O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Defining a phylogenetic tree with the minimum number of small-state characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent evolutionary relationships and can be uniquely defined by sets of finite-state biological characteristics. Despite prior work showing that sufficiently large trees can be determined by $r$-state character sets, the minimal leaf thresholds $n_r$ remain largely unknown. In this work, we establish the 3-state case as $n_3 = 8$, providing a concrete base for higher-state analyses. We then resolve the 5-state problem by constructing a counterexample for $n=15$ and proving that for $n \geq 16$, $\lceil (n-3)/4 \rceil$ 5-state characters suffice to uniquely define any tree. Our approach relies on rigorous mathematical induction with complete verification of base cases and logically consistent inductive steps, offering new insights into the minimal conditions for character-based tree identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the decision problem of whether a particular Gromov--Witten invariant on a partial flag variety is zero. We prove that for the $3$-pointed, genus zero invariants, this problem is in the complexity class ${\sf AM}$ assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and therefore lies in the second level of polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$.
  For the proof, we construct an explicit system of polynomial equations through a translation of the defining equations. We also need to prove an extension of the Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz to obtain our central reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of the folklore theorem, attributed to Goodwillie, that there are precisely nine model structures on the category $\mathsf{Set}$ of sets. This result is deduced from a complete study of lifting problems and the ensuing classification of all weak factorization systems on $\mathsf{Set}$. Moreover, we determine the Quillen equivalences between these model structures and exhibit an explicit example of equivalent model structures that cannot be realized by a single Quillen adjunction.</description>

      <title>On Connections Between Association Schemes and Analyses of Polyhedral and Positive Semidefinite Lift-and-Project Relaxations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.08628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore some connections between association schemes and the analyses of the semidefinite programming (SDP) based convex relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems in the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver lift-and-project hierarchy. Our analysis of the relaxations of the stable set polytope leads to bounds on the clique and stability numbers of some regular graphs reminiscent of classical bounds by Delsarte and Hoffman, as well as the notion of deeply vertex-transitive graphs -- highly symmetric graphs that we show arise naturally from some association schemes. We also study relaxations of the hypergraph matching problem, and determine exactly or provide bounds on the lift-and-project ranks of these relaxations. Our proofs for these results also inspire the study of a homogeneous coherent configuration based on hypermatchings, which is an association scheme except it is generally non-commutative. We then illustrate the usefulness of obtaining commutative subschemes from non-commutative homogeneous coherent configurations via contraction in this context.</description>

      <title>Stress-linked pairs of vertices and the generic stress matroid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a mapping $p : V(G) \to \mathbb{R}^d$, we say that the pair $(G,p)$ is a ($d$-dimensional) realization of $G$. Two realizations $(G,p)$ and $(G,q)$ are equivalent if each of the point pairs corresponding to the edges of $G$ have the same distance under the embeddings $p$ and $q$. A pair of vertices $\{u,v\}$ is globally linked in $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if for every generic realization $(G,p)$ and every equivalent realization $(G,q)$, $(G+uv,p)$ and $(G+uv,q)$ are also equivalent.
  In this paper, we introduce and investigate the notion of $d$-stress-linked vertex pairs. Roughly speaking, a pair of vertices $\{u,v\}$ is $d$-stress-linked in $G$ if the edge $uv$ is generically stressed in $G+uv$ and for every generic $d$-dimensional realization $(G,p)$, every configuration $q$ that satisfies the equilibrium stresses of $(G,p)$ also satisfies the equilibrium stresses of $(G+uv,p)$. Among other results, we show that $d$-stress-linked vertex pairs are globally linked in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we give a combinatorial characterization of $2$-stress-linked vertex pairs that matches the conjectural characterization of globally linked pairs in $\mathbb{R}^2$ due to Jackson et al.
  As a key tool, we introduce and study the ``algebraic dual'' of the $d$-dimensional generic rigidity matroid of a graph $G$, which we call the $d$-dimensional generic stress matroid of $G$. Our results about this matroid, which describes the global behavior of equilibrium stresses of generic realizations of $G$, may be of independent interest.
  We use our results to give positive answers to a conjecture of Jord\'an on minimally globally rigid graphs, a conjecture of Jord\'an and the author on globally linked vertex pairs, and to conjectures of Connelly and Grasegger et al. on rigidity properties of graphs with small separators.</description>

      <title>Reuniting $\chi$-boundedness with polynomial $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(H)\le f(\omega(H))$ for all induced subgraphs $H$ of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$. If $f$ can be chosen to be a polynomial, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Esperet proposed a conjecture that every $\chi$-bounded class of graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. This conjecture has been disproved; it has been shown that there are classes of graphs that are $\chi$-bounded but not polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Nevertheless, inspired by Esperet's conjecture, we introduce Pollyanna classes of graphs. A class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs is Pollyanna if $\mathcal{C}\cap \mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs. We prove that several classes of graphs are Pollyanna and also present some proper classes of graphs that are not Pollyanna.</description>

Abstract: A Young diagram $Y$ is called wide if every sub-diagram $Z$ formed by a subset of the rows of $Y$ dominates $Z'$, the conjugate of $Z$. A Young diagram $Y$ is called Latin if its squares can be assigned numbers so that for each $i$, the $i$th row is filled injectively with the numbers $1, \ldots ,a_i$, where $a_i$ is the length of $i$th row of $Y$, and every column is also filled injectively. A conjecture of Chow and Taylor, publicized by Chow, Fan, Goemans, and Vondrak is that a wide Young diagram is Latin. We prove a dual version of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Proof of a $K$-theoretic polynomial conjecture of Monical, Pechenik, and Searles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of a program to develop $K$-theoretic analogues of combinatorially important polynomials, Monical, Pechenik, and Searles (2021) proved two expansion formulas $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a = \sum_b Q_b^a(\beta)\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_b$ and $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a = \sum_b M_b^a(\beta)\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_b,$ where each of $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a$, $\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_a$, $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a$ and $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_a$ is a family of polynomials that forms a basis for $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n][\beta]$ indexed by weak compositions $a,$ and $Q_b^a(\beta)$ and $M_b^a(\beta)$ are monomials in $\beta$ for each pair $(a,b)$ of weak compositions. The polynomials $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a$ are the Lascoux atoms, $\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_a$ are the kaons, $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a$ are the quasiLascoux polynomials, and $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_a$ are the glide polynomials; these are respectively the $K$-analogues of the Demazure atoms $\mathfrak{A}_a$, the fundamental particles $\mathfrak{P}_a$, the quasikey polynomials $\mathfrak{Q}_a$, and the fundamental slide polynomials $\mathfrak{F}_a$. Monical, Pechenik, and Searles conjectured that for any fixed $a,$ $\sum_b Q_b^a(-1), \sum_b M_b^a(-1) \in \{0,1\},$ where $b$ ranges over all weak compositions. We prove this conjecture using a sign-reversing involution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce some (p,q)-deformations of the weight multiplicities for the representations of any simple Lie algebra g over the complex numbers. This is done by associating the indeterminate q to the positive roots of a parabolic subsystem of g and the indeterminate p to the remaining positive roots. When p=q, we just recover the usual Lusztig analogues of weight multiplicities. We then study the positivity of the coefficients in these double deformations. In particular, the positivity holds when p=1 in which case the polynomials have a natural algebraic interpretation in terms of a parabolic Brylinski filtration. For the parabolic restriction from type C to type A, this positivity result was conjectured by Lee. We also establish this positivity, in any finite type and for any p, for a stabilized version of our double deformation.</description>

Abstract: Given finite simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is a polyhedral complex having the graph homomorphisms $G\to H$ as the vertices. We determine the homotopy type of each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ when $H$ is square-free, meaning that it does not contain the $4$-cycle graph $C_4$ as a subgraph. Specifically, for a connected $G$ and a square-free $H$, we show that each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of circles. We further show that, given any graph homomorphism $f\colon G\to H$ to a square-free $H$, one can determine the homotopy type of the connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ containing $f$ algorithmically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define real origami (that is, origami equipped with a real structure) and enumerate them using the combinatorics of zonal polynomials. We explicitly express in terms of sums of divisors the numbers of genus 2 real origami with 2 simple zeros and the numbers of genus 3 real origami with 2 double zeros showing that their generating functions are quantum modular forms. Furthermore, we show that by replacing zonal polynomials with Schur polynomials we can effectively count the classical (complex) origami. As a byproduct, we establish a connection between classical origami and a specific class of double Hurwitz numbers. Finally, we discuss some conjectures and open questions involving Jack functions, quantum modular forms, and integrable hierarchies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study large minors in small-set expanders. More precisely, we consider graphs with $n$ vertices and the property that every set of size at most $\alpha n / t$ expands by a factor of $t$, for some (constant) $\alpha &gt; 0$ and large $t = t(n)$. We obtain the following:
  * Improving results of Krivelevich and Sudakov, we show that a small-set expander contains a complete minor of order $\sqrt{n t / \log n}$.
  * We show that a small-set expander contains every graph $H$ with $O(n \log t / \log n)$ edges and vertices as a minor. We complement this with an upper bound showing that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ has average degree $d$, then there exists a graph with $O(n \log d / \log n)$ edges and vertices which is not a minor of $G$. This has two consequences: (i) It implies the optimality of our result in the case $t = d^c$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, and (ii) it shows expanders are optimal minor-universal graphs of a given average degree.</description>

      <title>The edge-statistics conjecture for hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r,k,\ell$ be integers such that $0\le\ell\le\binom{k}{r}$. Given a large $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$, we consider the fraction of $k$-vertex subsets which span exactly $\ell$ edges. If $\ell$ is 0 or $\binom{k}{r}$, this fraction can be exactly 1 (by taking $G$ to be empty or complete), but for all other values of $\ell$, one might suspect that this fraction is always significantly smaller than 1.
  In this paper we prove an essentially optimal result along these lines: if $\ell$ is not 0 or $\binom{k}{r}$, then this fraction is at most $(1/e) + \varepsilon$, assuming $k$ is sufficiently large in terms of $r$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and $G$ is sufficiently large in terms of $k$. Previously, this was only known for a very limited range of values of $r,k,\ell$ (due to Kwan-Sudakov-Tran, Fox-Sauermann, and Martinsson-Mousset-Noever-Truji\'{c}). Our result answers a question of Alon-Hefetz-Krivelevich-Tyomkyn, who suggested this as a hypergraph generalisation of their "edge-statistics conjecture". We also prove a much stronger bound when $\ell$ is far from 0 and $\binom{k}{r}$.</description>

We verify this conjecture for families of geometric lattices including perfect matroid designs, Dowling lattices, and for a class of geometric lattices that contains all lattices of flats of paving matroids.
  We also investigate how the conjecture behaves with respect to certain operations such as direct products, ordinal sums and single-element extensions.</description>

Abstract: The hook length formula for $d$-complete posets expresses the number of linear extensions of a $d$-complete poset $P$ in terms of hooks of $P$. It generalizes the usual hook length formula for standard Young tableaux, as well as hook length formulas for shifted Young tableaux and trees. We give a new proof of the hook length formula for $d$-complete posets which is elementary and purely combinatorial. Our approach is to define a generalization of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth bijection for $d$-complete posets, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Cycles in Simplicial and Supersolvable Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Gray code interpretation of Hamiltonian cycles in Cayley graphs, we investigate the existence of Hamiltonian cycles in tope graphs of hyperplane arrangements, with a focus on simplicial, reflection, and supersolvable arrangements. We confirm Hamiltonicity for all 3-dimensional simplicial arrangements listed in the Gr\"unbaum--Cuntz catalogue. Extending earlier results by Conway, Sloane, and Wilks, we prove that all restrictions of finite reflection arrangements, including all Weyl groupoids and crystallographic arrangements, admit Hamiltonian cycles. Finally, we further establish that all supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and supersolvable oriented matroids have Hamiltonian cycles, offering a constructive proof based on their inductive structure.</description>

      <title>On the Constant-Depth Circuit Complexity of Generating Quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00133v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constant-depth circuit complexity of the Isomorphism Problem, Minimum Generating Set Problem (MGS), and Sub(quasi)group Membership Problem (Membership) for groups and quasigroups (=Latin squares), given as input in terms of their multiplication (Cayley) tables. Despite decades of research on these problems, lower bounds for these problems even against depth-$2$ AC circuits remain unknown. Perhaps surprisingly, Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, and Wagner (FSTTCS 2010; ACM Trans. Comput. Theory, 2013) showed that Quasigroup Isomorphism could be solved by AC circuits of depth $O(\log \log n)$ using $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits, a class we denote $\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL$. We narrow this gap by improving the upper bound for many of these problems to $quasiAC^0$, thus decreasing the depth to constant.
  In particular, we show:
  - MGS for quasigroups is in $\exists^{\log^2(n)}\forall^{\log n}NTIME(\mathrm{polylog}(n))\subseteq quasiAC^0$. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 1996) conjectured that this problem was $\exists^{\log^2(n)}P$-complete; our results refute a version of that conjecture for completeness under $quasiAC^0$ reductions unconditionally, and under polylog-space reductions assuming EXP $\neq$ PSPACE.
  - MGS for groups is in $AC^{1}(L)$, improving on the previous upper bound of $P$ (Lucchini &amp; Thakkar, J. Algebra, 2024).
  - Quasigroup Isomorphism belongs to $\exists^{\log^2(n)}AC^0(DTISP(\mathrm{polylog},\log)\subseteq quasiAC^0$, improving on the previous bound of $\exists^{\log^2(n)}L\cap\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL\subseteq quasiFOLL$ (Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, &amp; Wagner, ibid.; Levet, Australas. J. Combin., 2023).
  Our results suggest that understanding the constant-depth circuit complexity may be key to resolving the complexity of problems concerning (quasi)groups in the multiplication table model.</description>

      <title>A cornering strategy for synchronizing a DFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the existence of short synchronizing words in deterministic finite automata (DFAs). We define two general strategies for generating synchronizing words, and we show that each of these strategies can be applied if and only if a DFA is synchronizable. Furthermore, we show that if a synchronizable DFA is well-structured, then our strategies generate short synchronizing words. The first of our strategies, called the cornering strategy, takes advantage of states in a DFA with properties similar to those of a polytope vertex. The second of our strategies, similar to the cornering strategy and called the $f$-ordered strategy, takes advantage of a partial order defined on the states of a DFA.
  We apply our cornering strategy to the class of difference DFAs, whose states form subsets of $\mathbb R^d$ and whose input symbols correspond to translation vectors between states. We show that difference DFAs share many similarities with aperiodic DFAs, and in particular, a difference DFA $M$ has a synchronizing word if and only if it has a universally reachable state. Using the cornering strategy, we also show that under certain conditions, such an $n$-state DFA $M$ has a synchronizing word of length at most $(n-1)^2$ and thereby satisfies \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture. Using the $f$-ordered strategy, we also show that a synchronizable DFA whose states have a certain partial order that is preserved by a set of short words also has a short synchronizing word, and we consider several consequences of this result.
  Finally, we consider how the cornering strategy can be applied to the problem of synchronizing the product of two DFAs $M_1, M_2$ that share a common alphabet, and we show that the product $M_1 \times M_2$ often has a synchronizing word that is subquadratic in the number of states of $M_1 \times M_2$.</description>

      <title>Universal piecewise polynomiality for counting curves in toric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by piecewise polynomiality results of double Hurwitz numbers, Ardila and Brugall\'e introduced an enumerative problem which they call double Gromov--Witten invariants of Hirzebruch surfaces. These invariants serve as a two-dimensional analogue and satisfy a similar piecewise polynomial structure. More precisely, they introduced the enumeration of curves in Hirzebruch surfaces satisfying point conditions and tangency conditions on the two parallel toric boundaries. These conditions are stored in four partitions and the resulting invariants are piecewise polynomial in their entries. Moreover, they found that these expressions also behave polynomially with respect to the parameter determining the underlying Hirzebruch surfaces. Based on work of Ardila and Block, they proposed that such a polynomiality could also hold while changing between more general toric surfaces corresponding to $h$-transverse polygons. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Moreover, we express the resulting invariants for $h$-transverse polygons as matrix elements in the two-dimensional bosonic Fock space.</description>

      <title>Vogel's universality and Macdonald dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss algebraic universality in the sense of P. Vogel for the simplest refined quantity, the Macdonald dimensions. The main known source of universal quantities is given by Chern-Simons theory. Refinement of Chern-Simons theory means introducing additional parameters. At the level of symmetric functions, the refinement is the transition from the Schur functions to the Macdonald polynomials. We consider the Macdonald polynomials associated with the simple Lie algebras, define Macdonald dimensions and dual Macdonald dimensions, and present a universal formula for them that unifies these quantities for algebras associated with simply laced root systems. We also consider mixed Macdonald dimensions that depend on two different root systems.</description>

      <title>Isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem, formulated by Krasner in the 1950's, in the context of Polish (i.e. separable complete) ultrametric spaces by providing a characterization of their isometry groups using suitable forms of generalized wreath products of full permutation groups. Since our solution is developed in the finer context of topological (Polish) groups, it also solves a problem of Gao and Kechris from 2003. Furthermore, we provide an exact correspondence between the isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces belonging to some natural subclasses and various kinds of generalized wreath products proposed in the literature by Hall, Holland, and Malicki.</description>
