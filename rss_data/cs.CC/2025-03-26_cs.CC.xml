      <title>Upper and Lower Bounds for the Linear Ordering Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Korten and Pitassi (FOCS, 2024) defined a new complexity class $L_2P$ as the polynomial-time Turing closure of the Linear Ordering Principle. They asked whether a Karp--Lipton--style collapse can be proven for $L_2P$. We answer this question affirmatively by showing that $P^{prMA}\subseteq L_2P$. As a byproduct, we also answer an open question of Chakaravarthy and Roy (Computational Complexity, 2011) whether $P^{prMA}\subseteq S_2P$.
  We complement this result by providing a new upper bound for $L_2P$, namely $L_2P\subseteq P^{prSBP}$. Thus we are placing $L_2P$ between $P^{prMA}$ and $P^{prSBP}$. One technical ingredient of this result is an algorithm that approximates the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean circuit using a $prSBP$ oracle (i.e. in $FP^{prSBP}$), which could be of independent interest.
  Finally, we prove that $P^{prO_2P}\subseteq O_2P$, which implies that the Karp--Lipton--style collapse to $P^{prOMA}$ is actually better than both known collapses to $P^{prMA}$ due to Chakaravarthy and Roy (Computational Complexity, 2011) and to $O_2P$ also due to Chakaravarthy and Roy (STACS, 2006).</description>

      <title>High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under weaker noise conditions, our method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds, while also exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</description>

      <title>On the Chow-rank of the permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Glynn's formula from Ryser's formula for the permanent. We further establish via an orbital argument that Glynn's formula yields an optimal row-homogeneous Chow-decomposition of the permanent. We introduce a method for upper-bounding the Chow-rank of polynomials. Our method is based upon the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials. Finally we derive a parametric description of rank revealing row-homogeneous Chow-decompositions of the permanent. Our result provides an alternative approach to the parametrization first obtained by Glynn.</description>

      <title>Complexity of chess domination problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study different domination problems of attacking and non-attacking rooks and queens on polyominoes and polycubes of all dimensions. Our main result proves that maximum independent domination is NP-complete for non-attacking queens and for non-attacking rooks on polycubes of dimension three and higher. We also analyze these problems for polyominoes and convex polyominoes, conjecture the complexity classes, and provide a computer tool for investigation. We have also computed new values for classical queen domination problems on chessboards (square polyominoes). For our computations, we have translated the problem into an integer linear programming instance. Finally, using this computational implementation and the game engine Godot, we have developed a video game of minimum domination of queens and rooks on randomly generated polyominoes.</description>

      <title>A quantum neural network framework for scalable quantum circuit approximation of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Lie group theoretic approach for parametric representation of unitary matrices. This leads to develop a quantum neural network framework for quantum circuit approximation of multi-qubit unitary gates. Layers of the neural networks are defined by product of exponential of certain elements of the Standard Recursive Block Basis, which we introduce as an alternative to Pauli string basis for matrix algebra of complex matrices of order $2^n$. The recursive construction of the neural networks implies that the quantum circuit approximation is scalable i.e. quantum circuit for an $(n+1)$-qubit unitary can be constructed from the circuit of $n$-qubit system by adding a few CNOT gates and single-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Approximating Klee's Measure Problem and a Lower Bound for Union Volume Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Union volume estimation is a classical algorithmic problem. Given a family of objects $O_1,\ldots,O_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we want to approximate the volume of their union. In the special case where all objects are boxes (also known as hyperrectangles) this is known as Klee's measure problem. The state-of-the-art algorithm [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] for union volume estimation and Klee's measure problem in constant dimension $d$ computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation with constant success probability by using a total of $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries of the form (i) ask for the volume of $O_i$, (ii) sample a point uniformly at random from $O_i$, and (iii) query whether a given point is contained in $O_i$.
  We show that if one can only interact with the objects via the aforementioned three queries, the query complexity of [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] is indeed optimal, i.e., $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Our lower bound already holds for estimating the union of equiponderous axis-aligned polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and even if the algorithm is allowed to inspect the coordinates of the points sampled from the polygons, and still holds when a containment query can ask containment of an arbitrary (not sampled) point.
  Guided by the insights of the lower bound, we provide a more efficient approximation algorithm for Klee's measure problem improving the $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ time to $O((n+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}) \cdot \log^{O(d)}n)$. We achieve this improvement by exploiting the geometry of Klee's measure problem in various ways: (1) Since we have access to the boxes' coordinates, we can split the boxes into classes of boxes of similar shape. (2) Within each class, we show how to sample from the union of all boxes, by using orthogonal range searching. And (3) we exploit that boxes of different classes have small intersection, for most pairs of classes.</description>
