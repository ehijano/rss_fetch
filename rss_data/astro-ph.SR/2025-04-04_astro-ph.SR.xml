      <title>Three-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer effects in Fe I lines IV. Line formation at high spatial resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first three papers of this series, we investigated the formation of photospheric neutral iron lines in different atmospheres ranging from idealised flux tube models to complex three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations. The overarching goal was to understand the role of Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) and horizontal radiative transfer (RT) effects in the formation of these lines. In the present paper, we extend this investigation using a high resolution MHD simulation, with a grid spacing much smaller than the currently resolvable scales by telescopes. We aim to understand whether the horizontal RT effects imposes an intrinsic limit on the small scale structures that can be observed by telescopes, by spatially smearing out these structures in the solar atmosphere. We synthesize the Stokes profiles of two iron line pairs, one at 525 nm and other at 630 nm in 3-D NLTE. We compare our results with those in previous papers and check the impact of horizontal transfer on the quality of the images. Our results with the high resolution simulations align with those inferred from lower resolution simulations in the previous papers of this series. The spatial smearing due to horizontal RT, although present, is quite small. The degradation caused by the point spread function of a telescope is much stronger. In the photospheric layers, we do not see an image degradation caused by horizontal RT that is large enough to smear out the small scale structures in the simulation box. The current generation telescopes with spatial resolutions smaller than the horizontal photon mean free path should in principle be able to observe the small scale structures, at least in the photosphere.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared extinction curve for protostellar envelopes from JWST-detected embedded jet emission: the case of TMC1A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains poorly constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales &lt;~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

      <title>Anomalous cross-field motions of solar coronal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present several examples of unusual evolutionary patterns in solar coronal loops that resemble cross-field drift motions. These loops were simultaneously observed from two vantage points by two different spacecraft: the High-Resolution Imager (HRI$_{EUV}$) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager aboard the Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Across all these events, a recurring pattern is observed: Initially, a thin, strand-like structure detaches and shifts several megameters (Mm) away from a main or parent loop. During this period, the parent loop remains intact in its original position. After a few minutes, the shifted strand reverses its direction and returns to the location of the parent loop. Key features of this `split-drift' type evolution are: (i) the presence of kink oscillations in the loops before and after the split events, (ii) a sudden split motion at about 30~km.s$^{-1}$, with additional slow drifts, either away from or back to the parent loops, at around 5~km.s$^{-1}$. Co-temporal photospheric magnetic field data obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) reveal that during such split-drift evolution, one of the loop points in the photosphere moves back and forth between nearby magnetic polarities. While the exact cause of this `split-drift' phenomenon is still unclear, the consistent patterns observed in its characteristics indicate that there may be a broader physical mechanism at play. This underscores the need for further investigation through both observational studies and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Identify Main-sequence Binaries from the Chinese Space Station Telescope Survey with Machine Learning. II. Based on Gaia and GALEX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical characteristics of double main-sequence (MS) binaries are essential for investigating star formation, binary evolution, and population synthesis. Our previous study proposed a machine learning-based method to identify MS binaries from MS single stars using mock data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). We further utilized detection efficiencies and an empirical mass ratio distribution to estimate the binary fraction within the sample. To further validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted a more realistic sample simulation, incorporating additional factors such as metallicity, extinction, and photometric errors from CSST simulations. The detection efficiency for binaries with mass ratios between 0.2 and 0.7 reached over 80%. We performed a detailed observational validation using the data selected from the Gaia Sky Survey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer. The detection efficiency for MS binaries in the observed sample was 65%. The binary fraction can be inferred with high precision for a set of observed samples, based on accurate empirical mass ratio distribution.</description>

      <title>Identify main-sequence binaries from the Chinese Space Station Telescope Survey with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical properties of double main sequence (MS) binaries are very important for binary evolution and binary population synthesis. To obtain these properties, we need to identify these MS binaries. In this paper, we have developed a method to differentiate single MS stars from double MS binaries from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) Survey with machine learning. This method is reliable and efficient to identify binaries with mass ratios between 0.20 and 0.80, which is independent of the mass ratio distribution. But the number of binaries identified with this method is not a good approximation to the number of binaries in the original sample due to the low detection efficiency of binaries with mass ratios smaller than 0.20 or larger than 0.80. Therefore, we have improved this point by using the detection efficiencies of our method and an empirical mass ratio distribution and then can infer the binary fraction in the sample. Once the CSST data are available, we can identify MS binaries with our trained multi-layer perceptron model and derive the binary fraction of the sample.</description>

      <title>Mode identification revisit and asteroseismology of the DAV star TIC 231277791</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs are the final stage for most low and intermediate mass stars, which plays an important role in understanding stellar evolution and galactic history. Here we performed an asteroseismological analysis on TIC 231277791 based on 10 independent modes reported by Romero et al. Two groups of modes were identified with frequency splitting: mode identification$\_{1}$ with one $l$\,=\,1, $m$\,=\,0 mode, two $l$\,=\,2, $m$\,=\,0 modes, and three $l$\,=\,1 or 2, $m$\,=\,0 modes, and mode identification$\_{2}$ wtih one $l$\,=\,1, $m$\,=\,0 mode, three $l$\,=\,2, $m$\,=\,0 modes, and one $l$\,=\,1 or 2, $m$\,=\,0 mode. The rotation period is derived to be 41.64\,$\pm$\,2.73\,h for TIC 231277791. We established a large sample (7,558,272) of DAV star models using the White Dwarf Evolution Code (\texttt{WDEC}; 2018, v16), resulting of optimal models with model$\_{1}$ (mode identification$\_{1}$): $M_\mathrm{*}$\,=\,0.570\,$\pm$\,0.005\,$M_\mathrm{\odot}$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$\,=\,11300\,$\pm$\,10\,K, -log($M_\mathrm{H}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,9.15\,$\pm$\,0.01, -log($M_\mathrm{He}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,4.94\,$\pm$\,0.01, and $\sigma_{\textup{RMS}}$\,=\,0.06\,s, and model$\_{2}$ (mode identification$\_{2}$): $M_\mathrm{*}$\,=\,0.720\,$\pm$\,0.005\,$M_\mathrm{\odot}$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$\,=\,11910\,$\pm$\,10\,K, -log($M_\mathrm{H}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,6.11\,$\pm$\,0.01, -log($M_\mathrm{He}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,3.09\,$\pm$\,0.01, and $\sigma_{\textup{RMS}}$\,=\,0.04\,s. The central oxygen abundances are 0.71 (optimal model$\_{1}$) and 0.72 (optimal model$\_{2}$), respectively, which are consistent with the results of stellar structure and evolution theory.</description>

      <title>Coronal and chromospheric activity of Teegarden's star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teegarden's star is a late-type M-dwarf planet host, typically showing only rather low levels of activity. In this paper we present an extensive characterisation of this activity at photospheric, chromospheric, and coronal levels. We specifically investigated TESS observations of Teegarden's star, which showed two very large flares with an estimated flare fluence between 10$^{29}$ and 10$^{32}$\,erg comparable to the largest solar flares. We furthermore analysed nearly 300 CARMENES spectra and 11 ESPRESSO spectra covering all the usually used chromospheric lines in the optical from the \ion{Ca}{ii} H \&amp; K lines at 3930\,\AA\, to the \ion{He}{i} infrared triplet at 10830\,\AA. These lines show different behaviour: The \ion{He}{i} infrared triplet is the only one absent in all spectra, some lines show up only during flares, and others are always present and highly variable. Specifically, the H$\alpha$ line is more or less filled in during quiescence; however, the higher Balmer lines are still observed in emission. Many chromospheric lines show a correlation with H$\alpha$ variability, which, in addition to stochastic behaviour, also shows systematic behaviour on different timescales including the rotation period. Moreover, we found several flares and also report hints of an erupting prominence, which may have led to a coronal mass ejection. Finally, we present X-ray observations of Teegarden's star (i.e. a discovery pointing obtained with the \emph{Chandra} observatory) and an extensive study with the \emph{XMM-Newton} observatory; when these two large flares were observed, one of them showed clear signatures of the Neupert effect, suggesting the production of hard X-rays in the system.</description>

      <title>Mass, Luminosity, and Stellar Age of Early-type Stars from the LAMOST Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass ($M$) and luminosity ($L$) are fundamental parameters of stars but can only be measured indirectly. Typically, effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravity (${\rm log}\ g$) and metallicity ([M/H]) are derived from stellar spectra, then $M$, $L$ and stellar age ($t$) can be obtained by interpolating in the grid of stellar evolutionary models. In this paper, we use the Random Forest (RF) in combination with the evolutionary grid from PARSEC 1.2S to determine $M$, $L$, $t$ and initial mass ($M_{\rm i}$) for early-type main-sequence stars ($T_{\rm eff}\geq 7,000\ {\rm K}$) as identified from the LAMOST survey. The convex hull algorithm is employed to select the main-sequence stars. The results demonstrate that the prediction precision is $32\%$ and $9\%$ for $L$ and $M$, respectively, which is comparable to that achieved by fitting evolutionary tracks. Furthermore, the predicted $L$ also aligns with Gaia's observations, with a relative difference of $36\%$. The prediction for $t$ is relatively less accurate, indicating a difference of 0.44 Gyr for two components in wide binaries. This discrepancy is due to the inconsistent metallicity measurements. For the two sets of atmospheric parameters we used, the relative differences in $L$, $M$, $t$ and $M_{\rm i}$ are $29\%$, $7\%$, $36\%$ and $7\%$, respectively. The influence of metallicity on these parameters is analyzed, with the conclusion that metallicity has the greatest impact on $t$. Consequently, two catalogs are presented, which would be useful for studying stellar populations such as the luminosity function and initial mass function of early-type stars.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Observations of a Small-Scale Cancellation Nanoflare: Supporting Evidence for the Cancellation Nanoflare Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical cancellation nanoflare model has recently been established to show the fundamental role that ubiquitous small-scale cancellation nanoflares play in solar atmospheric heating. Although this model is well-supported by simulations, observational evidence is needed to deepen our understanding of cancellation nanoflares. We present observations of a small-scale cancellation nanoflare event, analyzing its magnetic topology evolution, triggers, and physical parameters. Using coordinated observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory and Goode Solar Telescope, we identify a photospheric flow-driven cancellation event with a flux cancellation rate of ~10^{15} Mx/s and a heating rate of 8.7 x 10^6 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The event shows the characteristic transition from $\pi$-shaped to X-shaped magnetic configuration before forming a two arcsecs current sheet, closely matching model predictions. This event provides critical observational support for the cancellation nanoflare model and its role in solar atmospheric heating.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Sun to Sun-like stars. On the importance of addressing faculae/spot domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the Sun is an ordinary G-type star is still an open scientific question. Stellar surveys by Kepler and TESS, however, revealed that Sun-like stars tend to show much stronger flare activity than the Sun. This study aims to reassess observed flare and spot activity of Sun-like Kepler stars by fine-tuning the criteria for a more robust definition of Sun-like conditions and better comparability between the current Sun and Sun-like stars. We update one of the recent stellar Sun-like star samples by applying new empirical stellar relations between the starspot size and the effective stellar temperature to derive more reliable starspot group sizes. From the 265 solar-type stars, we could select 48 stars supporting the Kepler 30-minute cadence light curves. These were analyzed by implementing the gradient of the power spectra method to distinguish between spot- and faculae-dominated stars. We employed the $\alpha$-factor to quantify the area ratio of bright and dark features on the stellar surface. We were able to group the 48 stars as being spot- or faculae-dominated, revealing a preferential distribution of the Kepler Sun-like stars towards the spot-dominated (44 stars) and transitional (four stars) regimes. As the current Sun is faculae-dominated, only the transitional stars were utilized for further evaluation. Additionally, accounting for comparability in stellar mass, radius, and rotation period, we show that only one of the utilized 265 Sun-like stars in the Kepler sample (i.e., KIC 11599385) allows for direct comparison to the current Sun. We further show that the single flare observed on KIC 11599385 falls right within the flare energy range estimated for the AD774/775 event observed in the cosmogenic radionuclide archives of $^{10}$Be, $^{14}$C, and $^{36}$Cl.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Spatiotemporal Properties of the Quasi-periodic Pulsations in the Balmer Continuum at 3600 \AA\ in an X-class Solar White-light Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the Balmer continuum of solar white-light flares (WLFs) are rarely reported, and accurately pinpointing the spatial source of flaring QPPs remains a significant challenge. We present spatiotemporal characteristics of QPPs of an X2.8 two-ribbon solar WLF (SOL2023-12-14T17:02), which was well observed by the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, with high-cadence imaging (1--2 s) in the Balmer continuum at 3600 \AA. Combined with additional multi-instrument data, we find that the enhancement of the WLF in both Balmer and Paschen continua shows strong spatiotemporal correlation with hard X-ray (HXR) emissions. Notably, the pulses in the WST Balmer continuum exhibited a near-zero time lag with most HXR pulses, whereas soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emissions showed a lag of 2--3 s. Interestingly, quasi-harmonic QPPs with periods of $\sim$11 s and $\sim$20 s were observed in multiple wavelengths in the rising phase of the white-light continuum. Furthermore, we employed Fourier transform to spatially locate the QPPs around 11 and 20 s, revealing that they primarily originated from the east flare ribbon, which exhibited the most substantial continuum enhancement. More interestingly, we find that the west ribbon contributed significantly to the 11-second QPP but had a weaker contribution to the 20-second QPP. Moreover, the occurrence of quasi-harmonic QPPs is temporally coincident with the rapid elongation and separation motions of flare ribbons. Possible mechanisms for the quasi-harmonic QPPs have been discussed. These observations provide valuable insights into QPP modeling for solar and stellar flares.</description>

Abstract: The origin of fluorine is still a debated question. AGB stars synthesise this element and likely contribute significantly to its synthesis in the present-day Universe. However, it is not clear whether other sources contribute, especially in the early Universe. We discuss variations of the surface abundances of fluorine coming from our massive star models and compare them with available present-day observations. We compute the contribution of massive stars in producing 19F over metallicities covering the whole cosmic history. We used models in the mass range of 9Msol &lt; Mini &lt; 300Msol at metallicities from Pop III up to super-solar while accounting for the required nuclear network to follow the evolution of 19F during the core H- and He-burning phases. Results from models with and without rotational mixing are presented. We find that rotating models predict a slight depletion of fluorine at their surface at the end of the MS phase. In more advanced evolutionary phases, only models with an initial mass larger than 25Msol at metallicities Z &gt; 0.014 show phases where the abundance of fluorine is enhanced. This occurs when the star is a WR star of the WC type. WC stars can show surface abundances of fluorine ten times larger than their initial abundance. However, we obtained that the winds of massive stars at metallicities larger than Z=0.006 do not significantly contribute to fluorine production, confirming previous findings. In contrast, very metal-poor rapidly rotating massive star models may be important sources of fluorine through the mass expelled at the time of their SN explosion. Observations of WC stars at solar or super-solar metallicities may provide very interesting indications on the nuclear pathways that lead to fluorine production in massive stars. The possibility of observing fluorine-rich CEMPs is also a way to put constrains in present models at very low metallicities.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry for Discerning Geometry and Structure in Circumstellar Media of Hot Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetric techniques are a mainstay of astrophysical inquiry, ranging from Solar System objects to the Cosmic Background Radiation. This review highlights applications of stellar polarimetry for massive hot stars, particularly in the context of ultraviolet (UV) spaceborne missions. The prevalence of binarity in the massive star population and uncertainties regarding the degree of rotational criticality among hot stars raises important questions about stellar interactions, interior structure, and even the lifetimes of evolutionary phases. These uncertainties have consequences for stellar population synthesis calculations. Spectropolarimetry is a key tool for extracting information about stellar and binary geometries. We review methodologies involving electron scattering in circumstellar envelopes; gravity darkening from rapid rotation; spectral line effects including the (a) "line effect", (b) Ohman effect, and (c) Hanle effect; and the imprint of interstellar polarization on measurements. Finally, we describe the Polstar UV spectropolarimetric SMEX mission concept as one means for employing these diagnostics to clarify the state of high rotation and its impacts for massive stars.</description>

      <title>Vortex Flows in the Solar Atmosphere: Detection and Heating Mechanisms in 3D MHD Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex flows are structures associated with the rotation of the plasma and/or the magnetic field that are present throughout the solar atmosphere. In recent years, their study has become increasingly important, as they are present on a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales and can connect several layers of the solar atmosphere. In this work, we focused on the detection and analysis of these structures in an automatic way. We use realistic 3D MHD numerical simulations obtained with the Mancha3D code at different magnetic field configurations and spatial resolutions. The vortex detection has been performed using the novel SWIRL code. We have been able to determine multiple structures associated with small and large scale vortices that extend in height in our simulations. We performed a statistical analysis of these structures, quantifying their number and typical sizes, as well as their temperature and heating profiles, confirming their importance in the energy transport.</description>

      <title>Strikingly high fraction of fast rotators in Magellanic Cloud star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been growing evidence that the rich star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds contain significant fractions of rapidly rotating stars. In this work, we aim to constrain these fractions by studying the colour-magnitude diagrams of four star clusters, selected among those with the most striking signatures of fast rotators. Using isochrones derived from PARSEC v2.0 stellar tracks, we generate distinct stellar populations, each covering a limited interval of initial rotation rates $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, referred to as 'Partial Models' (PMs). Using optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo Markov Chains, PMs are combined to create the final best-fitting model. In our analysis, we adopt two key assumptions: a uniform age and an isotropic distribution of stellar spin axes within each cluster. The solutions are allowed to explore the entire range of $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, and different values of age, metallicity, distance and foreground extinction. We find that the rotational velocity distributions in all four clusters reveal a high fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}$ close to the break-up value, in all cases. Specifically, the fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}&gt;0.7$ exceeds $80\%$ in the clusters NGC 419 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and NGC 1831 and NGC 1866 of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For NGC 2203 of the LMC, this fraction is smaller, although it still exceeds $50\%$, confirming that also this cluster is mainly populated by fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>The Local Group Symbiotic Star Population and its Tenuous Link with Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are gravitationally bound stellar systems where the evolution of each component can significantly influence the evolution of its companion and the system as a whole. In certain cases, the evolution of these systems can lead to the formation of a red giant-white dwarf system, which may exhibit symbiotic characteristics. The primary goal of this work is to contribute in a statistical way to the estimation of the symbiotic system (SySt) population in the Milky Way and in the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Additionally, we aim to infer the maximum contribution of SySt to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) events. Given the significant discrepancies in previous estimates, we propose two distinct approaches to constrain the expected SySt population: one empirical and another theoretical. These approaches are designed to provide a robust estimation of the SySt population. For the Milky Way, we utilized position and velocity data of known SySts to determine their distribution. Based on these properties, we constrained the lower limit for the Galactic SySt population in the range of 800--4,100. Our theoretical approach, which relies on the properties of zero-age main-sequence binaries and known binary evolutionary paths, suggests a SySt population of $(53\pm6)\times10^3$ SySt in the Galaxy. The statistical SySt populations for LG dwarf galaxies are one to four orders of magnitude lower, primarily dependent on the galaxies' bolometric luminosity and, to a lesser extent, their binary fraction and metallicity. In this work, the contribution of the single-degenerate channel of SNe Ia from symbiotic progenitors is estimated to be of the order of 1\% for the Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FluxCT V2.0, an updated web tool for identifying contaminating flux in Kepler and TESS target pixel files. FluxCT V2.0 focuses on enhancing functionality, user experience, and data processing capabilities. We resolved existing issues to allow for an extended user base, removed known bugs, and extended the tool to any TESS pixel file, allowing the user to search any TESS point object. A batch code for TESS is now available on the companion GitHub. Additional output parameters, such as amplitude dilution and a magnitude cut, have been added to the tool, allowing users more freedom to analyze the possible effects of target sources.</description>

      <title>An MHD Simulation of the Possible Modulations of Stellar CMEs Radio Observations by an Exoplanetary Magnetosphere</title>

Abstract: Type II radio bursts are the indicator of adverse space weather in a stellar system. These radio bursts are the consequence of shock wave acceleration due to the coronal mass ejection (CME). Here, we perform a series of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a CME-driven star-planet system in order to investigate the modulation in radio burst mechanism by a close-in exoplanetary system. We use a model for the stellar wind with a close-in exoplanet, and a CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to generate synthetic radio burst images from our MHD simulations. We find that radio burst like phenomena is most likely to be observed for moderately active solar like stars and close-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence on the nature of radio burst spectrum. We find that when the planetary field is not too strong, the planetary magnetosphere is pushing against the CME, increasing its density so the radio burst is visible at higher frequencies. When the planetary field is very strong, the large magnetosphere does not leave room for the CME shock to evolve so the radio burst is more visible in the lower frequencies associated with the weak compression at the flanks of the CME shock. In case of highly active solar-like stars, strong overlying stellar fields weakens the solar-like CME shock, thus generates very weak (almost non-visible) radio burst signals. For HD 189733 (moderate stellar field), only intensity difference is visible when the CME arrives the planet. We also do not find significant modulation in the radio emission by a close-in exoplanet system when the stellar magnetic field is complex. In summary, our result suggests that the nature of the radio burst spectrum is highly dependent on the topology of the stellar magnetic field and the close-in exoplanetary magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Denoising medium resolution stellar spectra with U-Net convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the use of a U-Net convolutional neural network for denoising simulated medium-resolution spectroscopic observations of stars. Simulated spectra were generated under realistic observational conditions resembling the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). We found that our U-Net model effectively captured spectral features, achieving an average relative error of around $1\%$ across a broad range of stellar parameters, despite a limited training set of only $1000$ observations and a relatively short training period. Although U-Net did not reach the performance previously demonstrated by fully-connected denoising autoencoders (DAEs) consisting of dense layers and trained extensively on larger datasets, it outperformed dense networks trained under similarly constrained conditions. These results indicate that the U-Net architecture offers rapid, robust feature learning and may be particularly advantageous in scenarios involving initial denoising, subsequently refined by more accurate, but otherwise slower deep-learning models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray ionisation of a post-impact early Earth atmosphere: Solar cosmic ray ionisation must be considered in origin-of-life scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CR), both solar and Galactic, have an ionising effect on the Earth's atmosphere and are thought to be important for prebiotic molecule production. In particular, the $\rm{H_2}$-dominated atmosphere following an ocean-vaporising impact is considered favourable to prebiotic molecule formation. We model solar and Galactic CR transport through a post-impact early Earth atmosphere at 200Myr. We aim to identify the differences in the resulting ionisation rates, $\zeta$, particularly at the Earth's surface during a period when the Sun was very active. We use a Monte Carlo model to describe CR transport through the early Earth atmosphere, giving the CR spectra as a function of altitude. We calculate $\zeta$ and the ion-pair production rate, $Q$, as a function of altitude due to Galactic and solar CR. The Galactic and solar CR spectra are both affected by the Sun's rotation rate, $\Omega$, because the solar wind velocity and magnetic field strength both depend on $\Omega$ and influence CR transport. We consider a range of input spectra resulting from the range of possible $\Omega$, from $3.5-15\, \Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. To account for the possibility that the Galactic CR spectrum outside the Solar System varies over Gyr timescales, we compare top-of-atmosphere $\zeta$ resulting from two different scenarios. We also consider the suppression of the CR spectra by a planetary magnetic field. We find that $\zeta$ and $Q$ due to CR are dominated by solar CR in the early Earth atmosphere for most cases. The corresponding $\zeta$ at the early Earth's surface ranges from $5 \times 10^{-21}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 3.5\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$ to $1 \times 10^{-16}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 15\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. Thus if the young Sun was a fast rotator, it is likely that solar CR had a significant effect on the chemistry at the Earth's surface at the time when life is likely to have formed.</description>

      <title>On field line slippage rates in the solar corona</title>

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental dynamical processes in the solar corona. The method of studying reconnection in active region-scale magnetic fields generally depends on non-local methods (i.e. requiring information across the magnetic field under study) of magnetic topology, such as separatrix skeletons and quasi-separatrix layers. The theory of General Magnetic Reconnection is also non-local, in that its measure of the reconnection rate depends on determining the maxima of integrals along field lines. In this work, we complement the above approaches by introducing a local description of magnetic reconnection, that is one in which information about reconnection at a particular location depends only on quantities at that location. This description connects the concept of the field line slippage rate, relative to ideal motion, to the underlying local geometry of the magnetic field characterized in terms of the Lorentz force and field-aligned current density. It is argued that the dominant non-ideal term for the solar corona, discussed in relation to this new description, is mathematically equivalent to the anomalous resistivity employed by many magnetohrdrodynamic simulations. However, the general application of this new approach is adaptable to the inclusion of other non-ideal terms, which may arise from turbulence modelling or the inclusion of a generalized Ohm's law. The approach is illustrated with two examples of coronal magnetic fields related to flux ropes: an analytical model and a nonlinear force-free extrapolation. In terms of the latter, the slippage rate corresponds to the reconnection which would happen if the given (static) force-free equilibrium were the instantaneous form of the magnetic field governed by an Ohm's law with non-ideal terms.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of circumbinary disk accretion on post-AGB binary evolution and surface chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries are surrounded by dusty circumbinary disks, and exhibit unexpected orbital properties resulting from poorly understood binary interaction processes. Re-accreted gas from the circumbinary disk alters the photospheric chemistry of the post-AGB star, producing a characteristic underabundance of refractory elements that correlates with condensation temperature $\unicode{x2013}$a phenomenon known as chemical depletion. This work investigates how re-accretion from a disk drives chemical depletion, and the impact accreted matter has on post-AGB evolution. We used the MESA code to evolve 0.55 and 0.60 M$_{\odot}$ post-AGB stars with the accretion of refractory element-depleted gas from a circumbinary disk. Our study adopts observationally-constrained initial accretion rates and disk masses to reproduce the chemical depletion patterns of six well-studied post-AGB binary stars: EP Lyr, HP Lyr, IRAS 17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933, HD 131356, and SX Cen. We find high accretion rates ($&gt;\,$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and large disk masses ($\geq\,$10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$) necessary to reproduce observed depletion, particularly in higher-mass, hotter post-AGB stars (T$_{\textrm{eff}}\geq$ 6000 K). A slower evolution (lower core mass) is required to reproduce cooler (T$_{\textrm{eff}}\leq$ 5000 K) depleted post-AGB stars. Rapid accretion significantly impacts post-AGB evolution, stalling stars at cooler effective temperatures and extending post-AGB lifetimes by factors of around 3 to 10. Despite this, extended post-AGB timescales remain within or below the planetary nebula (PN) visibility timescale, suggesting accretion cannot account for the observed lack of ionised PNe in post-AGB binaries. Our findings constrain accretion-flow parameters and advance our understanding of disk-binary interactions in post-AGB systems.</description>

      <title>Potential Impact of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy on the Formation of Young O-rich Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way underwent significant transformations in its early history, characterised by violent mergers and satellite galaxy accretion. However, recent observations reveal notable star formation events over the past 4 Gyr, likely triggered by perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Here, we present chemical signatures of this accretion event, using the [Fe/H] (metallicity) and [O/Fe] (oxygen abundance) ratios of thin-disc stars. In the normalised age-metallicity plane, we identify a discontinuous V-shape structure at z$_{\rm max}$ (maximum vertical distance from the disc plane) $&lt;$ 0.4 kpc in the local disc, interrupted by a star formation burst between 4 and 2 Gyr ago. This event is characterised by a significant increase in oxygen abundance, resulting in a distinct [O/Fe] gradient and the formation of young O-rich stars. These stars have larger birth radii, indicating formation in the outer disc followed by radial migration to the Solar neighbourhood. Simulations of late satellite infall suggest that the passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy may have contributed to the observed increase in oxygen abundance in the local disc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present follow-up SCExAO/CHARIS $H$ and $K$-band (R $\sim$ 70) high-contrast integral field spectroscopy and Keck/NIRC2 photometry of directly-imaged brown dwarf companion HD 33632 Ab and new radial-velocity data for the system from the SOPHIE spectrograph, complemented by Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry. These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to lower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the available astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab's spectrum is well reproduced by a field L8.5--L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere models, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity and radius of $T_{\rm eff}$ = 1250 $K$, log(g) = 5, and $R$ = 0.97 $R_{\rm J}$ and a solar C/O ratio. Adding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the companion's orbital properties (e.g. $i$=${47.5}_{-4.7}^{+2.5}$$^{o}$) and dynamical mass (${52.8}_{-2.4}^{+2.6}$$M_{\rm J}$) than derived from imaging data and \textit{Gaia} eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a prime target for multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} and the \textit{Roman Space Telescope}'s Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding detailed light on HD 33632 Ab's clouds and chemistry and providing a key reference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Methods to Characterise Exoplanet Host Stars from Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key to understand exoplanets is characterisation of their host stars. One of the most powerful tools to characterise stellar properties like effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity, is spectroscopy based on observations of stellar atmospheres. This chapter describes the stellar parameters that can be derived from a spectrum with examples of well established methods and theoretical model atmospheres. Combined with photometry and parallax measurements, the outcome of the spectroscopic modelling can be used to derive stellar radii and masses.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Particle Transport at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>The Role of Magnetic Fields in the Formation of High-Mass Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are often invoked as playing a primary role in star formation and in the formation of high-mass stars. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of high-mass cores using the 3-dimensional smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code PHANTOM. We follow the collapse of six molecular clouds of mass 1000 M$_{\odot}$, four of which are initially magnetized with mass-to-flux ratios 3, 5, 10 and 100, respectively, and two purely hydrodynamic clouds with varying initial strengths of turbulence. We then apply an in-house clump-finding algorithm to the 3D SPH data in order to quantify the differences in mass and properties of the cores across the degrees of magnetic and turbulent support. We find that although the magnetic fields cause differences in the global cloud evolution, the masses and properties of the cores which form are broadly similar across the different initial conditions. Cores initially form with masses comparable to the initial thermal Jeans mass of the clouds, and then slowly increase in mass with time. We find that regardless of initial magnetization, the fields become dynamically relevant at densities of $\rho &gt; 1\times10^{-17}$ g cm$^{-3}$ - comparable to core densities - and channel material along the field lines, decreasing the stable magnetic Jeans mass, such that the limiting factor for fragmentation is the thermal Jeans mass. We conclude that magnetic fields are not capable of forming and supporting initially high-mass cores against fragmentation.</description>
