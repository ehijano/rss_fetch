      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This volume contains the proceedings of GandALF 2024, the Fifteenth International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics, and Formal Verification. GandALF 2024 took place on 19-21 June 2024, in Reykjavik, Iceland. The aim of GandALF 2024 is to bring together researchers from academia and industry who are actively working in the fields of Games, Automata, Logics, and Formal Verification. The idea is to cover an ample spectrum of themes, ranging from theory to applications, and stimulate cross-fertilization.

      <title>A relativistic discrete spacetime formulation of 3+1 QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides a relativistic, digital quantum simulation scheme for both $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), based on a discrete spacetime formulation of theory. It takes the form of a quantum circuit, infinitely repeating across space and time, parametrised by the discretization step $\Delta_t=\Delta_x$. Strict causality at each step is ensured as circuit wires coincide with the lightlike worldlines of QED; simulation time under decoherence is optimized. The construction replays the logic that leads to the QED Lagrangian. Namely, it starts from the Dirac quantum walk, well-known to converge towards free relativistic fermions. It then extends the quantum walk into a multi-particle sector quantum cellular automata in a way which respects the fermionic anti-commutation relations and the discrete gauge invariance symmetry. Both requirements can only be achieved at cost of introducing the gauge field. Lastly the gauge field is given its own electromagnetic dynamics, which can be formulated as a quantum walk at each plaquette.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Reactive Strategies Resilient to Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19985v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare games under delayed control and delay games, two types of infinite games modelling asynchronicity in reactive synthesis. In games under delayed control both players suffer from partial informedness due to symmetrically delayed communication, while in delay games, the protagonist has to grant lookahead to the alter player. Our first main result, the interreducibility of the existence of sure winning strategies for the protagonist, allows to transfer known complexity results and bounds on the delay from delay games to games under delayed control, for which no such results had been known. We furthermore analyse existence of randomized strategies that win almost surely, where this correspondence between the two types of games breaks down. In this setting, some games surely won by the alter player in delay games can now be won almost surely by the protagonist in the corresponding game under delayed control, showing that it indeed makes a difference whether the protagonist has to grant lookahead or both players suffer from partial informedness. These results get even more pronounced when we finally address the quantitative goal of winning with a probability in $[0,1]$. We show that for any rational threshold $\theta \in [0,1]$ there is a game that can be won by the protagonist with exactly probability $\theta$ under delayed control, while being surely won by alter in the delay game setting. All these findings refine our original result that games under delayed control are not determined.</description>

      <title>Factoring through monomial representations: arithmetic characterizations and ambiguity of weighted automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize group representations that factor through monomial representations, respectively, block-triangular representations with monomial diagonal blocks, by arithmetic properties. Similar results are obtained for semigroup representations by invertible transformations. The characterizations use results on unit equations from Diophantine number theory (by Evertse, van der Poorten, and Schlickewei in characteristic zero, and by Derksen and Masser in positive characteristic).
  Specialized to finitely generated groups in characteristic zero, one of our main theorems recovers an improvement of a very recent similar characterization by Corvaja, Demeio, Rapinchuk, Ren, and Zannier that was motivated by the study of the bounded generation (BG) property. In positive characteristic, we get a characterization of linear BG groups, recovering a theorem of Ab\'ert, Lubotzky, and Pyber from 2003.
  Our motivation comes from weighted finite automata (WFA) over a field. For invertible WFA we show that $M$-ambiguity, finite ambiguity, and polynomial ambiguity are characterized by arithmetic properties. We discover a full correspondence between arithmetic properties and a complexity hierarchy for WFA based on ambiguity. In the invertible case, this is a far-reaching generalization of a recent result by Bell and the second author, characterizing unambiguous WFA, that resolved a 1979 conjecture of Reutenauer. As a consequence, using the computability of the (linear) Zariski closure of a finitely generated matrix semigroup, the $M$-ambiguity, finite ambiguity, and polynomial ambiguity properties are algorithmically decidable for invertible WFA.</description>

      <title>A formal characterization of discrete condensed objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, proposes a generalization of topology with better categorical properties. It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a condensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf on a certain site of compact Hausdorff spaces. Since condensed sets are supposed to be a generalization of topological spaces, one would like to be able to study the notion of discreteness. There are various ways to define what it means for a condensed set to be discrete. In this paper we describe them, and prove that they are equivalent. The results have been fully formalized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>
