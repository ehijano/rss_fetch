Abstract: Procedural audio, often referred to as "digital Foley", generates sound from scratch using computational processes. It represents an innovative approach to sound-effects creation. However, the development and adoption of procedural audio has been constrained by a lack of publicly available datasets and models, which hinders evaluation and optimization. To address this important gap, this paper presents a dataset of 6000 synthetic audio samples specifically designed to advance research and development in sound synthesis within 30 sound categories. By offering a description of the diverse synthesis methods used in each sound category and supporting the creation of robust evaluation frameworks, this dataset not only highlights the potential of procedural audio, but also provides a resource for researchers, audio developers, and sound designers. This contribution can accelerate the progress of procedural audio, opening up new possibilities in digital sound design.</description>

      <title>QCD Theory meets Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte-Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, we achieve consistency with the theory input and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Hawkes Processes for temporal networks modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks are characterised by interdependent link events between nodes, forming ordered sequences of links that may represent specific information flows in the system. Nevertheless, representing temporal networks using discrete snapshots in time partially cancels the effect of time-ordered links on each other, while continuous time models, such as Poisson or Hawkes processes, can describe the full influence between all the potential pairs of links at all times. In this paper, we introduce a continuous Hawkes temporal network model which accounts both for a community structure of the aggregate network and a strong heterogeneity in the activity of individual nodes, thus accounting for the presence of highly heterogeneous clusters with isolated high-activity influencer nodes, communities and low-activity nodes. Our model improves the prediction performance of previously available continuous time network models, and obtains a systematic increase in log-likelihood. Characterising the direct interaction between influencer nodes and communities, we can provide a more detailed description of the system that can better outline the sequence of activations in the components of the systems represented by temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations. To learn such models from data, a common approach involves sparse selection among a large function library. However, we show that overfitting arises - not just from individual model complexity, but also from the combinatorial growth of possible models. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory to suppress superfluous parameters. PASTIS outperforms existing methods and reliably identifies minimal models, even with low sampling rates or measurement error. It extends to stochastic partial differential equations, and applies to ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Approximation of High-Dimensional Gibbs Distributions with Functional Hierarchical Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical representation of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality manifesting through the intractable normalization constant calculations. This work addresses this challenge by performing a particle-based high-dimensional parametric density estimation subroutine, and the input to the subroutine is Gibbs samples generated by leveraging advanced sampling techniques. Specifically, to generate Gibbs samples, we employ ensemble-based annealed importance sampling, a population-based approach for sampling multimodal distributions. These samples are then processed using functional hierarchical tensor sketching, a tensor-network-based density estimation method for high-dimensional distributions, to obtain the numerical representation of the Gibbs distribution. We successfully apply the proposed approach to complex Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables. In particular, we show that the approach proposed is successful at addressing the metastability issue under difficult numerical cases.</description>
