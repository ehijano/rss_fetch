      <title>Interesting system of $3$ first-order recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we firstly review how to \textit{explicitly} solve a system of $3$ \textit{first-order linear recursions }and outline the main properties of these solutions. Next, via a change of variables, we identify a class of systems of $3$ \textit{first-order nonlinear recursions} which also are \textit{explicitly solvable}. These systems might be of interest for practitioners in \textit{applied} sciences: they allow a complete display of their solutions, which may feature interesting behaviors, for instance be \textit{completely periodic} ("isochronous systems", if the independent variable $n=0,1,2,3...$is considered a \textit{ticking time}), or feature this property \textit{only asymptotically} (as\textit{\ }$n\rightarrow \infty $).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with Lax representations for the three-dimensional Euler--Helmholtz equation. We show that the parameter in the Lax representation from Theorem 3 in [15] is non-removable. Then we present two new Lax representations with non-removable parameters.</description>

      <title>Hietarinta's classification of $4\times 4$ constant Yang-Baxter operators using algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying Yang-Baxter operators is an essential first step in the study of the simulation of integrable quantum systems on quantum computers. One of the earliest initiatives was taken by Hietarinta in classifying constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). He obtained 11 families of invertible solutions, including the one generated by the permutation operator. While these methods work well for 4 by 4 solutions, they become cumbersome for higher dimensional representations. In this work, we overcome this restriction by constructing the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent manner by using ans\"{a}tze from algebraic structures. We use four different algebraic structures that reproduce 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families when the qubit representation is chosen. The methods include a set of commuting operators, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and partition algebras. We do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class with these methods.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Deformations of (Semi-)Symmetric Space Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the auxiliary field deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) introduced in arXiv:2405.05899 and arXiv:2407.16338 to sigma models whose target manifolds are symmetric or semi-symmetric spaces, including a Wess-Zumino term in the latter case. This gives rise to a new infinite family of classically integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ coset models of the form which are of interest in applications of integrability to worldsheet string theory and holography. We demonstrate that every theory in this infinite class admits a zero-curvature representation for its equations of motion by exhibiting a Lax connection.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions of the six-vertex IRF model and its quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the interaction-round-a-face version of the isotropic six-vertex model. The associated spin chain is made of two coupled Heisenberg spin chains with different boundary twists. The phase diagram of the model and the long distance correlations were studied in [Nucl. Phys. B, 995 (2023) 116333]. Here, we compute the short-distance correlation functions of the model in the ground state for finite system sizes via non-linear integral equations and in the thermodynamic limit. This was possible since the model satisfies the face version of the discrete quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equation. A suitable ansatz for the density matrix is proposed in the form of a direct sum of two Heisenberg density matrices, which allows us to obtain the discrete functional equation for the two-site function $\omega(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$. Thanks to the known results on the factorization of correlation functions of the Heisenberg chain, we are able to compute the density matrix of the IRF model for up to four sites and its associated spin chain for up to three sites.</description>

      <title>Extended symmetry of higher Painlev\'e equations of even periodicity and their rational solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of extended affine Weyl symmetry group of higher Painlev\'e equations of $N$ periodicity depends on whether $N$ is even or odd. We find that for even $N$, the symmetry group ${\widehat A}^{(1)}_{N-1}$ contains the conventional B\"acklund transformations $s_j, j=1,{\ldots},N$, the group of automorphisms consisting of cycling permutations but also reflections on a periodic circle of $N$ points, which is a novel feature uncovered in this paper.
  The presence of reflection automorphisms is connected to existence of degenerated solutions and for $N=4$ we explicitly show how the reflection automorphisms around even points cause degeneracy of a class of rational solutions obtained on the orbit of translation operators of ${\widehat A}^{(1)}_{3}$. We obtain the closed expressions for solutions and their degenerated counterparts in terms of determinants of Kummer polynomials.</description>

      <title>Burgers turbulence in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove analytically and show numerically that the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain is characterised by a transient Burgers turbulence regime on a wide range of time and energy scales. This regime is present at long wavelengths and energy per particle small enough that equipartition is not reached on a fast time scale. In this range, we prove that the driving mechanism to thermalisation is the formation of a shock that can be predicted using a pair of generalised Burgers equations. We perform a perturbative calculation at small energy per particle, proving that the energy spectrum of the chain $E_k$ decays as a power law, $E_k\sim k^{-\zeta(t)}$, on an extensive range of wavenumbers $k$. We predict that $\zeta(t)$ takes first the value $8/3$ at the Burgers shock time, and then reaches a value close to $2$ within two shock times. The value of the exponent $\zeta=2$ persists for several shock times before the system eventually relaxes to equipartition. During this wide time-window, an exponential cut-off in the spectrum is observed at large $k$, in agreement with previous results. Such a scenario turns out to be universal, i.e. independent of the parameters characterising the system and of the initial condition, once time is measured in units of the shock time.</description>

      <title>An integrable pseudospherical equation with pseudo-peakon solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an integrable equation whose solutions define a triad of one-forms describing a surface with Gaussian curvature -1. We identify a local group of diffeomorphisms that preserve these solutions and establish conserved quantities. From the symmetries, we obtain invariant solutions that provide explicit metrics for the surfaces. These solutions are unbounded and often appear in mirrored pairs. We introduce the ``collage'' method, which uses conserved quantities to remove unbounded parts and smoothly join the solutions, leading to weak solutions consistent with the conserved quantities. As a result we get pseudo-peakons, which are smoother than Camassa-Holm peakons. Additionally, we apply a Miura-type transformation to relate our equation to the Degasperis-Procesi equation, allowing us to recover peakon and shock-peakon solutions for it from the solutions of the other equation.</description>
