      <title>Spin-dependent quasiparticle lifetimes in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate many-body effects on the spin-split electron bands in altermagnets by computing the electron self-energy arising from interactions with magnons, phonons, and hybridized magnon-phonon modes. These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states.</description>

      <title>Anyon Dispersion in Aharonov-Casher Bands and Implications for Twisted MoTe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in two-dimensional heterostructures has opened the door to realizing phases of dispersing anyons. Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Classifying one-dimensional Floquet phases through two-dimensional topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet systems display rich phenomena, such as time crystals, with many-body localisation (MBL) protecting the phases from heating. While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Extracting Anyon Statistics from Neural Network Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states host emergent anyons with exotic exchange statistics, but obtaining direct access to their topological properties in real systems remains a challenge. Neural-network wavefunctions provide a flexible computational approach, as they can represent highly correlated states without requiring a tailored basis. Here we use the neural-network variational Monte Carlo method to study the fractional quantum Hall effect on the torus and find the three degenerate ground states at filling factor nu=1/3. From these, we extract the modular S matrix via entanglement interferometry, a technique previously only applied to lattice models. The resulting S matrix encodes the quantum dimensions, fusion rules, and exchange statistics of the emergent anyons, providing a direct numerical demonstration of the topological order. The calculated anyon properties match the well-known theoretical and experimental results. Our work establishes neural-network wavefunctions as a powerful new tool for investigating anyonic properties.</description>

      <title>Imaging Electron-Hole Asymmetry in the Quantum Melting of Generalized Wigner Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e materials provide a versatile platform to explore phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have imaged the density-driven melting of generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) and Mott insulators (MIs) in electron-doped, near-60{\deg} twisted MoSe2 bilayers featuring a triangular moir\'e superlattice. We observe striking electron-hole asymmetry in GWC melting: hole-doped GWCs yield interaction-driven disordered states whereas electron-doped GWCs melt into delocalized liquid-like states. This asymmetry arises from the broken particle-hole symmetry of the moir\'e superlattice, which produces electron and hole Fermi pockets with different momentum geometries upon GWC condensation. MI states melt without such asymmetry, consistent with the absence of a symmetry-breaking density modulation. This work provides direct visualization of the novel emergent phases that appear as GWCs undergo quantum melting transitions.</description>

      <title>Recent progress in quantum spin liquids, fractional magnetization plateaus, and unconventional superconductivity in kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its unique geometric structure, has emerged as a leading platform for exploring quantum many-body physics, particularly in the study of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) and unconventional superconductivity. This review highlights recent advancements in the investigations of QSLs, fractional magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets, and unconventional superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome superconductors. We begin by examining the classical ground-state properties of the nearest-neighbor kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and introducing recent experimental progress in the study of QSLs and fractional magnetization plateau phases. Next, we discuss the fermionic description of the QSL states, along with related gauge theory and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. We then focus on discussing the VMC studies of QSLs and magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets. For superconductivity in kagome systems, we first analyze the characteristics of the electronic structure and the possible associated electronic instabilities. Finally, we review recent experimental advances in unconventional superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), with a particular focus on chiral superconductivity and pairing density waves.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Suppression of Phonon Thermal Transport by Magnetic Excitations in a Molecular Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present large-scale ab initio phonon calculations for the molecular quantum spin liquid X[Pd(dmit)2]2. An unusually low average phonon velocity ( 700 {m/s}) and optical modes below 10 cm^{-1} confine the Debye T^{3} regime to T &lt; 2 K. As the transfer-integral anisotropy approaches the maximally frustrated regime (t'/t \to 1), the lattice stiffens, ruling out lattice softening as the origin of the spin-liquid state. By quantifying the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity from experimental data, we observe a power-law behavior consistent with two-dimensional magnetic excitations with a nodal, approximately linear (Dirac-like) spectrum.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Phases in an Organic One-Dimensional Mott Chain: Odd-Haldane (S = 1/2) and Haldane (S = 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with interactions in chemically realistic systems remains an open challenge. We show that a single, synthetically plausible organic one-dimensional chain, tunable via chemical modification of its radical sites, hosts two such phases: an odd-Haldane phase of a dimerized $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain and a Haldane phase of an $S=1$ chain realized when Hund coupling locks two $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$ spins per monomer into $S=1$. Density-functional theory places the active manifold deep in the Mott regime ($U/t\!\approx\!126$), justifying a spin-only Heisenberg description; a compact $(t,U)\!\to\!J$ mapping then fixes exchange couplings. Exact diagonalization and DMRG reveal a consistent SPT fingerprint across both phases, including a quantized many-body Zak phase, even-degenerate entanglement spectrum, protected edge spins, and characteristic triplon/Haldane features in $S^{+-}(q,\omega)$. Our results identify a chemically programmable molecular platform for interacting SPT physics in one dimension and suggest concrete spectroscopic routes to organic Haldane spin chains for nanoscale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale control of substrate-spin coupling via vertical manipulation of a 2D metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with frustrated crystal geometries can host strongly correlated electrons, potentially leading to a range of exotic many-body quantum phases such as Mott insulators, quantum spin-liquids, and Kondo lattices. The ability to control exchange-coupling within these systems is therefore highly desirable. Here, we use an atomically sharp scanning tunneling microscope probe to vertically manipulate a 2D Mott insulating kagome metal-organic framework (MOF) featuring Kondo-screened local magnetic moments on Ag(111). We show that by controlling the adsorption height of the MOF, we can also controllably and reversibly change the strength of Kondo coupling between the MOF's local spins and the substrate's conduction electrons. This mechanical control of Kondo coupling could be extended to other forms of interlayer exchange coupling, potentially allowing for atomic-scale design or control of spintronics technologies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-induced insulating behavior in black phosphorus under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the out-of-plane magnetoresistance of pressurized black phosphorus (BP) with a longitudinal field configuration. Despite the absence of the Lorentz force in the present configuration, we observed a significant enhancement of magnetoresistance marked with a clear onset field in both the semiconducting (1.1 GPa) and semimetallic (1.3 GPa) phases. The insulating behavior observed near the semiconductor-semimetal transitio pressure is possibly associated with emergence of an excitonic phase, which has been suggested in a recent theoretical study. BP under finely tuned pressure can be a candidate to realize the field-induced electronic phase transition in a moderate magnetic field below 9 T.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Strain Modulated Correlated Plasmons in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and Their Role in High-temperature Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-modulated $\Gamma$ valley in twisted bilayer and twisted double-bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ hosts intriguing correlated quantum phenomena including the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted bilayer (t-BL) MoTe$_2$ near 3.7$^\circ$, which is sensitive to the twist angle and moir\'e superlattices. Here, we directly visualize the twist-angle-modulated electronic structure of t-BL and twisted double-bilayer (t-DBL) near this critical angle. We find that the moir\'e superlattice not only modifies the relative energy between $\Gamma$ and K valleys in t-BL MoTe$_2$, but also strongly reconstructs the $\Gamma$ valley for both t-BL and t-DBL. Specifically, the deep $p_z$-derived band at $\Gamma$ exhibits a distinct splitting that systematically varies with increasing twist angle. Theoretical analysis suggests that this modulation arises from the twist-angle-dependent lattice relaxation, especially interfacial corrugations. Our work directly visualizes the moir\'e-modulated electronic structure and provides key spectroscopic information of lattice relaxation and interlayer interactions underlying the physics of twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases</description>

      <title>Hyperfine coupling in singlet ground state magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins and of their quadrupolar splitting on the induced moment order in singlet ground state magnets is investigated. The latter are found among non-Kramers f electron compounds. Without coupling to the nuclear spins these magnets have a quantum critical point (QCP) separating paramagnetic and induced moment regime. The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. It is shown that the three peak structure in the electronic induced moment regime gradually changes to a two-peak structure in the hyperfine coupling dominated nuclear moment order regime or for increasing field strength. Most importantly the possibility of a reentrance behaviour of magnetic order or likewise nonmonotonic critical fields due to hyperfine coupling influence is demonstrated. Finally the systematic evolution of the phase diagram under the influence of nuclear quadrupole coupling is clarified.</description>

      <title>Theory of exciton polarons in 2D Wigner crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a platform for realizing Wigner crystals and enable their detection via exciton spectroscopy. We develop a microscopic theoretical model for excitons interacting with the localized electrons of the Wigner crystal, including their vibrational motion. In addition to the previously observed exciton-Umklapp feature, the theory reproduces and explains the higher-band attractive-polaron resonances recently reported experimentally. Our model further uncovers that the appearance of two equal-strength and parallel attractive polarons, as commonly observed in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, is a signature of strong correlations in the electronic system. Altogether, our results demonstrate that accounting for electronic interactions is essential to reproduce and interpret the exciton-polaron spectra of TMDs.</description>

      <title>Strain-Controlled Magnetic Phase Transitions through Anisotropic Exchange Interactions: A Combined DFT and Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain provides a powerful, non-chemical route to tune the properties of functional materials by manipulating the coupling between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and $\rm BiFeO_3$ as a model system, we first demonstrate how epitaxial strain exactly leads to anisotropic magnetic interactions where the exchange coupling along the $c$-axis differs from that in the $ab$-plane. We show that subtle structural modifications, specifically the distortion from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice, drive a magnetic phase transition from a G-type to a C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. The anisotropy in magnetic interactions, which becomes prominent in the lower symmetry tetragonal phase, provides a direct link between the structural distortion and the potential change in magnetic ordering. For a more comprehensive study, we next investigate the role of strain in driving magnetic phase transitions within a half-filled one-band Hubbard model in three dimensions. In this framework, strain is introduced through anisotropic hopping processes between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites, inspired by the DFT calculations. Using a semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) approach, we construct ground state phase diagrams in the nonperturbative regime, which show how uniaxial strain stabilizes distinct magnetic ground states: Compressive strain drives a transition from a G-type to a C-type AF insulator, whereas tensile strain suppresses the C-type AF order, favoring an A-type AF phase. Overall, our combined DFT and s-MC calculations highlight that strain is a powerful tuning parameter for controlling competing magnetic phases by governing exchange coupling mechanisms in correlated systems, offering valuable insights for the design of strain-controlled materials.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of CoNb$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advances in terahertz (THz) sources and detection, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which allows to probe nonlinear responses in a two-frequency plane, now reaches the meV regime relevant for quasiparticle excitations in magnetic materials. This opens a promising route to reveal many-body phenomena that evade linear-response probes. To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our results provide concrete predictions and clear targets for future THz 2DCS experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Optimal array geometries for kinetic magnetism and Nagaoka polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dot (QD) platforms have enabled the direct observation of Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NFM) in small arrays and non-infinite interaction strength. However, optimizing the cluster connectivity characteristics that yield a ground state with maximal spin and their robustness against magnetic fields remains unexplored. Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\simeq \lambda_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $\lambda_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $\pi$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($\lambda_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system.</description>

      <title>Revival Dynamics from Equilibrium States: Scars from Chords in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz violation and thermal Hall effect in kagome metal TbCr6Ge6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful probe of exotic excitations in correlated quantum materials, providing access to charge-neutral heat carriers that remain invisible to electrical transport. To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = \kappa_{xx,xy} / (T \sigma_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range.</description>

      <title>An exciton interacting with the phonons of an electronic Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials, a two-dimensional electronic Wigner crystal has recently been observed. The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton.</description>

      <title>Determining the superconducting order parameter of UPt$_3$ using scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity, a state in which electrical currents can flow without resistance, occurs because of pairing of electrons into quasiparticles with integer spin $S$. In practically all known superconducting materials, these pairs form a singlet with $S=0$. Finding a material that has triplet pairing, $S=1$, would have profound fundamental and technological implications. UPt$_3$ has been a key candidate material for spin-triplet superconductivity. Because of a lack of direct evidence for the pairing symmetry, the nature of the superconducting pairing remains under debate. Here, we use ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to resolve this question. Our data reveals a zero-bias Andreev bound state within the gap for a surface normal to the $c$-axis of UPt$_3$. The superconducting origin of the features is confirmed through vortex imaging. For triplet pairing, such an Andreev state is fragile against Rashba spin-splitting, whereas for singlet pairing it remains robust, classifying UPt$_3$ as a spin-singlet superconductor with a chiral order parameter.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar and dipolar phases of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium thermoelectric and spectral properties of a double quantum dot system are investigated, with the geometry continuously tuned from series to parallel via a parameter $ p $. Within the non-crossing approximation in the infinite-$ U $ limit, the Kondo peak remains robust, while satellite features and the Kondo temperature show strong sensitivity to the geometry. The Seebeck coefficient exhibits sign reversals and non-monotonic behavior as a result of the interplay between Kondo and satellite peaks. These findings underscore the role of interference and coupling asymmetry in governing transport properties, suggesting routes for geometry-based optimization in nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilization and effect of A-site ionic size in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has sparked a surge of research into Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates. Currently, stabilizing the bilayer RP phases with smaller $A$-site ions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Orbital-related gyrotropic responses in Cu$_2$WSe$_4$ and chirality indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, counterparts of phenomena studied in spintronics have been actively explored in the orbital sector. The relationship between orbital degrees of freedom and crystal chirality has also been intensively investigated, although the distinction from gyrotropic properties has not been fully clarified. In this work, we investigate spin and orbital Edelstein effects as well as the nonlinear responses in the ternary transition-metal chalcogenide Cu$_2$WSe$_4$, which has a gyrotropic but achiral crystal structure. We find that in the Edelstein effect, magnetization is dominated by the orbital contribution rather than the spin contribution. On the other hand, both the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric (NCTE) Hall effect--a response to the cross product of the electric field and the temperature gradient--and the nonlinear Hall effect--conventional second-order response to the electric field--are found to be dominated by the Berry curvature dipole. We further find that spin-orbit coupling plays only a minor role in these effects, whereas the orbital degrees of freedom are essential. Finally, we demonstrate that the orbital magnetic-moment contributions to both the Edelstein effect and the NCTE Hall effect are closely linked to chirality, and we discuss the possibility of using them as a chirality indicator.</description>

      <title>Charge order in the Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ from high-field Hall effect measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of doping in the composite Pr$_x$Y$_{1-x}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (Pr-YBCO) system is distinct from that of pure YBCO, offering a means to explore the requirements for the numerous electronic orders appearing in the phase diagram. One such example is the ubiquitous 2D charge order and concomitant Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped YBCO. Here, using magnetotransport and Hall effect measurements, we find signatures of a Fermi surface reconstruction similar to that in pure YBCO indicating the presence of 2D charge order in Pr-YBCO. Additionally, we find that the phase diagrams of Pr-YBCO and YBCO are decidedly symmetric despite the additional disorder in the former and the distinction between hole depletion through Pr substitution and through O reduction. This indicates that while the mechanism of doping differs, the amount of charge carriers in the planes is the most important factor governing the electronic orders in these systems.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy and Renormalization Group Flow Irreversibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study holographic c-theorems based on timelike entanglement entropy and show that a timelike c-function captures irreversible renormalization group (RG) flow. We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Wigner crystal polarons in an atomically thin semiconductor</title>

Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in two-dimensional systems can spontaneously break translational symmetry, forming a periodic Wigner crystal. Although these crystals have been realized in several platforms, experimental studies of their collective many-body excitations in the absence of a magnetic field remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we access this regime optically by uncovering Wigner crystal polarons: novel light-matter excitations arising from the dressing of excitons by collective excitations of the Wigner crystal. These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions. These novel many-body excitations provide an optical interface to the spin state of the Wigner crystal, which as we demonstrate, can be controlled both magnetically and optically. Our work establishes layered materials as a unique platform for exploring dynamical impurity dressing by strongly correlated electronic orders.</description>

Abstract: Wigner crystals, lattices made purely of electrons, are a quintessential paradigm of studying correlation-driven quantum phase transitions. Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable tests of quantum contextuality from stabilizer-testing nonlocal games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific "stabilizer-testing" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* &lt; 1$, then $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* \leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.</description>

      <title>Many-body contextuality and self-testing quantum matter via nonlocal games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted high throughput prediction of moir\'e materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world of 2D materials is rapidly expanding with new discoveries of stackable and twistable layered systems composed of lattices of different symmetries, orbital character, and structural motifs. Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Multichannel active-space embedding of atomic multiplets in plane-wave DFT/PAW for core-level spectroscopies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04690v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an active-space embedding framework for core-level spectroscopies that connects localized atomic multiplets to continuum resonances within a plane-wave DFT/PAW description. The approach is complementary to widely used core-level Bethe--Salpeter implementations based on a two-particle (core-exciton) picture with typically static screening: here a correlated multiplet manifold of the absorber (including the core hole and open-shell configurations) is coherently coupled to a plane-wave photoelectron, enabling a unified treatment of localized multiplet structure and continuum lineshapes. Spectra are computed in a general time-domain formulation equivalent to Fermi's golden rule: a transition operator tailored to the specific spectroscopy technique is applied to the correlated ground state to generate an excited wavepacket, and the corresponding wavepacket autocorrelation function is evaluated without explicit real-time propagation, using Lanczos tridiagonalization or the kernel polynomial method; the spectral intensity follows from its Fourier representation. We validate the method at the Ce \(N_{4,5}\) edges, reproducing in quantitative agreement with experiment both high-\(Q\) multiplet features and the low-\(Q\) giant dipole resonance continuum, including a characteristic low-energy shoulder relevant for robust Ce valence assignments. The implementation is available open-source within the Quantum ESPRESSO XSPECTRA package (xspectruplet mode), together with reproducible inputs and scripts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.</description>

      <title>A sine-square deformation approach to quantum critical points in one-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that "if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.</description>

Abstract: We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fr\"ohlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Materials that have zero-energy flat band states on the surface may show surface superconductivity. Here we report a theoretical observation that a Hamiltonian describing a thin slab of topological nodal line semimetal, has zero energy eigenstate spanning the entire surface of the Brillouin zone under certain conditions, namely (i) the hopping amplitude of fermions in the direction of thickness is more than that in other directions (ii) the onsite energy should be less than some limiting value determined by the hopping probability. Our claim is substantiated by analytic and numerical approach. We also report new phase transitions in a region of parameter space and indicate that the Hamiltonian can also be realised by stacked layers described by a suitable Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U&gt;0$ and $t&gt;0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</description>

      <title>Kondo effect under arbitrary spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.</description>

      <title>Model of dark current in silicon-based barrier impurity band infrared detector devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Hall Phase in the Truncated Trihexagonal Lattice: A Topological Archimedean Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekul\'e ordering in moir\'e graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekul\'e modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</description>

      <title>Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Changes in Structure, Magnetic Order and Development of Superconductivity in the Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi8Te13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n &lt; 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</description>
