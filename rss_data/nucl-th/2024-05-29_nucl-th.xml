      <title>Heavy-Ion Collisions as Probes of Nuclear Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a model-to-data comparison for U+U and Au+Au collisions performed at RHIC at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = $193$ GeV and $200$ GeV, using a multistage framework. Model calculations for various configurations of $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au are used to compare with measurements of $\rho(v_n\{2\}^2,\left\langle p_T \right\rangle)$, the elliptic-flow-momentum correlator, for the first time. It is found that momentum-flow correlations measured in high-energy nuclear collisions, combined with the flow harmonics themselves, are excellent probes of nuclear deformation and of nuclear structure in general.</description>

      <title>Strange quark stars: the role of excluded volume effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cold strange quark stars employing an enhanced version of the quark-mass density-dependent model which incorporates excluded volume effects to address non-perturbative QCD repulsive interactions. We provide a comparative analysis of our mass formula parametrization with previous models from the literature. We identify the regions within the parameter space where three-flavor quark matter is more stable than the most tightly bound atomic nucleus (stability window). Specifically, we show that excluded volume effects do not change the Gibbs free energy per baryon at zero pressure, rendering the stability window unaffected. The curves of pressure versus energy density exhibit various shapes -- convex upward, concave downward, or nearly linear -- depending on the mass parametrization. This behavior results in different patterns of increase, decrease, or constancy in the speed of sound as a function of baryon number density. We analyze the mass-radius relationship of strange quark stars, revealing a significant increase in maximum gravitational mass and a shift in the curves towards larger radii as the excluded volume effect intensifies. Excluded volume effects render our models compatible with all modern astrophysical constraints, including the properties of the recently observed low-mass compact object HESSJ1731.</description>

      <title>Construction of continuous collective energy landscapes for large amplitude nuclear many-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several protocols are proposed to build continuous energy surfaces of many-body quantum systems, regarding both energy and states. The standard variational principle is augmented with constraints on state overlap, ensuring arbitrary precision on continuity. As an illustration, the lowest energy and excited state paths relevant for the $^{240}$Pu asymmetric fission are studied. The scission is clearly signed, with a neutron excess in the neck, the ultimate glue before its rupture. Our approach can potentially connect any couple of Hilbert space states, which opens up new horizons for various applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of the radial profile of atomic nuclei on observables in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heavy-ion phenomenology, the nucleon density distribution in colliding nuclei is commonly described by a two-parameter Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. However, this approach omits the detailed radial structure in the density distribution that arises from quantal filling patterns of neutrons and protons. These fine structures, as estimated by the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock density functional, cause small deviations in heavy-ion observables from the WS baseline, which cannot be captured by simply readjusting the WS parameters. These deviations are dependent on centrality and observable but often exhibit similar shapes for different nuclei. Such fine structures may introduce up to a 25% uncertainty in the measured differences in heavy-ion observables between the $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr mid-central collisions from the STAR Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Neutron Data Evaluation of 243Am</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diverse measured data base of n+243Am was evaluated using a statistical theory and genera-lized least squares codes. Consistent description of total, capture and fission measured data provides an important constraint for the inelastic scattering cross section. Important constraints for the measured capture cross section in the 0.15-300 keV energy range come from the average radiative and neutron S0 and S1 strength functions. The evaluated inelastic cross sections of available evaluations are in severe disagreement, predicted change of the inelastic cross section shape at En ~1.5 MeV is attributed to the sharp increase of the level density of the residual odd-even nuclide 241Am due to the onset of three-quasi-particle excitations. The influence of exclusive (n, xnf) pre-fission neutrons on prompt fission neutron spectra (PFNS) and (n, xn) spectra is modelled. Contributions of emissive/non-emissive fission and exclusive spectra of (n, xnf) reactions are defined by a consistent description of the 241Am(n, F), 241Am(n, 2n).

      <title>Adiabatic Hydrodynamization and the Emergence of Attractors: a Unified Description of Hydrodynamization in Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Attractor" solutions for the pre-hydrodynamic, far-from-equilibrium, evolution of the matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions have emerged as crucial descriptors of the rapid hydrodynamization of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Adiabatic Hydrodynamization (AH) has been proposed as a framework with which to describe, explain, and predict attractor behavior that draws upon an analogy to the adiabatic approximation in quantum mechanics. In this work, we systematize the description of pre-hydrodynamic attractors in kinetic theory by showing how to use the AH framework to identify these long-lived solutions to which varied initial conditions rapidly evolve, demonstrating the robustness of this framework. In a simplified QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle scattering limit, we use AH to explain both the early- and late-time scaling behavior of a longitudinally expanding gluon gas in a unified framework. In this context, we show that AH provides a unified description of, and intuition for, all the stages of what in QCD would be bottom-up thermalization, starting from a pre-hydrodynamic attractor and ending with hydrodynamization. We additionally discuss the connection between the notions of scaling behavior and adiabaticity and the crucial role of time-dependent coordinate redefinitions in identifying the degrees of freedom of kinetic theories that give rise to attractor solutions. The tools we present open a path to the intuitive explanation of how attractor behavior arises and how the attractor evolves in all stages of the hydrodynamization of QGP in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ photoproduction: threshold to very high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ photoproduction, which exposes the $c \bar c$ content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to c\bar c + \mathbb P \to J/\psi$ and couples the intermediate $c \bar c$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P $) exchange, is used to deliver a description of available data, viz. both differential and total cross sections from near threshold, where data has newly been acquired, to invariant mass $W \approx 300\,$GeV. The study suggests that it is premature to link existing $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are necessary before the validity of any such connections can be assessed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A global Bayesian analysis of relativistic Pb + Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN}$ = 2.76 TeV is performed, using a multistage model consisting of an IP-Glasma initial state, a viscous fluid dynamical evolution, and a hadronic transport final state. The observables considered are from the soft sector hadronic final state. Posterior and Maximum a Posteriori parameter distributions that pertain to the IP-Glasma and hydrodynamic phases are obtained, including the shear and bulk specific viscosity of strong interacting matter. The first use of inference with transfer learning in heavy-ion analyses is presented, together with Bayes Model Averaging.</description>

      <title>Isospin-dependent in-medium nucleon-Delta elastic cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies, the production and propagation of $\Delta$ particles are crucial to understanding the nuclear equation of state and inferring the properties of nuclear matter at high densities. Based on the self-consistent relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (RBUU) transport theory, by introducing the isovector $\rho$ meson exchange into the effective Lagrangian and adopting the density-dependent coupling constants, the detailed expressions for isospin-dependent in-medium $N\Delta\rightarrow N\Delta$ elastic cross sections $\sigma_{N\Delta}^{*}$ have been calculated. The energy and density dependence of the isospin-related $\sigma_{N\Delta}^{*}$ as well as the total contributions of $\sigma$, $\omega$ and $\rho$ meson fields are analyzed. It is found that the total $\sigma_{N\Delta}^{*}$ has a sensitive center-of-mass energy dependence at lower energies while exhibiting a slight increase as the center-of-mass energy increases. The isospin effect between different isospin-separated channels weakens as the energy and/or density increases. The isospin effect on the density- and energy-dependent in-medium $N\Delta$ elastic cross sections is dominantly caused by the delicate balance of the isovector $\rho$ meson exchange.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations are crucial in describing dynamics of many particle systems. We present a quantum imaginary time evolution (ITE) algorithm as a solution to such equations in the case of nuclear Hartree-Fock equations. Under a simplified Skyrme interaction model, we calculate the ground state energy of an oxygen-16 nucleus and demonstrate that the result is in agreement with the classical ITE algorithm.</description>

      <title>Baryons as Vortexes on the $\eta^{\prime}$ Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recent construction of $N_f=1$ baryons on the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall can be understood as vortexes of the principal effective theory -- the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory -- on a 2+1-dimensional sheet. This theory has a series of vertex solutions, and the vortex with unit topological charge naturally spins $N_c/2$, which coincides with the spin of the one-flavor baryon in QCD. Since the $N_c$ scaling of the vortexes is the same as that of baryons, baryons can be regarded as vortexes. By virtue of the particle-vortex symmetry, the dual Zhang-Hansson-Kivelson theory indicates that the quark carries topological charge $1/N_c$ and obeys fractional statistics. The generalization to arbitrary $N_f$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Influence on Quarkyonic Stars: A Relativistic Mean Field Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formulation of quarkyonic matter consists of treating both quarks and nucleons as quasi-particles, where a cross-over transition occurs between the two phases. This work is based upon some of the early ideas of quark matter. It can satisfy the different observational constraints on the neutron star (NS), such as its maximum mass and the canonical radius. In addition, we put an extra component inside the NS known as Dark Matter (DM) because it is trapped due to its immense gravitational potential. In this work, we explore the impact of fermionic DM on the structure of the NS. The equation of state (EOS) is derived for the NS with the quarkyonic matter by assuming that nucleons and quarks are in equilibrium, followed by the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism. The recently modeled two parameterizations, such as G3 and IOPB-I, are taken to calculate the various macroscopic properties of the NS. The three unknown parameters such as the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm sc}$), and the DM Fermi momentum ($k_f^{\rm DM}$) are varied to obtain the NS properties. The quarkyonic matter stiffens the EOS while DM softens it. The mutual combination provides us with good theoretical predictions for the magnitude of macroscopic properties consistent with the different observational results. Also, one can estimate the parameters of the DM admixed quarkyonic star with different statistical analyses, which can be further used to explore the other properties of the quarkyonic star.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes my personal appreciation for some of the great research achievements of Mitya Diakonov, Vitya Petrov, and Maxim Polyakov and how my own research career has followed the paths they opened. Among the topics where they have been the most influential have been the pursuit and study of the exotic pentaquark. The search for exotics may require a complementary approach, such as experimental and theoretical activity. Here, I would like to focus on a story of $N(1680)$ in which I was involved.</description>
