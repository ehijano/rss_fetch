      <title>DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis, and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer, a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</description>

      <title>DeepRetro: Retrosynthetic Pathway Discovery using Iterative LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.</description>

      <title>Positive equilibria in mass action networks: geometry and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results on the geometry of the positive equilibrium set of a mass action network. Any mass action network gives rise to a parameterised family of polynomial equations whose positive solutions are the positive equilibria of the network. Here, we start by deriving alternative systems of equations, whose solutions are in smooth, one-to-one correspondence with positive equilibria of the network, and capture degeneracy or nondegeneracy of the corresponding equilibria. The derivation leads us to consider partitions of networks in a natural sense, and we explore the implications of choosing different partitions. The alternative systems are often simpler than the original mass action equations, sometimes giving explicit parameterisations of positive equilibria, and allowing us to rapidly identify various algebraic and geometric properties of the positive equilibrium set, including toricity and local toricity. We can use the approaches we develop to bound the number of positive nondegenerate equilibria on stoichiometric classes; to derive semialgebraic descriptions of the parameter regions for multistationarity; and to study bifurcations. We present the main construction, various consequences for particular classes of networks, and numerous examples. We also develop additional techniques specifically for quadratic networks, the most common class of networks in applications, and use these techniques to derive strengthened results for quadratic networks.</description>

      <title>Identifying the sources of noise synergy and redundancy in the gene expression of feed-forward loop motif</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of noise through parallel regulatory pathways is a characteristic feature of feed-forward loops in genetic networks. Although the contributions of the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward loops to output variability have been well characterized, the impact of their joint action arising from their shared input and output remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an additional component of noise that emerges specifically from this convergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene correlations, we reveal the regulatory basis of the cross-interaction noise and interpret it as synergy or redundancy in noise propagation, depending on whether the combined pathways amplify or suppress fluctuations. Synergy typically arises in coherent feed-forward loops, whereas redundancy is common in incoherent ones. This framework not only accounts for previously observed differences in noise behavior across coherent and incoherent structures but also provides a generalizable strategy to connect network structure with stochastic gene regulation. Furthermore, by relating these synergy and redundancy to dynamical properties such as sign-sensitive delay or response acceleration, the framework offers a statistical lens to interpret the functional roles in cellular decision-making.</description>

      <title>The optimization of crop response to climatic stress through modulation of plant stress response mechanisms. Opportunities for biostimulants and plant hormones to meet climate challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01714</link>

Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.</description>
