      <title>Super-Size Me: The Big Multi-AGN Catalog (The Big MAC), Data Release 1: The Source Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers represent the most transformative and dramatic avenue for galaxy and supermassive black hole (SMBH) evolution. Multi-active galactic nuclei (multi-AGNs) are expected to ignite, grow, and evolve alongside the host galaxies, and these represent different evolutionary stages of the SMBHs over the merger sequence. However, no comprehensive census exists of observed multi-AGN systems. Here we present The Big Multi-AGN Catalog (The Big MAC), the first literature-complete catalog of all known (confirmed and candidate) multi-AGN systems, which includes dual AGNs (separations $\sim0.03-110$ kpc), binary AGNs (gravitationally bound, $\lesssim30$ pc), recoiling AGNs, and N-tuple AGNs (involving three or more AGNs), gleaned from hundreds of literature articles spanning the years 1970-2020. The Big MAC is the first archive to assemble all multi-AGN systems and candidates across all selection methods, redshifts, and galaxy mass ratios, and this catalog offers a solid foundation for archival and targeted multiwavelength follow-up investigations. In this work, we provide an overview of the creation of the multi-AGN literature library and the catalog itself, present definitions for different multi-AGN classes (including new definitions for dual AGNs derived from galaxy pairs in Illustris-TNG100), describe the general properties of the catalog as a function of redshift space and separation, and we provide a thorough examination of selection and confirmation method usage within the literature. We also discuss best practices for the multi-AGN literature, and we emphasize that a diverse, multiwavelength array of selection approaches is crucial for a complete understanding of multi-AGNs and - by extension - answering long-standing, open questions regarding the importance of AGNs and galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>A non-axisymmetric potential for the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a purely dynamical global map of the non-axisymmetric structure of the Milky Way disk. For this, we exploit the information contained within the in-plane motions of disk stars from Gaia DR3 to adjust a model of the Galactic potential, including a detailed parametric form for the bar and spiral arms. We explore the parameter space of the non-axisymmetric components with the backward integration method, first adjusting the bar model to selected peaks of the stellar velocity distribution in the Solar neighbourhood, and then adjusting the amplitude, phase, pitch angle and pattern speed of spiral arms to the median radial velocity as a function of position within the disk. We check a posteriori that our solution also qualitatively reproduces various other features of the global non-axisymmetric phase-space distribution, including most of the moving groups and phase-space ridges despite those not being primarily used in the adjustment. This fiducial model has a bar with pattern speed $37~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$ and two spiral modes that are two-armed and three-armed respectively. The two-armed spiral mode has a $\sim 25~\%$ local contrast surface density, a low pattern speed of $13.1~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$, and matches the location of the Crux-Scutum, Local and Outer arm segments. The three-armed spiral mode has a $\sim 9~\%$ local contrast density, a slightly higher pattern speed of $16.4~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$, and matches the location of the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus arm segments. The Galactic bar, with a higher pattern speed than both spiral modes, has recently disconnected from those two arms. The fiducial non-axisymmetric potential presented in this paper, reproducing most non-axisymmetric signatures detected in the stellar kinematics of the Milky Way disk, can henceforth be used to confidently integrate orbits within the Galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Mapping Galactic Dust Emission and Extinction with HI, HII, and H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) emission closely traces the dust column density at high Galactic latitudes and is thus a powerful tool for predicting dust extinction. However, the relation between HI column density $N_{\rm HI}$ and high-latitude dust emission observed by Planck has large-scale residuals at the level of $\lesssim 20\%$ on tens of degree scales. In this work, we improve HI-based dust templates in the North/South Galactic poles covering a sky fraction of $f_{\rm sky}=13.5\%/11.0\%$ (5,577/4,555 deg$^2$) by incorporating data from ionized (HII) and molecular (H$_2$) gas phases. We make further improvements by employing a clustering analysis on the HI spectral data to identify discrete clouds with distinct dust properties. However, only a modest reduction in fitting residuals is achieved. We quantify the contributions to these residuals from variations in the dust-to-gas ratio, dust temperature and opacity, and magnetic field orientation using ancillary datasets. Although residuals in a few particular regions can be attributed to these factors, no single explanation accounts for the majority. We derive an upper limit on the high-latitude dust temperature variation of $\sigma_T&lt;1.28$ K, lower than the temperature variation reported in previous studies. Joint analysis of multiple existing and upcoming datasets that trace Galactic gas and dust properties is needed to clarify the origins of the variation of gas and dust properties found here and to significantly improve gas-based extinction maps.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Supernova Remnants in a Cloudy Multiphase Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) in a two-phase cloudy medium by performing a series of high-resolution (up to $\Delta x\approx0.01\,\mathrm{pc}$), 3D hydrodynamical simulations including radiative cooling and thermal conduction. We aim to reach a resolution that directly captures the shock-cloud interactions for the majority of the clouds initialized by the saturation of thermal instability. In comparison to the SNR in a uniform medium with the volume filling warm medium, the SNR expands similarly (following $\propto t^{2/5}$) but sweeps up more mass as the cold clouds contribute before shocks in the warm medium become radiative. However, the SNR in a cloudy medium continuously loses energy after shocks toward the cold clouds cool, resulting in less hot gas mass, thermal energy, and terminal momentum. Thermal conduction has little effect on the dynamics of the SNR but smooths the morphology and modifies the internal structure by increasing the density of hot gas by a factor of $\sim 3-5$. The simulation results are not fully consistent with many previous 1D models describing the SNR in a cloudy medium including a mass loading term. By direct measurement in the simulations, we find that, apart from the mass source, the energy sink is also important with a spatially flat cooling rate $\dot{e}\propto t^{-11/5}$. As an illustration, we show an example 1D model including both mass source and energy sink terms (in addition to the radiative cooling in the volume filling component) that better describes the structure of the simulated SNR.</description>

      <title>Modelling carbon chain and complex organic molecules in the DR21(OH) clump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming regions host a large and evolving suite of molecular species. Molecular transition lines, particularly of complex molecules, can reveal the physical and dynamical environment of star formation. We aim to study the large-scale structure and environment of high-mass star formation through single-dish observations of CH$_3$CCH, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We have conducted a wide-band spectral survey with the IRAM 30-m telescope and the 100-m GBT towards the high-mass star-forming region DR21(OH)/N44. We use a multi-component local thermodynamic equilibrium model to determine the large-scale physical environment near DR21(OH) and the surrounding dense clumps. We follow up with a radiative transfer code for CH$_3$OH to look at non-LTE behaviour. We then use a gas-grain chemical model to understand the formation routes of these molecules in their observed environments. We disentangle multiple components of DR21(OH) in each of the three molecules. We find a warm and cold component each towards the dusty condensations MM1 and MM2, and a fifth broad, outflow component. We also reveal warm and cold components towards other dense clumps in our maps: N40, N36, N41, N38, and N48. We find thermal mechanisms are adequate to produce the observed abundances of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$CCH while non-thermal mechanisms are needed to produce CH$_3$OH. Through a combination of wide-band mapping observations, LTE and non-LTE model analysis, and chemical modelling, we disentangle the different velocity and temperature components within our clump-scale beam, a scale that links a star-forming core to its parent cloud. We find numerous warm, 20-80 K components corresponding to known cores and outflows in the region. We determine the production routes of these species to be dominated by grain chemistry.</description>

      <title>Understanding the UV/Optical Variability of AGNs through Quasi-Periodic Large-scale Magnetic Dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UV/optical light curves observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are well-characterized by damped random walk (DRW) process, with the damping time $\tau_d$ exhibiting correlations with both the black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and the photon wavelength ($\lambda$). However, the underlying physical origins for the DRW process and the scaling laws remain unclear. We aim to understand the AGN variability induced by a quasi-periodic large-scale dynamo in an accretion disk, and examine whether it reproduces the observed variability features in AGN UV/optical light curves. Using a one-dimensional, optically thick, geometrically thin disk model, we introduce variability into the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ by incorporating quasi-periodic large-scale magnetic fields. With reasonable dynamo parameters, our model successfully reproduces both the linear relation between the root-mean-square and the mean values of the radiation flux, and the log-normal distribution of the flux variability. The PSDs of accretion rates and radiation fluxes align well with DRW models, and yield consistent values of $\tau_d$ with AGN observations. Analytical arguments, supported by numerical evidence, suggest that the flattening of flux PSDs at low frequencies is governed by the timescale at the inner boundary of the emission region for a given wavelength. For $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, variations in the Eddington ratio flatten the $\tau_d$-$M_{BH}$ scaling, resulting in $\tau_d \propto M_{BH}^{0.5-1}$. For $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$, we find a steeper scaling, $\tau_d \propto M_{BH}$. Including further refinements, such as the dependence of dynamo properties on $M_{BH}$ and AGN luminosity, and accounting for X-ray reprocessing, would further enhance the accuracy of the model compared to observations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the dipole component of possible Galaxy-binary alignment in the mHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the usability of the gravitational wave detector LISA for studying the orientational distribution of compact white dwarf binaries in the Galactic bulge. We pay special attention to measuring the dipole pattern of the distribution around the Galactic rotation axis. Based on our new formulation, which leverages the parity properties of the involved systems, we found that the apparent thickness of the bulge in the sky becomes critical for the dipole measurement. We also discuss the extra-Galactic studies for black hole binaries and neutron star binaries with BBO/DECIGO.</description>

      <title>The temporal and spatial variations of lithium abundance in the Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the temporal and spatial variations in lithium abundance within the Milky Way using a sample of 22,034 main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars and subgiants, characterised by precise stellar ages, 3D NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) lithium abundances, and birth radii. Our results reveal a complex variation in lithium abundance with stellar age: a gradual increase from 14 Gyr to 6 Gyr, followed by a decline between 6 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr, and a rapid increase thereafter. We find that young Li-rich stars (ages $&lt;$ 4 Gyr, A(Li) $&gt;$ 2.7 dex) predominantly originate from the outer disc. By binning the sample according to guiding center radius and z$_{\rm max}$, we observe that these young Li-rich stars migrate radially to the local and inner discs. In addition, the stars originating from the inner disc experienced a rapid Li enrichment process between 8 Gyr and 6 Gyr. Our analysis suggests that the age range of Li-dip stars is 4-5 Gyr, encompassing evolution stages from MSTO stars to subgiants. The Galactic radial profile of A(Li) (with respect to birth radius), as a function of age, reveals three distinct periods: 14-6 Gyr ago, 6-4 Gyr ago, and 4-1 Gyr ago. Initially, the lithium abundance gradient is positive, indicating increasing Li abundance with birth radius. During the second period, it transitions to a negative and broken gradient, mainly affected by Li-dip stars. In the final period, the gradient reverts to a positive trend.</description>

      <title>Grain Size in the Class I Protostellar System TMC-1A Constrained with ALMA and VLA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disk mass and substructure in young stellar objects suggest that planet formation may start at the protostellar stage through the growth of dust grains. To accurately estimate the grain size at the protostellar stage, we have observed the Class I protostar TMC-1A using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at the Q (7 mm) and Ka (9 mm) bands at a resolution of ~0.2" and analyzed archival data of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) and 7 (0.9 mm) that cover the same spatial scale. The VLA images show a compact structure with a size of ~25 au and a spectral index of ~2.5. The ALMA images show compact and extended structures with a spectral index of ~2 at the central ~40 au region and another index of ~3.3 in the outer region. Our SED analysis using the observed fluxes at the four bands suggests one branch with a small grain size of ~0.12 mm and another with a grown grain size of ~4 mm. We also model polarized dust continuum emission adopting the two grain sizes and compare them with an observational result of TMC-1A, suggesting that the small grain size is preferable to the grown grain size. The small grain size implies gravitational instability in the TMC-1A disk, which is consistent with a spiral-like component recently identified.</description>

      <title>SDSS J102915.14+172927.9: Revisiting the chemical pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The small- to intermediate-mass ($M &lt;0.8 M_\odot$), most metal-poor stars that formed in the infancy of the Universe are still shining today in the sky. They are very rare, but their discovery and investigation brings new knowledge on the formation of the first stellar generations. Aims: SDSS J102915.14+172927.9 is one of the most metal-poor star known to date. Since no carbon can be detected in its spectrum, a careful upper limit is important, both to classify this star and to distinguish it from the carbon-enhanced stars that represent the majority at these metallicities. Methods: We undertook a new observational campaign to acquire high-resolution UVES spectra. The new spectra were combined with archival spectra in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. From the combined spectrum, we derived abundances for seven elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, and a tentative Li) and five significant upper limits (C, Na, Al, Sr, and Ba). Results: The star has a carbon abundance A(C) &lt;4.68 and therefore is not enhanced in carbon, at variance with the majority of the stars at this Fe regime, which typically show A(C)&gt; 6.0. A feature compatible with the Li doublet at 670.7 nm is tentatively detected. Conclusions: The upper limit on carbon implies $Z&lt;1.915 \times 10^{-6}$, more than 20 times lower than the most iron-poor star known. Therefore, the gas cloud out of which the star was formed did not cool via atomic lines but probably through dust. Fragmentation of the primordial cloud is another possibility for the formation of a star with a metallicity this low.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Galactic Substructures in 5D Space Using All-sky RR Lyrae Stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the vast gap between photometric and spectroscopic data volumes, there is great potential in using 5D kinematic information to identify and study substructures of the Milky Way. We identify substructures in the Galactic halo using 46,575 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) from Gaia DR3 with the photometric metallicities and distances newly estimated by Li et al. (2023). Assuming a Gaussian prior distribution of radial velocity, we calculate the orbital distribution characterized by the integrals of motion for each RRL based on its 3D positions, proper motions and corresponding errors, and then apply the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify groups moving along similar orbits. We have identified several known substructures, including Sagittarius (Sgr) Stream, Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC), Virgo Overdensity (VOD), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Orphan-Chenab stream, Cetus-Palca, Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Wukong and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) leading arm, along with 18 unknown groups. Our findings indicate that HAC and VOD have kinematic and chemical properties remarkably similar to GES, with most HAC and VOD members exhibiting eccentricity as high as GES, suggesting that they may share a common origin with GES. The ability to identify the low mass and spatially dispersed substructures further demonstrates the potential of our method, which breaks the limit of spectroscopic survey and is competent to probe the substructures in the whole Galaxy. Finally, we have also identified 18 unknown groups with good spatial clustering and proper motion consistency, suggesting more excavation of Milky Way substructures in the future with only 5D data.</description>

      <title>The Composite Spectral Energy Distribution of Quasars is Surprisingly Universal Since Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), we construct mean/median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for unique bright quasars in redshift bins of 0.2 and up to $z \simeq 3$, after taking the GALEX non-detection into account. Further correcting for the absorption of the intergalactic medium, these mean/median quasar SEDs constitute a surprisingly redshift-independent mean/median composite SED from the rest-frame optical down to $\simeq 500~{\rm \mathring A}$ for quasars with bolometric luminosity brighter than $10^{45.5}~{\rm erg s^{-1}}$. Moreover, the mean/median composite quasar SED is plausibly also independent of black hole mass and Eddington ratio, and suggests similar properties of dust and gas in the quasar host galaxies since cosmic noon. Both the mean and median composite SEDs are nicely consistent with previous mean composite quasar spectra at wavelengths beyond $\simeq 1000~{\rm \mathring A}$, but at shorter wavelengths, are redder, indicating, on average, less ionizing radiation than previously expected. Through comparing the model-predicted to the observed composite quasar SEDs, we favor a simply truncated disk model, rather than a standard thin disk model, for the quasar central engine, though we request more sophisticated disk models. Future deep ultraviolet facilities, such as the China Space Station Telescope and the Ultraviolet Explorer, would prompt revolutions in many aspects, including the quasar central engine, production of the broad emission lines in quasars, and cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Ageing and Quenching: Influence of Galaxy Environment and Nuclear Activity in Transition Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate whether the environment and the nuclear activity of a particular galaxy influence the ageing and quenching at the transition stage of the galaxy evolution using the volume-limited sample constructed from the twelve release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To this end, the galaxies were classified into isolated and non-isolated environments and then each subsample was further classified according to their nuclear activity using the WHAN diagnostic diagram, and ageing diagram to obtain ageing and quenching galaxies. The ageing and quenching galaxies at the transition stage were selected for the rest of the analysis. Using the star formation rate and the $u-r$ colour-stellar mass diagrams, the study revealed a significant change of $0.03$ dex in slope and $0.30$ dex in intercept for ageing galaxies and an insignificant change of $0.02$ dex in slope and $0.12$ dex in intercept of the star formation main sequence between isolated and non-isolated quenching galaxies. Further, a more significant change in the number of ageing galaxies above, within and below the main sequence and the green valley was observed. On the other hand, an insignificant change in the number of quenching galaxies above, within and below the main sequence and the green valley was observed. The study concludes that ageing depends on the environment and the dependence is influenced by the nuclear activity of a particular galaxy while quenching does not depend on the environment and this independence is not influenced by the nuclear activity.</description>

      <title>An iterative method to deblend AGN-Host contributions for Integral Field spectroscopic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new iterative deblending method to separate the host galaxy (HG) and their Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission with the use of Integral Field spectroscopic (IFS) data. The method decomposes the resolved HG emission from the unresolved AGN emission by modelling the two-dimensional surface brightness (SB) profile of the point-spread function (PSF) and the two-dimensional SB HG continuum simultaneously per each monochromatic slide. Our method does not require any prior information about the observed SB profile or a detailed fitting of the PSF, making it ideal for the automatic analysis of large galaxy samples. In this work, we test the quality of our method, its advantages, and its disadvantages. We test our method by using a set of IFS mock data cubes to quantify the reliability of our deblending process and further compare our method with the {\sc QDeblend3D} analysis tool. Furthermore, we applied our method to three data cubes selected from the MaNGA survey according to the dominance of either its HG or its AGN. We show that our deblending method is capable of disengaging the bright, nonresolved AGN emission from the HG continuum and its narrow emission lines. However, the decoupling depends on how well the IFS spatially resolves the PSF, and on the relative flux intensity of the HG-AGN. Therefore, the method is ideal for disentangling the bright-flux contribution from AGN-dominated spectra.</description>

      <title>TPCNet: Representation learning for HI mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TPCNet, a neural network predictor that combines Convolutional and Transformer architectures with Positional encodings, for neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) spectral analysis. Trained on synthetic datasets, our models predict cold neutral gas fraction ($f_\text{CNM}$) and HI opacity correction factor ($R_\text{HI}$) from emission spectra based on the learned relationships between the desired output parameters and observables (optically-thin column density and peak brightness). As a follow-up to Murray et al. (2020)'s shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we construct deep CNN models and compare them to TPCNet models. TPCNet outperforms deep CNNs, achieving a 10% average increase in testing accuracy, algorithmic (training) stability, and convergence speed. Our findings highlight the robustness of the proposed model with sinusoidal positional encoding applied directly to the spectral input, addressing perturbations in training dataset shuffling and convolutional network weight initializations. Higher spectral resolutions with increased spectral channels offer advantages, albeit with increased training time. Diverse synthetic datasets enhance model performance and generalization, as demonstrated by producing $f_\text{CNM}$ and $R_\text{HI}$ values consistent with evaluation ground truths. Applications of TPCNet to observed emission data reveal strong agreement between the predictions and Gaussian decomposition-based estimates (from emission and absorption surveys), emphasizing its potential in HI spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>BIG-SPARC: The new SPARC database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Surface Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database has provided the community with mass models for 175 nearby galaxies, allowing different research teams to test different dark matter models, galaxy evolution models, and modified gravity theories. Extensive tests, however, are hampered by the somewhat heterogeneous nature of the HI rotation curves and the limited sample size of SPARC. To overcome these limitations, we are working on BIG-SPARC, a new database that consists of about 4000 galaxies with HI datacubes from public telescope archives (APERTIF, ASKAP, ATCA, GMRT, MeerKAT, VLA, and WSRT) and near infrared photometry from WISE. For these galaxies, we will provide homogeneously derived HI rotation curves, surface brightness profiles, and mass models. BIG-SPARC is expected to increase the size of its predecessor by a factor of more than 20. This is a necessary step to prepare for the additional order of magnitude increase in sample size expected from ongoing and future HI surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinders</description>

      <title>The Impact of Galaxy-halo Size Relations on Galaxy Clustering Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies come in different sizes and morphologies, and these differences are thought to correlate with properties of their underlying dark matter halos. However, identifying the specific halo property that controls the galaxy size is a challenging task, especially because most halo properties are dependent on one another. In this work, we demonstrate this challenge by studying how the galaxy-halo size relations impact the galaxy clustering signals. We investigate the reason that a simple linear relation model, which prescribes that the galaxy size is linearly proportional to the dark matter halo's virial radius, can still produce clustering signals that match the observational data reasonably well. We find that this simple linear relation model for galaxy sizes, when combined with the subhalo abundance matching technique, introduces an implicit dependence on the halo formation history. As a result, the effect of halo assembly bias enters the resulting galaxy clustering, especially at lower stellar masses, producing a clustering signal that resembles the observed one. At higher stellar masses, the effect of halo assembly bias weakens and is partially canceled out by the effect of halo bias, and the clustering of large and small galaxies becomes more similar. Our study confirms that the information of halo formation history must play a role in determining galaxy sizes to match the observed clustering signals, but also highlights the challenge of identifying a particular halo property that controls galaxy sizes through constraints from galaxy clustering alone.</description>

      <title>FAST H I 21 cm study of blueberry galaxies</title>

Abstract: Green Peas (GPs) and blueberry galaxies (BBs) are thought to be local analogs ($z&lt;$0.1) of high redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters. H I study of these can help us understand the star formation in the primordial Universe. In this Letter, we present the results of H I 21 cm study of 28 high specific star formation rate (sSFR $\gtrsim$10$^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$) BBs at $z\lesssim$0.05 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We report significant H I detection towards two BBs namely J1026+0426 and J1132+0809, and discuss possible H I contribution from neighboring galaxies. The median 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $\sim$2.0$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ was obtained on H I mass for galaxies with nondetections. We find BBs tend to have lower H I-to-stellar mass ratio or gas fraction ($f_{\rm HI}$) than expected from $f_{\rm HI}$-sSFR and $f_{\rm HI}$-$M_{\ast}$ relations for main-sequence galaxies. The BBs also have a median 3$\sigma$ upper limit on H I gas depletion time scale ($\tau_{\rm HI}$) $\sim$0.5 Gyr, about 1 order of magnitude lower than $\tau_{\rm HI}$ for local main-sequence galaxies. We find a significantly low H I detection rate of 2/28 (7.1$^{+9.4}_{-4.6}$ \%) towards these galaxies, which is similar to previous H I studies of low redshift GPs of high ionization parameter indicator, O32 $\equiv$O[{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007/O[{\sc ii}]$\lambda$3727 ratios $\gtrsim$10.</description>

      <title>A Survey of H I and O VI Absorption Lines in the Outskirts of $z\lesssim0.3$ Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) in the far outskirts (r $&gt;$ 2-3 R$_{200}$) of galaxy clusters interfaces with the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is theorized to comprise diffuse, multiphase gas. This medium may hold vital clues to clusters' thermodynamic evolution and far-reaching impacts on infalling, future cluster galaxies. The diffuse outskirts of clusters are well-suited for quasar absorption line observations, capable of detecting gas to extremely low column densities. We analyze 18 QSO spectra observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope whose lines of sight trace the gaseous environments of 26 galaxy clusters from within R$_{200}$ to 6 R$_{200}$ in projection. We measure the dN/dz and covering fraction of H I and O VI associated with the foreground clusters as a function of normalized impact parameter. We find the dN/dz for H I is consistent with the IGM field value for all impact parameter bins, with an intriguing slight elevation between 2 and 3 R$_{200}$. The dN/dz for O VI is also consistent with the field value (within 3$\sigma$) for all impact parameter bins, with potential elevations in dN/dz both within 1-2 R$_{200}$ and beyond 4 R$_{200}$ at $&gt;2\sigma$. We propose physical scenarios that may give rise to these tentative excesses, such as a buildup of neutral gas at the outer accretion shock front and a signature of the warm-hot IGM. We do not find a systematic excess of potentially associated galaxies near the sightlines where O VI is detected; thus, the detected O VI does not have a clear circumgalactic origin.</description>

      <title>Cocoon shock, X-ray cavities and extended Inverse Compton emission in Hercules A: clues from Chandra observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of jet activity in the radio galaxy 3C348 at the center of the galaxy cluster Hercules A. We use archival Chandra data to investigate the jet-driven shock front, the radio-faint X-ray cavities, the eastern jet, and the presence of extended Inverse Compton (IC) X-ray emission from the radio lobes. We detect two pairs of shocks: one in the north-south direction at 150 kpc from the center, and another in the east-west direction at 280 kpc. These shocks have Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M} = 1.65\pm0.05$ and $\mathcal{M} = 1.9\pm0.3$, respectively. Together, they form a complete cocoon around the large radio lobes. Based on the distance of the shocks from the center, we estimate that the corresponding jet outburst is 90-150 Myr old. We confirm the presence of two radio-faint cavities within the cocoon, misaligned from the lobes, each $\sim$100 kpc wide and 40-60 Myr old. A backflow from the radio lobes might explain why the cavities are dynamically younger than the cocoon shock front. We also detect non-thermal X-ray emission from the eastern jet and from the large radio lobes. The X-ray emission from the jet is visible at 80 kpc from the AGN and can be accounted for by an IC model with a mild Doppler boosting ($\delta\sim2.7$). A synchrotron model could explain the radio-to-X-ray spectrum only for very high Lorentz factors $\gamma\geq10^{8}$ of the electrons in the jet. For the large radio lobes, we argue that the X-ray emission has an IC origin, with a 1 keV flux density of $21.7\pm1.4\text{(statistical)}\pm1.3\text{(systematic)}$ nJy. A thermal model is unlikely, as it would require unrealistically high gas temperature, density, and pressure, along with a strong depolarization of the radio lobes, which are instead highly polarized. The IC detection, combined with the synchrotron flux density, suggests a magnetic field of $12\pm3\mu$G in the lobes.</description>

      <title>Bringing together African &amp; European research communities with an inclusive astronomy conference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together the African and European academic astronomy communities. This conference aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international networking events (i.e., the typical experience of those affiliated with Western institutions), with those who have been historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge problems in the research field, but with a large focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diverse representation of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may have never attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Throughout this process maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment. We summarise some of the successes, challenges, and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants, which demonstrates an overall achievement of our objectives. This is all combined to provide some key recommendations for any groups, from any research field, who wishes to lead similar initiatives.</description>

      <title>How do supernova remnants cool? II. Machine learning analysis of supernova remnant simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About 15%-60% of all supernova remnants are estimated to interact with dense molecular clouds. In these high density environments, radiative losses are significant. The cooling radiation can be observed in forbidden lines at optical wavelengths. We aim to determine whether supernovae at different positions within a molecular cloud can be distinguished based on their optical emission, using machine learning. We have conducted a statistical analysis of the optical line emission of simulated supernovae interacting with molecular clouds that formed from the multi-phase interstellar medium modelled in the SILCC-Zoom simulations with and without magnetic fields. This work is based on the post-processing of 3-D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations. Our data set consists of 22 simulations. The supernovae are placed at a distance of either 25 pc or 50 pc from the molecular cloud centre of mass. First, we calculate optical synthetic emission maps (taking into account dust attenuation within the simulation sub-cube). Second, we analyse the data set of synthetic observations using principle component analysis to identify clusters with the k-means algorithm. We find that the presence or absence of magnetic fields has no statistically significant effect on the optical line emission. However, the ambient density distribution at the site of the supernova changes the entire evolution and morphology of the supernova remnant. Due to the different ambient densities in the 25 pc and 50 pc simulations, we are able to distinguish them in a statistically significant manner. Although, optical line attenuation within the supernova remnant can mimic this result depending on the attenuation model that is used. That is why, multi-dimensional analysis of optical emission line ratios in this work does not give extra information about the environmental conditions (ambient density and ambient magnetic field) of the SNR.</description>

      <title>Empirical color correction to MIST and PARSEC isochrones on Gaia BR-RP and G-RP with benchmark open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent literature reports a color deviation between observed Gaia color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and theoretical model isochrone predictions, particularly in the very low-mass regime. To assess its impact on cluster age determination via isochrone fitting, we quantified the color deviations for three benchmark clusters, Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe, both for the Gaia color (BP-RP) and (G-RP). In general, the (G-RP) color deviations are smaller than the (BP-RP) ones. Empirical color correction functions based on these benchmarks are derived for the currently available MIST and PARSEC 1.2S isochrone models. Applying the correction functions to 31 additional open clusters and 3 moving groups results in a significantly improved alignment between the isochrones and observed CMDs. With our empirical corrections, isochrones provide age estimates consistent with literature values obtained through the spectral Lithium Depletion Boundary method, validating the effectiveness of our approach. The corresponding metallicities with PARSEC 1.2S also show a good agreement with the spectroscopic results. The empirical color correction function we present in this work offers a tool for a consistent age determination within the full mass range of stellar clusters using the isochrone fitting method.</description>

      <title>HiFAST: An HI Data Calibration and Imaging Pipeline for FAST III. Standing Wave Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standing waves existed in radio telescope data are primarily due to reflections among the instruments, which significantly impact the spectrum quality of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Eliminating these standing waves for FAST is challenging given the constant changes in their phases and amplitudes. Over a ten-second period, the phases shift by 18$^{\circ}$ while the amplitudes fluctuate by 6 mK. Thus, we developed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) filter method to eliminate these standing waves for every individual spectrum. The FFT filter can decrease the root mean square (RMS) from 3.2 to 1.15 times the theoretical estimate. Compared to other methods such as sine fitting and running median, the FFT filter achieves a median RMS of approximately 1.2 times the theoretical expectation and the smallest scatter at 12%. Additionally, the FFT filter method avoids the flux loss issue encountered with some other methods. The FFT is also efficient in detecting harmonic radio frequency interference (RFI). In the FAST data, we identified three distinct types of harmonic RFI, each with amplitudes exceeding 100 mK and intrinsic frequency periods of 8.1, 0.5, and 0.37 MHz, respectively. The FFT filter, proven as the most effective method, is integrated into the HI data calibration and imaging pipeline for FAST (HiFAST, https://hifast.readthedocs.io).</description>

      <title>EWOCS-III: JWST observations of the supermassive star cluster Westerlund 1</title>

Abstract: The typically large distances, extinction, and crowding of Galactic supermassive star clusters have so far hampered the identification of their very low mass members, required to extend our understanding of star and planet formation, and early stellar evolution, to starburst. This situation has now evolved thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and its unmatched resolution and sensitivity in the infrared. In this paper, the third of the series of the Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey (EWOCS), we present JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI observations of the supermassive star cluster Westerlund 1. These observations are specifically designed to unveil the cluster members down to the BD mass regime, and to allow us to select and study the protoplanetary disks and to study the mutual feedback between the cluster members and the surrounding environment. Westerlund 1 was observed as part of JWST GO-1905 for 23.6 hours. The data have been reduced using the JWST calibration pipeline, together with specific tools necessary to remove artifacts. Source identification and photometry were performed with DOLPHOT. The MIRI images show a plethora of different features. Diffuse nebular emission is observed around the cluster, which is typically composed of myriads of droplet-like features pointing toward the cluster center or the group of massive stars surrounding the WR star W72/A. A long pillar is also observed in the NW. The MIRI images also show resolved shells and outflows surrounding the M-type RSG W20, W26, W75, and W237, the sgB[e] star W9 and the YHG W4. The color-magnitude diagrams built using the NIRCam photometry show a clear cluster sequence, which is marked in its upper part by the 1828 NIRCam stars with X-ray counterparts. NIRCam observations using the F115W filter have reached the 23.8 mag limit with 50\% completeness (roughly corresponding to a 0.06 Msol brown dwarf).</description>

      <title>Measurement of interstellar extinction for classical T Tauri stars using far-UV H2 line fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interstellar and potentially circumstellar extinction in the sight lines of classical T Tauri stars is an important ingredient for constructing reliable spectral energy distributions, which catalyze protoplanetary disk chemistry, for example. Therefore, some attempts of measuring $A_{V}$ toward individual stars have been made using partly different wavelength regimes and different underlying assumptions. We used strong lines of Ly{\alpha} fluorescent H2 and derived the extinction based on the assumption of optically thin transitions. We investigated a sample of 72 classical T Tauri stars observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in the framework of the ULLYSES program. We computed $A_{V}$ and $R_{V}$ values for the 34 objects with sufficient data quality and an additionally $A_{V}$ value for the canonical $R_{V}$ = 3.1 value. Our results agree largely with values obtained from optical data. Moreover, we confirm the degeneracy between $A_{V}$ and $R_{V}$ and present possibilities to break this. Finally, we discuss whether the assumption of optical thin lines is valid.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to estimate mid-infrared fluxes from WISE data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While WISE is the largest, best quality infrared all-sky survey to date, a smaller coverage mission, Spitzer, was designed to have better sensitivity and spatial resolution at similar wavelengths. Confusion and contamination in WISE data result in discrepancies between them. We present a novel approach to work with WISE measurements with the goal of maintaining both its high coverage and vast amount of data while taking full advantage of the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of Spitzer. We have applied machine learning (ML) techniques to a complete WISE data sample of open cluster members, using a training set of paired data from high-quality Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), MIPS and IRAC, and allWISE catalogs, W1 (3.4 {\mu}m) to W4 (22 {\mu}m) bands. We have tested several ML regression models with the aim of predicting mid-infrared fluxes at MIPS1 (24 {\mu}m) and IRAC4 (8 {\mu}m) bands from WISE fluxes and quality flags. In addition, to improve the prediction quality, we have implemented feature selection techniques to remove irrelevant WISE variables. We have notably enhanced WISE detection capabilities, mostly at lowest magnitudes, which previously showed the largest discrepancies with Spitzer. In our particular case, extremely randomized trees was found to be the best algorithm to predict mid-infrared fluxes from WISE variables. We have tested our results in the SED of members of IC 348. We show discrepancies in the measurements of Spitzer and WISE and demonstrate the good concordance of our predicted fluxes with the real ones. ML is a fast and powerful tool that can be used to find hidden relationships between datasets, as the ones that exist between WISE and Spitzer fluxes. We believe this approach could be employed for other samples from the allWISE catalog with SEIP positional counterparts, and in other astrophysical studies with analogous discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Eppur si muove: Evidence of disc precession or a sub-milliparsec SMBH binary in the QPE-emitting galaxy GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense soft X-ray bursts from the nuclei of nearby low-mass galaxies typically lasting about one hour and repeating every few. Their physical origin remains debated, although so-called impacts models in which a secondary orbiting body pierces through the accretion disc around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system are considered promising. In this work, we study the QPE timing properties of GSN 069, the first galactic nucleus in which QPEs were identified, primarily focusing on Observed minus Calculated (O-C) diagrams. The O-C data in GSN 069 are consistent with a super-orbital modulation on tens of days whose properties do not comply with the impacts model. We suggest that rigid precession of a misaligned accretion disc or, alternatively, the presence of a second SMBH forming a sub-milliparsec binary with the inner EMRI is needed to reconcile the model with the data. In both cases, the quiescent accretion disc emission should also be modulated on similar timescales. Current X-ray monitoring indicates that this might be the case, although a longer baseline of higher-cadence observations is needed to confirm the tentative X-ray flux periodicity on firm statistical grounds. Future dedicated monitoring campaigns will be crucial to test the overall impacts plus modulation model in GSN 069, and to distinguish between the two proposed modulating scenarios. If our interpretation is correct, QPEs in GSN 069 represent the first electromagnetic detection of a short-period EMRI system in an external galaxy, opening the way to future multi-messenger astronomical observations.

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Harmonic Analysis of the Pulsar Angular Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array observations have found evidence for an isotropic gravitational wave background with the Hellings-Downs angular correlations, expected from general relativity. This interpretation hinges on the measured shape of the angular correlations, which is predominately quadrupolar under general relativity. Here we explore a more flexible parameterization: we expand the angular correlations into a sum of Legendre polynomials and use a Bayesian analysis to constrain their coefficients with the 15-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). When including Legendre polynomials with multipoles $\ell \geq 2$, we only find a significant signal in the quadrupole with an amplitude consistent with general relativity and non-zero at the $\sim 95\%$ confidence level and a Bayes factor of 200. When we include multipoles $\ell \leq 1$, the Bayes factor evidence for quadrupole correlations decreases by more than an order of magnitude due to evidence for a monopolar signal at approximately 4 nHz which has also been noted in previous analyses of the NANOGrav 15-year data. Further work needs to be done in order to better characterize the properties of this monopolar signal and its effect on the evidence for quadrupolar angular correlations.</description>

      <title>Accreting Binary Eccentricities follow Predicted Equilibrium Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate observations of circumbinary disks (CBD), to find evidence for an equilibrium eccentricity predicted by current binary accretion theory. Although stellar binary demographics in the Milky Way show no evidence for a preferred eccentricity for binary systems, we show that actively accreting systems lie on a predicted equilibrium eccentricity curve. We constrain our sample to only systems that have well defined orbital parameters (e.g,. eccentricity, mass-ratio, inclination angle). We find observations are consistent with theory for stellar binaries that are aligned with the disk and that are separated enough that tidal circularization is negligible. This suggests that eccentricity in these systems evolves after the dissipation of the CBD, given the flat eccentricity distribution of binary systems in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>On the nature of LOFAR RMs and new constraints on magnetic fields in cosmic filaments and on magnetogenesis scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of magnetic fields in cosmic web filaments can be used to reveal the magnetogenesis of the Universe. In previous work, we produced first estimates of the field strength and its redshift evolution using the Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) catalogue of extragalactic background sources at low frequency obtained with LOFAR observations. Here we refine our analysis by selecting sources with low Galactic RM, which reduces its residual contamination. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the different contributions to the extragalactic RMs along the line of sight, and confirm that they are dominated by the cosmic filaments component, with only 21 percent originating in galaxy clusters and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. We find a possible hint of a shock at the virial radius of massive galaxies. We also find that the fractional polarization of background sources might be a valuable CGM tracer. The newly selected RMs have a steeper evolution with redshift than previously found. The field strength in filaments ($B_f$) and its evolution are estimated assuming $B_f$ evolves as a power-law $B_f=B_{f,0}\,(1+z)^\alpha$. Our analysis finds an average strength at $z=0$ of $B_{f,0} =11$--15~nG, with an error of 4 nG, and a slope $\alpha=2.3$--$2.6 \pm 0.5$, which is steeper than what we previously found. The comoving field has a slope of $\beta=$ [0.3, 0.6$]\pm 0.5$ that is consistent with being invariant with redshift. Primordial magnetogenesis scenarios are favoured by our data, together with a sub-dominant astrophysical-origin RM component increasing with redshift.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Mechanisms Behind the Distribution of Galactic Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution and distribution of metals within galaxies are critical for understanding galactic evolution and star formation processes, but the mechanisms responsible for shaping this distribution remain uncertain. In this study we carry out high-resolution simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, including a star-by-star treatment of both feedback and element injection. We include seven key isotopes of observational and physical interest, and which are distributed across different nucleosynthetic channels. After running the simulations to statistical steady state, we examine the spatial and temporal statistics of the metal distributions and their fluctuations. We show that these statistics reflect a mixture properties dependent on the large-scale structure of the galaxy and those that vary depending on the particular nucleosynthetic channel that dominates production of a particular isotope. The former ensure that different elements are highly-correlated with one another even if they have different nucleosynthetic origins, and their spatial correlations vary together in time. The latter means that the small variations between elements that are present naturally break them into nucleosynthetic familiars, with elements that originate from different channels correlating better with each other than with elements with different origins. Our findings suggest both challenges and opportunities for ongoing efforts to use chemical measurements of gas and stars to unravel the history and physics of galaxy assembly.</description>

      <title>Searching for HI around MHONGOOSE Galaxies via Spectral Stacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed star formation rates of galaxies in the Local Universe suggests that they are replenishing their gas reservoir across cosmic time. Cosmological simulations predict that this accretion of fresh gas can occur in a hot or a cold mode, yet the existence of low column density ($\sim10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) tracing the cold mode has not been unambiguously confirmed by observations. We present the application of unconstrained spectral stacking to attempt to detect the emission from this HI in the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) and Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM) of 6 nearby star forming galaxies from the MHONGOOSE sample for which full-depth observations are available. Our stacking procedure consists of a standard spectral stacking algorithm coupled with a one-dimensional spectral line finder designed to extract reliable signal close to the noise level. In agreement with previous studies, we found that the amount of signal detected outside the HI disk is much smaller than implied by simulations. Furthermore, the column density limit that we achieve via stacking ($\sim10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) suggests that direct detection of the neutral CGM/IGM component might be challenging in the future, even with the next generation of radio telescopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral classification is the division of stars into classes based on their spectral characteristics. Different classification systems have existed since the 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been developed since then. The MK classification has three components: a spectral type, a luminosity class, and (possibly) suffixes or qualifiers. The first two components represent temperature and luminosity sequences (a 2-D grid), respectively, and the third one includes additional information. The MK system is an Aristotelian morphological classification system that uses the MK process, an inductive approach based on specimens (standard stars) that define the system. In that respect, it is different from and a required preliminary step for quantitative spectroscopy, whose goal is to extract the physical properties and chemical composition of the stars. In this entry we provide a brief history of spectral classification, describe the general properties of the classification criteria of the MK system, analyze the specific spectral type and luminosity class criteria used for each spectral class, and introduce the different peculiar types that can be found within the 2-D classification grid and at its edges.</description>

      <title>Blue straggler stars</title>

Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

Abstract: Massive main-sequence stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes, but also sub-surface convection zones caused by partial ionisation. However, the convective properties depend on opacity and a star's metallicity. Non-rotating 1D evolution models of main-sequence stars with the metallicity of the SMC suggest tenuous sub-surface convection zones using the Rayleigh number as a criterion for convection owing to their lower metallicity. We test whether massive stars of different metallicities both inside and outside of asteroseismically calibrated stability windows for sub-surface convection exhibit different properties in stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability. We extracted customised light curves from the TESS mission for a sample of massive stars using an effective point spread function (ePSF) method, and compared their morphologies in terms of characteristic frequency and amplitude using a Gaussian process (GP) regression methodology. We demonstrate that the properties of SLF variability are generally consistent across the metallicity range from the Milky Way down to the SMC, for stars both inside and outside of the sub-surface stability windows. We conclude that non-rotating 1D stellar structure models cannot alone be used to explain SLF variability in light curves of massive stars. The similar properties of SLF variability across a range of metallicity values, which follow the same trends in mass and age in the HR diagram at both high and low metallicity, support a transition in the dominant mechanism causing SLF variability from younger to more evolved stars. Specifically, core-excited internal gravity waves (IGWs) are favoured for younger stars lacking sub-surface convection zones, especially at low metallicity, and sub-surface convection zones are favoured for more evolved massive stars.

      <title>Detection of the lowest mass ratio contact binary in the universe: TYC 3801-1529-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first analysis of the contact binary TYC 3801-1529-1. We observed four sets of multiple bands complete light curves and one set of radial velocity curve of the primary component. Based on a simultaneous investigation of our observed and TESS light curves and the radial velocity curve, we found that TYC 3801-1529-1 is an extremely low-mass-ratio, medium contact binary with $q=0.0356$, with the contribution of the third light at a level of about 10\%. Its mass ratio is lower than V1187 Her, making TYC 3801-1529-1 the lowest mass-ratio contact binary ever found in the universe. The light curves observed in 2022 are asymmetric, which is aptly explained by a hot spot on the primary component. A 16-year eclipse timings analysis indicates a secular increase orbital period with a rate of dp/dt$=7.96(\pm0.35)\times10^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$. We studied the stability of this target and identified that not only the value of $J_{spin}/J_{orb}$, but also the mass ratio surpass the unstable boundary. Hence, TYC 3801-1529-1 presents a challenge to theoretical research and ought to be considered a progenitor of a contact binary merger.</description>
