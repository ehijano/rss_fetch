      <title>A Deadline-Aware Scheduler for Smart Factory using WiFi 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key strategy for making production in factories more efficient is to collect data about the functioning of machines, and dynamically adapt their working. Such smart factories have data packets with a mix of stringent and non-stringent deadlines with varying levels of importance that need to be delivered via a wireless network. However, the scheduling of packets in the wireless network is crucial to satisfy the deadlines. In this work, we propose a technique of utilizing IEEE 802.11ax, popularly known as WiFi 6, for such applications. IEEE 802.11ax has a few unique characteristics, such as specific configurations of dividing the channels into resource units (RU) for packet transmission and synchronized parallel transmissions. We model the problem of scheduling packets by assigning profit to each packet and then maximizing the sum of profits. We first show that this problem is strongly NP-Hard, and then propose an approximation algorithm with a 12-approximate algorithm. Our approximation algorithm uses a variant of local search to associate the right RU configuration to each packet and identify the duration of each parallel transmission. Finally, we extensively simulate different scenarios to show that our algorithm works better than other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Looking AT the Blue Skies of Bluesky</title>

Abstract: The pitfalls of centralized social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter/X, have led to concerns about control, transparency, and accountability. Decentralized social networks have emerged as a result with the goal of empowering users. These decentralized approaches come with their own tradeoffs, and therefore multiple architectures exist. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale analysis of Bluesky, a prominent decentralized microblogging platform. In contrast to alternative approaches (e.g. Mastodon), Bluesky decomposes and opens the key functions of the platform into subcomponents that can be provided by third party stakeholders. We collect a comprehensive dataset covering all the key elements of Bluesky, study user activity and assess the diversity of providers for each sub-components.</description>

      <title>Simulators for Quantum Network Modelling: A Comprehensive Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum network research, is exploring new networking protocols, physics-based hardware and novel experiments to demonstrate how quantum distribution will work over large distances. Current work explores much of these concepts in simulations, that are developed to understand how quantum networking will be set up and researchers can experiment virtually. Exposing flaws in network designs, like unsustainable topologies, or develop protocols that efficiently utilize network resources, simulators can also help assess whether workloads are balanced across virtual machines in the network. However, much of these simulation models come without reliable verification methods, for testing performance in real deployments.
  In this paper, we present a review of, to the best of our knowledge, currently used toolkits for modeling quantum networks. With these toolkits and standardized validation techniques, we can lay down the foundations for more accurate and reliable quantum network simulators.</description>

      <title>MAC protocol classification in the ISM band using machine learning methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of new technologies and a growing number of wireless networks, we face the problem of radio spectrum shortages. As a result, identifying the wireless channel spectrum to exploit the channel's idle state while also boosting network security is a pivotal issue. Detecting and classifying protocols in the MAC sublayer enables Cognitive Radio users to improve spectrum utilization and minimize potential interference. In this paper, we classify the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocols, which are the most widely used MAC sublayer protocols in the ISM radio band. With the advent of various wireless technologies, especially in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, the ISM frequency spectrum has become crowded and high-traffic, which faces a lack of spectrum resources and user interference. Therefore, identifying and classifying protocols is an effective and useful method. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, known for their advanced classification capabilities, we apply Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, which are machine learning algorithms, to classify protocols into three classes: Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Beacon, and Bluetooth. To capture the signals, we use the USRP N210 Software Defined Radio device and sample the real data in the indoor environment in different conditions of the presence and absence of transmitters and receivers for these two protocols. By assembling this dataset and studying the time and frequency features of the protocols, we extract the frame width and the silence gap between the two frames as time features and the PAPR of each frame as a power feature. By comparing the output of the protocols classification in different conditions and also adding Gaussian noise, it was found that the samples in the nonlinear SVM method with RBF and KNN functions have the best performance, with 97.83% and 98.12% classification accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distributed Noncoherent Joint Transmission Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dense Small Cell MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dense small cell (DSC) network where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) transmit data to single-antenna users over a shared frequency band. To enhance capacity, a state-of-the-art technique known as noncoherent joint transmission (JT) is applied, enabling users to receive data from multiple coordinated SBSs. However, the sum rate maximization problem with noncoherent JT is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard. While existing optimization-based noncoherent JT algorithms can provide near-optimal performance, they require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, which makes them difficult to be implemeted in DSC networks.To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem.The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions.By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate.In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Feasibility of Automated Data Standardization using Large Language Models for Seamless Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a feasibility study for real-time automated data standardization leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance seamless positioning systems in IoT environments. By integrating and standardizing heterogeneous sensor data from smartphones, IoT devices, and dedicated systems such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB), our study ensures data compatibility and improves positioning accuracy using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The core components include the Intelligent Data Standardization Module (IDSM), which employs a fine-tuned LLM to convert varied sensor data into a standardized format, and the Transformation Rule Generation Module (TRGM), which automates the creation of transformation rules and scripts for ongoing data standardization. Evaluated in real-time environments, our study demonstrates adaptability and scalability, enhancing operational efficiency and accuracy in seamless navigation. This study underscores the potential of advanced LLMs in overcoming sensor data integration complexities, paving the way for more scalable and precise IoT navigation solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient deployment and operation of any wireless communication ecosystem rely on knowledge of the received signal quality over the target coverage area. This knowledge is typically acquired through radio propagation solvers, which however suffer from intrinsic and well-known performance limitations. This article provides a primer on how integrating deep learning and conventional propagation modeling techniques can enhance multiple vital facets of wireless network operation, and yield benefits in terms of efficiency and reliability. By highlighting the pivotal role that the deep learning-based radio propagation models will assume in next-generation wireless networks, we aspire to propel further research in this direction and foster their adoption in additional applications.</description>

      <title>Age and Value of Information Optimization for Systems with Multi-Class Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Received samples of a stochastic process are processed by a server for delivery as updates to a monitor. Each sample belongs to a class that specifies a distribution for its processing time and a function that describes how the value of the processed update decays with age at the monitor. The class of a sample is identified when the processed update is delivered. The server implements a form of M/G/1/1 blocking queue; samples arriving at a busy server are discarded and samples arriving at an idle server are subject to an admission policy that depends on the age and class of the prior delivered update. For the delivered updates, we characterize the average age of information (AoI) and average value of information (VoI). We derive the optimal stationary policy that minimizes the convex combination of the AoI and (negative) VoI. It is shown that the policy has a threshold structure, in which a new sample is allowed to arrive to the server only if the previous update's age and value difference surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the specifics of the value function and system statistics.</description>

      <title>2FA Sketch: Two-Factor Armor Sketch for Accurate and Efficient Heavy Hitter Detection in Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.02203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting heavy hitters, which are flows exceeding a specified threshold, is crucial for network measurement, but it faces challenges due to increasing throughput and memory constraints. Existing sketch-based solutions, particularly those using Comparative Counter Voting, have limitations in efficiently identifying heavy hitters. This paper introduces the Two-Factor Armor (2FA) Sketch, a novel data structure designed to enhance heavy hitter detection in data streams. 2FA Sketch implements dual-layer protection through an improved $\mathtt{Arbitration}$ strategy for in-bucket competition and a cross-bucket conflict $\mathtt{Avoidance}$ hashing scheme. By theoretically deriving an optimal $\lambda$ parameter and redesigning $vote^+_{new}$ as a conflict indicator, it optimizes the Comparative Counter Voting strategy. Experimental results show that 2FA Sketch outperforms the standard Elastic Sketch, reducing error rates by 2.5 to 19.7 times and increasing processing speed by 1.03 times.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Learning for Clustering of Wireless Spectrum Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, much work has been done on processing of wireless spectrum data involving machine learning techniques in domain-related problems for cognitive radio networks, such as anomaly detection, modulation classification, technology classification and device fingerprinting. Most of the solutions are based on labeled data, created in a controlled manner and processed with supervised learning approaches. However, spectrum data measured in real-world environment is highly nondeterministic, making its labeling a laborious and expensive process, requiring domain expertise, thus being one of the main drawbacks of using supervised learning approaches in this domain. In this paper, we investigate the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for exploring spectrum activities in a real-world unlabeled data. In particular, we compare the performance of two SSL models, one based on a reference DeepCluster architecture and one adapted for spectrum activity identification and clustering, and a baseline model based on K-means clustering algorithm. We show that SSL models achieve superior performance regarding the quality of extracted features and clustering performance. With SSL models we achieve reduction of the feature vectors size by two orders of magnitude, while improving the performance by a factor of 2 to 2.5 across the evaluation metrics, supported by visual assessment. Additionally we show that adaptation of the reference SSL architecture to the domain data provides reduction of model complexity by one order of magnitude, while preserving or even improving the clustering performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) systems are virtual representations of physical assets allowing organizations to gain insights and improve existing processes. In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.</description>

      <title>Power-Domain Interference Graph Estimation for Multi-hop BLE Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional wisdom for network management allocates network resources separately for the measurement and communication tasks. Heavy measurement tasks may compete limited resources with communication tasks and significantly degrade overall network performance. It is therefore challenging for the interference graph, deemed as incurring heavy measurement overhead, to be used in practice in wireless networks. To address this challenge in wireless sensor networks, our core insight is to use power as a new dimension for interference graph estimation (IGE) such that IGE can be done simultaneously with the communication tasks using the same frequency-time resources. We propose to marry power-domain IGE with concurrent flooding to achieve simultaneous measurement and communication in BLE networks, where the power linearity prerequisite for power-domain IGE holds naturally true in concurrent flooding. With extensive experiments, we conclude the necessary conditions for the power linearity to hold and analyze several nonlinearity issues of power related to hardware imperfections. We design and implement network protocols and power control algorithms for IGE in multi-hop BLE networks and conduct experiments to show that the marriage is mutually beneficial for both IGE and concurrent flooding. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of IGE in improving channel map convergence and convergecast in BLE networks.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement Purification Scheduling to Fidelity-constrained Multi-Flow Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently emerged as a disruptive networking paradigm, quantum networks rely on the mysterious quantum entanglement to teleport qubits without physically transferring quantum particles. However, the state of quantum systems is extremely fragile due to environment noise. A promising technique to combat against quantum decoherence is entanglement purification. To fully exploit its benefit, two fundamental research questions need to be answered: (1) given an entanglement path, what is the optimal entanglement purification schedule? (2) how to compute min-cost end-to-end entanglement paths subject to fidelity constraint? In this paper, we give algorithmic solutions to both questions. For the first question, we develop an optimal entanglement purification scheduling algorithm for the single-hop case and analyze the \textsc{purify-and-swap} strategy in the multi-hop case by establishing the closed-form condition for its optimality. For the second question, we design a polynomial-time algorithm constructing an $\epsilon$-optimal fidelity-constrained path. The effectiveness of our algorithms are also numerically demonstrated by extensive simulations.</description>
