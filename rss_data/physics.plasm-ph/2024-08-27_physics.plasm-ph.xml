      <title>Drift instabilities driven by slab ion temperature gradient in suprathermal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drift instabilities driven by the slab ion temperature gradient (ITG) in Kappa-distributed plasmas are investigated by the kinetic method. The linear dispersion relation is given in an integral representation involving only the standard plasma dispersion function. The wave frequency and growth rate are derived without the density inhomogeneity. Numerical solutions of the dispersion equation are conducted to show the different effects of the suprathermal ions and electrons. We find that the suprathermal ions can enhance the instability in large wavenumbers but suppress it in small wavenumbers. Thus, the suprathermalization of ions could be one of the factors leading to a lower limit of wavenumbers for the ITG instabilities. Besides, the numerical calculations also imply that the thermal speed ratio affects the intensities of the suprathermal effects. Finally, in the presence of density inhomogeneity, the ITG instability boundary is numerically analyzed.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Study of a Collective Thomson Scattering Diagnostic for SPARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SPARC tokamak is a compact high-field device that will operate at high plasma density with the aim to demonstrate net fusion energy. The experimentally unexplored plasma conditions in SPARC will require a carefully selected set of diagnostics for plasma monitoring and control. Here we explore conceptual design options and potential measurement capabilities of a collective Thomson scattering diagnostic at SPARC. We show that a 140 GHz X-mode CTS system is the most attractive option in terms of optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio and limiting sensitivity to refraction, as well as from a technological readiness perspective. Such a setup can provide core-localized measurements of the fusion -born alpha distribution function, main-ion temperature and toroidal rotation, fuel-ion ratio, and 3He content with relevant spatio-temporal resolution. Our proposed diagnostic layout can in principle be integrated into SPARC and could provide a valuable addition to its diagnostic suite at limited development costs and time.</description>

      <title>Verification of Fast Ion Effects on Turbulence through Comparison of GENE and CGYRO with L-mode Plasmas in KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a cross-verification of fast ion effects on turbulence through a systematic comparison of two leading gyrokinetic codes, GENE [T.Gorler et al., J. Comput. Phys. 230 7053-7071 (2011)] and CGYRO [J.Candy et al, J. Comput. Phys. 324 73-93 (2016)], using L-mode plasma profiles from KSTAR for local linear and nonlinear electromagnetic simulations. The focus is on the impact of fast ions and rotation effects on energy flux, aiming to identify the similarities and differences between these codes in the context of turbulence transport research. The analysis shows consistency in linear stability results, fractional changes in energy flux, and zonal shearing between the codes. However, discrepancies arise in absolute thermal energy levels, phase angle distribution, and rotation effects on energy transport, especially in the presence of fast ions. The study underscores the critical importance of phase angle analysis in gyrokinetic code verification, particularly when assessing fast ion effects on turbulence. Additionally, it highlights the need to examine quantities at lower levels of the primacy hierarchy, as discrepancies at higher levels can lead to divergent results at lower levels. These findings indicate the necessity for further investigation into these discrepancies and the novel phase angle structures observed, contributing to the advancement of accurate transport predictions in fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>

      <title>Formation of quasi-single helicity state from a paramagnetic pinch in KTX regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of quasi-single helicity (QSH) state from a paramagnetic pinch in the KTX-RFP regime has been observed in recent NIMROD simulations. The quasi-single helicity state has a dominant helical component of the magnetic field that is known to improve the RFP confinement. For the initial paramagnetic pinch, linear calculations indicate that the tearing mode growth rate decreases with the plasma $\beta$. The initial QSH state arises from the dominant linear instability of the initial force-free paramagnetic pinch. The plasma's self-organization towards the second QSH state after the relaxation of the initial QSH state is found to depend on $\beta$. Specifically, when $\beta&lt;4\%$, the plasma relaxes to an MH state; when $4\% \leq \beta \leq 8\%$, the plasma first transitions from a double axis (DAx) to a single helical axis (SHAx) state, and eventually return to the DAx state. The existence of such an optimal $\beta$ regime that is beneficial to the formation and maintenance of the QSH state, suggests an experimental scheme for the QSH formation based on $\beta$ tuning and control.</description>

      <title>A model of generation of a jet in stratified nonequilibrium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the magnetohydrodynamic approximation, system of equations is proposed which analytically describes the initial stage of origination of axially symmetric directed flows in nonequilibrium stratified plasma. The mechanism of generation is based on the Schwarzschild's convective instability and uses the frozen-in flux condition for magnetic field lines. A solution to the nonlinear equation for the stream function is obtained and analyzed, and it is shown that jets with poloidal velocity fields are generated in such a plasma. The corresponding expressions for the R-dependences of the radial and vertical velocity components in the internal and external regions of the jet include Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. For jets localized in height and radius, the proposed new nonlinear analytical model makes it possible to study their structure and nonlinear dynamics in the radial and vertical directions. The emerging instability in a stratified plasma leads to an increase in the radial and vertical velocities of flows according to the law of the hyperbolic sine. The characteristic growth time depends on the value of the imaginary part of the Brunt-Vyaisyalya frequency. The formation of jets with finite velocity components increasing with time is analyzed. The radial structure of the azimuthal components is determined by the structure of the initial perturbation and can vary with altitude. Along with studying the dynamics of the velocity field, the change in the vertical magnetic field, as well as the dynamics and structure of the emerging toroidal electric current, are investigated.</description>

      <title>Experiment Research on Feasibility of In-Situ Plasma Cleaning in Normal-conducting Copper Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To assess the feasibility of in-situ plasma cleaning for copper cavities, a 13.56 MHz inductively coupled plasma platform with a built-in coil was developed at Tsinghua University. Experiments were conducted using this platform to optimize plasma discharge parameters and procedures specific to copper cavities. The results indicate that the "Ar/O + Ar/H method" significantly enhances the work function of the copper surface while reducing field enhancement effects induced by surface burrs. Consequently, this study confirms that in-situ plasma cleaning effectively mitigates field emission within copper cavities, thereby enhancing the stability and acceleration gradient of the accelerator system.</description>

      <title>Application of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for ITER Burning Plasma Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of burning plasmas in tokamaks are crucial for advancing controlled thermonuclear fusion. This study introduces the NeuralPlasmaODE, a multi-region multi-timescale transport model to simulate the complex energy transfer processes in ITER deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasmas. Our model captures the interactions between energetic alpha particles, electrons, and ions, which are vital for understanding phenomena such as thermal runaway instability. We employ neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) for the numerical derivation of diffusivity parameters, enabling precise modeling of energy interactions between different plasma regions. By leveraging transfer learning, we utilize model parameters derived from DIII-D experimental data, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of our simulations without training from scratch. Applying this model to ITER's inductive and non-inductive operational scenarios, our results demonstrate that radiation and transport processes effectively remove excess heat from the core plasma, preventing thermal runaway instability. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in advancing our understanding and control of burning plasma dynamics in fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Remote detection of radioactive material using a short pulse CO2 laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of radioactive material at distances greater than the radiated particle range is an important goal with applications in areas such as national defense and disaster response. Here we demonstrate avalanche-breakdown-based remote detection of a 3.6 mCi alpha-particle source at a stand-off distance of 10 m, using 70 ps, long wave infrared (lambda=9.2 micron) CO2 laser pulses. This is ~10X longer than our previous results using a mid-IR laser. The primary detection method is direct backscatter from microplasmas generated in the laser focal volume. The backscatter signal is amplified as it propagates back through the CO2 laser chain, enhancing sensitivity by &gt;100X. We also characterize breakdown plasmas with fluorescence imaging, and present a simple model to estimate backscattered signal as a function of the seed density profile in the laser focal volume. All of this was achieved with a relatively long drive laser focal geometry (f/200) that is readily scalable to &gt;100 m.</description>

      <title>Response of negative ion beamlet to RF field in beam extraction region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam-focusing characteristics of negative ion beams have been experimentally investigated with a superimposition of a controlled perturbation of RF field in a filament-arc discharge negative ion source. Oscillations of a negative-ion beamlet width and axis responding to the RF perturbation were observed, which may be a cause of the larger beam divergence angle of the RF negative ion source for ITER. It is pointed out that the oscillation of the beamlet width depends on the perveance and on the RF frequency such that the oscillation is suppressed at perveance-matched conditions and at low RF frequency.</description>

      <title>Convolutional hybrid-PIC modeling of non-neutral plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-neutral plasmas can excite many nonlinear plasma phenomena, e.g., collisionless shocks, sheath layers, solitons, and plasma plumes. It is a fundamental issue in fields such as astrophysics, space physics, nuclear fusion, and plasma propulsion. Hybrid PIC methods are currently the most commonly used techniques for simulating non-neutral plasmas. However, the numerical methods for solving hybrid PIC model of non-neutral plasma have some shortcomings. Here, a new method called convolutional hybrid-PIC (conv-HPIC) is proposed to address this problem. This method replaces the Poisson's equation in the hybrid PIC with a convolution equation. The conv-HPIC method avoids iteration, suppresses numerical noise and exhibits high computational efficiency. It is expected to become a powerful tool for exploring nonlinear phenomena in non-neutral plasmas.</description>

      <title>The effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use particle-in-cell, fully electromagnetic, plasma kinetic simulation to study the effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (ESKHI). The results are applicable to collisionless plasmas when e.g. solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres or magnetic field is generated in AGN jets. We find that as in the case of magnetohydrodynamic KHI, in the kinetic regime, presence of external magnetic field reduces growth rate of the instability. In MHD case there is known threshold magnetic field for KHI stabilization, while for ESKHI this is to be analytically determined. Without a kinetic analytical expression, we use several numerical simulation runs to establish an empirical dependence of ESKHI growth rate, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}$, on the strength of applied external magnetic field. We find the best fit is hyperbolic, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}=\Gamma_0\omega_{\rm pe}/(A+B\bar B_0)$, where $\Gamma_0$ is the ESKHI growth rate without external magnetic field and $\bar B_0=B_0/B_{\rm MHD}$ is the ratio of external and two-fluid MHD stability threshold magnetic field, derived here. An analytical theory to back up this growth rate dependence on external magnetic field is needed. The results suggest that in astrophysical settings where strong magnetic field pre-exists, the generation of an additional magnetic field by the ESKHI is suppressed, which implies that the Nature provides a "safety valve" -- natural protection not to "over-generate" magnetic field by ESKHI mechanism. Remarkably, we find that our two-fluid MHD threshold magnetic field is the same (up to a factor $\sqrt{\gamma_0}$) as the DC saturation magnetic field, previously predicted by fully kinetic theory.</description>

Abstract: We report on attosecond-scale control of high-harmonic and electron emission from plasma mirrors driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle lightwaves at kHz repetition rate. By controlling the waveform of the intense light transient, we reproducibly form a sub-cycle temporal intensity gate at the plasma mirror surface, leading to the observation of extreme ultraviolet spectral continua, characteristic of isolated attosecond pulse generation. We also observe the correlated emission of a waveform-dependent relativistic electron beam, paving the way towards fully lightwave-controlled dynamics of relativistic plasma mirrors.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Kinetic Effects on Current Gradient-Driven Instabilities of Electron Current Layers via Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron current layers form in various natural and laboratory plasmas and are susceptible to several instabilities. Tearing, driven by current gradients, stands out as a prominent instability in these layers and is considered a potential mechanism for magnetic reconnection in collisionless regimes. Electron inertia serves as a non-ideal factor causing magnetic field lines to break and subsequently reconnect. Another mode driven by current gradients, known as the surface-preserving mode, maintains magnetic field topology. We investigated the kinetic effects on these modes in the presence of finite electron temperatures using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations (implemented with the OSIRIS codebase). Temperature stabilizes the tearing mode to a large extent, except at low temperatures, due to increased electron Larmor radius and subsequent magnetic field diffusion. Introducing uniform guide fields revealed that growth rates decrease at higher temperatures due to reduced plasma beta. Conversely, for the surface-preserving mode, growth rates increase with temperature, likely due to enhanced electron flow velocities. Mixed modes, where both tearing and surface-preserving modes coexist, exhibit asymmetric structures characteristic of asymmetric magnetic reconnection. Finally, we propose future research directions building upon our findings.</description>

Abstract: A central issue in the design of tokamaks or stellarators is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. In particular, the space between toroidal field or modular coils that block access to the plasma chamber could be increased by a large factor. The concept of current-potential patches, which was developed in Todd Elder's thesis, provides a method for separating the study of the feasibility of coils with attractive physics properties from the engineering design of specific coils.</description>
