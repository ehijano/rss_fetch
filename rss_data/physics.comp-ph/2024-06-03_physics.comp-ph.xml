      <title>Machine Learning Conservation Laws of Dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation laws are of great theoretical and practical interest. We describe a novel approach to machine learning conservation laws of finite-dimensional dynamical systems using trajectory data. It is the first such approach based on kernel methods instead of neural networks which leads to lower computational costs and requires a lower amount of training data. We propose the use of an "indeterminate" form of kernel ridge regression where the labels still have to be found by additional conditions. We use here a simple approach minimising the length of the coefficient vector to discover a single conservation law.</description>

      <title>From Density Response to Energy Functionals and Back: An ab initio perspective on Matter Under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy functionals serve as the basis for different models and methods in quantum and classical many-particle physics. Arguably, one of the most successful and widely used approaches in material science at both ambient and extreme conditions is density functional theory (DFT). Various flavors of DFT methods are being actively used to study material properties at extreme conditions, such as in warm dense matter, dense plasmas, and nuclear physics applications. In this review, we focus on the warm dense matter regime, which occurs in the core of giant planets and stellar atmospheres, and as a transient state in inertial confinement fusion experiments. We discuss the connection between linear density response functions and free energy functionals as well as the utility of the linear response formalism for the construction of advanced functionals. As a new result, we derive the stiffness theorem linking the change in the intrinsic free energy to the density response properties of electrons. We review and summarize recent works that assess various exchange-correlation (XC) functionals for an inhomogeneous electron gas that is perturbed by a harmonic external field and for warm dense hydrogen using exact path integral quantum Monte Carlo data as an unassailable benchmark. This constitutes a valuable guide for selecting an appropriate XC functional for DFT calculations in the context of investigating the inhomogeneous electronic structure of warm dense matter. We stress that correctly simulating the strongly perturbed electron gas necessitates the correct UEG limit of the XC and non-interacting free-energy functionals.</description>

      <title>Learning protein-ligand unbinding pathways via single-parameter community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of biomolecular complexes, e.g., of protein-ligand (un)binding, requires the understanding of paths such systems take between metastable states. In MD simulation data, paths are usually not observable per se, but need to be inferred from simulation trajectories. Here we present a novel approach to cluster trajectories based on a community detection algorithm that requires the definition of only a single free parameter. Using the streptavidin-biotin complex as benchmark system and the A\textsubscript{2a} adenosine receptor in complex with the inhibitor ZM241385 as an elaborate application, we demonstrate how such clusters of trajectories correspond to pathways, and how the approach helps in the identification of reaction coordinates for a considered (un)binding process.</description>

      <title>Performance assessment of the effective core potentials under the Fermionic neural network: first and second row elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning techniques has driven the emergence of a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo method (referred to as FermiNet), which has manifested high accuracy and strong predictive power in the electronic structure calculations of atoms, molecules as well as some periodic systems. Recently, the implementation of the effective core potential (ECP) scheme in it further facilitates more efffcient calculations in practice. But there still lack comprehensive assessments on the ECP's performance under the FermiNet. In this work, we set sail to ffll this gap by conducting extensive tests on the ffrst two row elements regarding their atomic spectral and molecular properties. Our major ffnding is that in general the qualities of ECPs have been correctly reffected under the FermiNet. Two recently built ECP tables, namely ccECP and eCEPP, seem to prevail on the overall performance. Speciffcally, ccECP performs slightly better on the spectral precision and covers more elements, while eCEPP is more systematically built from both shape and energy consistency, and better treats the core polarisation. On the other hand, the high accuracy of the all-electron calculations is hindered by the absence of relativistic effects as well as the numerical instabilities in some heavier elements. Finally, with further in-depth discussions, we generate possible directions for developing and improving the FermiNet in the near future.</description>

      <title>3-center and 4-center 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals on modern accelerated processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) algorithm for 3-center and 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian atomic orbitals (AOs) with low and high angular momenta $l$ and varying degrees of contraction for graphical processing units (GPUs). This work builds upon our recent implementation of a matrix form of the MD algorithm that is efficient for GPU evaluation of 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian AOs of high angular momenta ($l\geq 4$) [$\mathit{J. Phys. Chem. A}\ \mathbf{127}$, 10889 (2023)]. The use of unconventional data layouts and three variants of the MD algorithm allow to evaluate integrals in double precision with sustained performance between 25% and 70% of the theoretical hardware peak. Performance assessment includes integrals over AOs with $l\leq 6$ (higher $l$ is supported). Preliminary implementation of the Hartree-Fock exchange operator is presented and assessed for computations with up to quadruple-zeta basis and more than 20,000 AOs. The corresponding C++ code is a part of the experimental open-source $\mathtt{LibintX}$ library available at $\mathbf{github.com:ValeevGroup/LibintX}$.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Machine Learning Discovered Nano-circuitry for Nonlinear Ion Transport in Nanoporous Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confined ion transport is involved in nanoporous ionic systems. However, it is challenging to mechanistically predict its electrical characteristics for rational system design and performance evaluation using electrical circuit model due to the gap between the circuit theory and the underlying physical chemistry. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can bridge this gap and produce physics-based nano-circuitry, based on equation discovery from the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck simulation results where an anomalous constructive diffusion-migration interplay of confined ions is unveiled. This bridging technique allows us to gain physical insights of ion dynamics in nanoporous electrodes, such as the non-ideal cyclic voltammetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of precise and fast theory predictions for the LHC, we present an implementation of the MadNIS method in the MadGraph event generator. A series of improvements in MadNIS further enhance its efficiency and speed. We validate this implementation for realistic partonic processes and find significant gains from using modern machine learning in event generators.</description>

      <title>Robust Experimental Signatures of Phase Transitions in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is widely considered to be a promising candidate for a quantum-classical algorithm which could achieve near-term quantum advantage. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
