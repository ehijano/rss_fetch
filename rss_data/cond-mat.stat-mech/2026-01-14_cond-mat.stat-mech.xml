      <title>Level 2.5 large deviations and uncertainty relations for non-Markov self-interacting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the general problem of formulating the dynamical large deviations of non-Markovian systems in a closed form. Specifically, we consider a broad class of ``self-interacting'' jump processes whose dynamics depends on the past through a functional of a state-dependent empirical observable. Exploiting a natural separation of timescales, we obtain the exact (so-called ``level 2.5'') large deviation joint statistics of the empirical measure over configurations and of the empirical flux of transitions. As an application of this general framework, we derive explicit general bounds on the fluctuations of trajectory observables, generalising to the non-Markovian case both thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. We illustrate our theory with simple examples, and discuss potential applications of these results.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Induced Drift and Negative Mobility in Constrained Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study overdamped stochastic dynamics confined by hard reflecting boundaries and show that the combination of boundary geometry and an anisotropic diffusion tensor generically generates directed motion. At the level of individual trajectories, the no-flux condition enforces an oblique reflection at the boundary, which produces a systematic drift parallel to the surface. The resulting local velocity takes the general form $v_B(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{x})^{\!\top}\mathbf{D}\,\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x})$, determined by the diffusion tensor $\mathbf{D}$ and the local boundary geometry encoded in the normal $\mathbf{n}$ and tangent $\mathbf{t}$. While this boundary-induced drift is local, it can accumulate into a macroscopic response, depending on the statistics of boundary encounters. We illustrate how this local boundary-induced drift gives rise to macroscopic transport using a minimal one-dimensional dimer composed of two particles with unequal diffusion coefficients. The repeated collisions act as reflections in configuration space and lead to sustained center-of-mass motion, including regimes of absolute negative mobility under constant forcing.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Mechanism for Transient Anomalous Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon with critical applications in fields such as metallurgy, cell biology, and population dynamics. While standard diffusion is well-understood, anomalous diffusion often requires complex non-local models. This paper investigates a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is linearly dependent on concentration. We demonstrate through a perturbative analysis that this physically-grounded model exhibits transient anomalous diffusion. The system displays a clear crossover from an initial subdiffusive regime to standard Fickian behavior at long times. This result establishes an important mechanism for trasient anomalous diffusion that arises purely from local interactions, providing an intuitive alternative to models based on fractional calculus or non-local memory effects.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization in thermal first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits how isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, assuming that individual eigenstates at the same energy density have identical expectation values of local observables in the limit of large systems. While the ETH apparently holds across a wide range of interacting quantum systems, in this work we show that it requires generalization in the presence of thermal first-order phase transitions. We introduce a class of all-to-all spin models, featuring first-order thermal phase transitions that stem from two distinct mean-field solutions (two ``branches'') that exchange dominance in the many-body density of states as the energy is varied. We argue that for energies in the vicinity of the thermal phase transition, eigenstate expectation values do not need to converge to the same thermal value. The system has a regime with coexistence of two classes of eigenstates corresponding to the two branches with distinct expectation values at the same energy density, and another regime with Schrodinger-cat-like eigenstates that are inter-branch superpositions; these two regimes are separated by an eigenstate phase transition. We support our results by semiclassical calculations and an exact diagonalization study of a microscopic spin model, and argue that the structure of eigenstates in the vicinity of thermal first-order phase transitions can be experimentally probed via non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08381v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale induces infinitesimal parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical model of stochastic search tracks a randomly diffusing "searcher" until it finds a "target." Owing to its many applications across science and engineering, this perennially popular problem has been thoroughly investigated in a variety of models. However, aside from some exactly solvable one-dimensional examples, very little is known if the searcher diffusivity varies in space. For such space-dependent or "heterogeneous" diffusion, one must specify the interpretation of the multiplicative noise, which is termed the It\^{o}-Stratonovich dilemma. In this paper, we investigate how stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity depends on this interpretation. We obtain general formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the stochastic search time and the so-called splitting probabilities assuming that the targets are small or weakly reactive. These asymptotic results are valid for general space-dependent diffusivities in general domains in any space dimension with targets of general shape which may be in the interior or on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theory with stochastic simulations. Our analysis predicts that stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian umbrella quadrature accelerates free-energy calculations across diverse molecular systems and processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased sampling in molecular dynamics simulations overcomes timescale limitations and delivers free-energy landscapes, essential to understand complex atomistic phenomena. However, when applied across diverse systems and processes, biasing protocols often require time- and resource-consuming fine-tuning. In search for robustness, we boost a prominent biasing method, Umbrella Sampling. To estimate the value of an integral, i.e., the free energy, our Bayesian Umbrella Quadrature (BUQ) method iteratively selects gradient samples, i.e., bias locations, that most reduce the posterior integral variance based on a noise-tolerant Gaussian process model, which also effectively interpolates between samples. We validate the method for a conformational change in a small peptide, a water-to-ice phase transition, and a substitution chemical reaction; obtaining excellent accuracies and speedups. To ease adoption of this more automated and universal free-energy method, we interface BUQ with wide-spread simulation packages and share hyperparametrization guidelines.</description>

      <title>Low energy excitations in a long prism geometry: computing the lower critical dimension of the Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general method for studying systems that display excitations with arbitrarily low energy in their low-temperature phase. We argue that in a rectangular right prism geometry, with longitudinal size much larger than the transverse size, correlations decay exponentially (at all temperatures) along the longitudinal dimension, but the scaling of the correlation length with the transverse size carries crucial information from which the lower critical dimension can be inferred. The method is applied in the particularly demanding context of Ising spin glasses at zero magnetic field. The lower critical dimension and the multifractal spectrum for the correlation function are computed from large-scale numerical simulations. Several technical novelties (such as the unexpectedly crucial performance of Houdayer's cluster method or the convenience of using open - rather than periodic - boundary conditions) allow us to study three-dimensional prisms with transverse dimensions up to $L=24$ and effectively infinite longitudinal dimensions down to low temperatures. The value that we find for the lower critical dimension turns out to be in agreement with expectations from both the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and the Droplet model for spin glasses. We argue that our novel setting holds promise in clarifying which of the two competing theories more accurately describes three-dimensional spin glasses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis formulates time evolution of operators through Lanczos coefficients. In practice, however, numerical instability and memory cost limit the number of coefficients that can be computed exactly. In response to these challenges, the standard approach relies on fitting early coefficients to asymptotic forms, but such procedures can miss subleading, history-dependent structures in the coefficients that subsequently affect reconstructed observables. In this work, we treat the Lanczos coefficients as a causal time sequence and introduce a transformer-based model to autoregressively predict future Lanczos coefficients from short prefixes. For both classical and quantum systems, our machine-learning model outperforms asymptotic fits, in both coefficient extrapolation and physical observable reconstruction, by achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. Our model also transfers across system sizes: it can be trained on smaller systems and then be used to extrapolate coefficients on a larger system without retraining. By probing the learned attention patterns and performing targeted attention ablations, we identify which portions of the coefficient history are most influential for accurate forecasts.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>

      <title>Dissipative ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Designing topological edge states in bacterial active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology provides a unifying framework for understanding robust transport through protected edge states arising from nontrivial wavenumber topology. Extending these concepts to active matter, however, remains largely unexplored experimentally, with realizations limited to systems composed of chiral active particles. Here, we realize topological edge states in dense bacterial suspension, which represents a prototypical active matter system, using microfabricated geometrical structures with nontrivial wavenumber topology. Inspired by previous theoretical studies, we constructed a directional kagome network composed of ratchet-shaped channels that induce unidirectional bacterial flow. In this network, we found clear edge localization of bacterial density. A steady-state analysis based on the bacterial transport model and experimentally measured velocity field reveals how the characteristic collective flow generates edge localization. The model also uncovers the topological origin of the observed edge states. By tuning the geometry of the microfabricated networks, we identified directional channel design and network chirality as the key design features essential for the emergence of the edge state. Our results pave the way for establishing a control and design principle of topological transport in such active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08296v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured for a long time that the tectonic plates are in a self-organized state of criticality and that the Gutenberg-Richter (power) law is a manifestation of that. It was recently shown that for a system near criticality, the inequality of their responses toward external driving could indicate proximity to the critical point. In this work, we show with numerical simulations and seismic data analysis that large earthquake events have a tendency to follow events that are highly unequal. We have applied this framework to various tectonically active regions, such as North America, Southern Japan, parts of South-East Asia and Indonesia.</description>

Abstract: Hour-glass clocks do not free-run; they keep time by riding an external rhythm. Motivated by the primordial KaiBC system in cyanobacteria, we study a driven, finite-state molecular clock that advances through a small number of biochemical states under an intrinsic driving energy and a rotating energy landscape set by day-night metabolism. In the continuum limit, coherence is maximized at a resonant operating point where the intrinsic drift matches the driving frequency. In realistic clocks with a finite number of states, discreteness matters: as the rotating landscape sweeps over a lattice of states, it generates a small and high frequency vibration of the collective phase that makes timing inaccurate. Combining the resonant cost with this discreteness penalty yields a trade-off in the number of states: few states are energetically cheap but noisy; many states are precise but costly. The optimum lies at moderate discretization (typically five to fifteen states) and an environmental coupling that is strong enough for responsiveness yet weak enough to avoid large discrete-state vibrations. These design rules rationalize why KaiC's hexameric architecture falls near the predicted optimum and suggest a general principle for hour-glass clocks across organisms.</description>

      <title>Application of the theory of C*-algebras to the emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis reports on progress in rigorously establishing hydrodynamic principles from the microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum many-body systems in a general, non-model-specific manner. Using the C*-algebra framework of statistical mechanics, we treat systems directly in the thermodynamic limit, primarily focusing on quantum lattice models where tools such as Lieb-Robinson bounds yield rigorous statements. We thus provide a proof-of-principle that large-scale behaviours can indeed be seen as emerging from microscopic dynamics, with mathematical proof. We first report on ergodicity results in short-range models with exponentially decaying or finite-range interactions. We show that time-averaged observables converge to their ensemble averages and decorrelate from all other observables almost everywhere within the light-cone defined by Lieb-Robinson bounds. This relaxation property indicates the loss of information at large scales, from which we prove a Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: at the Euler scaling limit of large time and distance, observables project onto hydrodynamic modes (extensive conserved quantities), within correlation functions. These results hold independently of microscopic details, capturing the physical idea that such details are lost at large space-time scales. Regarding finer scales of hydrodynamics, we discuss rigorous lower bounds on the strength of diffusion. We establish a general result on the clustering of n-th order connected correlations within C* dynamical systems. These results are applied to obtain a strictly positive lower bound on the diffusion constant of chaotic open quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. This thesis underlines the universality of hydrodynamic principles, provides a framework for establishing them rigorously, and sets the stage for future progress toward the goal of proving the hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Open quantum spin chains with non-reciprocity: a theoretical approach based on the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an open quantum spin chain with non-reciprocal dissipation using a theoretical approach known as time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble. In the regime of weak dissipation the system is fully characterized by its rapidity distribution and we derive a closed set of coupled differential equations governing their time evolution. We check the accuracy of this theory by benchmarking the results against numerical simulations. Using this framework we are able to compute both the magnetization density and current dynamics, identifying some relations between the two. The problem of the anomalous power-law exponents identified in a previous work is discussed. Our work constitutes a theoretical approach that is able to describe the physics of non-reciprocal open quantum spin chains beyond analyses based on non-interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Collapse of statistical equilibrium in large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At scales larger than the forcing scale, some out-of-equilibrium turbulent systems (such as hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence, and nonlinear optics) exhibit a state of statistical equilibrium where energy is equipartitioned among large-scale modes, in line with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Key open questions now pertain to either the emergence, decay, collapse, or other nonstationary evolutions from this state. Here, we experimentally investigate the free decay of large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves, initially in a regime of statistical equilibrium. Using space- and time-resolved measurements, we show that the total energy of these large-scale tensional waves decays as a power law in time. We derive an energy decay law from the theoretical initial equilibrium spectrum and the linear viscous damping, as no net energy flux is carried. Our prediction then shows a good agreement with experimental data over nearly two decades in time, for various initial effective temperatures of the statistical equilibrium state. We further identify the dissipation mechanism and confirm it experimentally. Our approach could be applied to other decaying turbulence systems, with the large scales initially in statistical equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Well-mixed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) contain many distinct chemical species with copy numbers that fluctuate in correlated ways. While those correlations are typically monitored via Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic trajectories, there is interest in systematically approximating the joint distribution over the exponentially large number of possible microstates using tensor networks or tensor trains. We exploit the tensor network strategy to determine when the steady state of a seven-species gene toggle switch CRN model supports bistability as a function of two decomposition rates, both parameters of the kinetic model. We highlight how the tensor network solution captures the effects of stochastic fluctuations, going beyond mean field and indeed deviating meaningfully from a mean-field analysis. The work furthermore develops and demonstrates several technical advances that will allow steady-states of broad classes of CRNs to be computed in a manner conducive to parameter exploration. We show that the steady-state distributions can be computed via the ordinary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm despite having a non-Hermitian rate operator with a small spectral gap, we illustrate how that steady-state distribution can be efficiently projected to an order parameter that identifies bimodality, and we employ excited-state DMRG to calculate a relaxation timescale for the bistability.</description>

      <title>Mutual Multilinearity of Nonequilibrium Network Currents</title>

Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains have been successful in modelling systems across numerous fields, with currents being fundamental entities that describe the flows of energy, particles, individuals, chemical species, information, or other quantities. They apply to systems described by agents transitioning between vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction). It has recently been shown by the authors that, at stationarity, a hidden linearity exists between currents that flow along edges: if one controls the current of a specific "input" edge (by tuning transition rates along it), any other current is a linear-affine function of the input current [PRL 133, 047401 (2024)]. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one controls the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in linear-affine relation with the input ones. Two proofs with distinct insights are provided: the first relies on Kirchhoff's current law and reduces the input set inductively through graph analysis, while the second utilizes the resolvent approach via a Laplace transform in time. We obtain explicit expressions for the current-to-current susceptibilities, which allow one to map current dependencies through the network. We also verify from our expression that Kirchhoff's current law is recovered as a limiting case of our mutual linearity. Last, we uncover that susceptibilities can be obtained from fluctuations when the reference system is originally at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Symmetry re-breaking in an effective theory of quantum coarsening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple theory accounting for two central observations in a recent experiment on quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator [T. Manovitz et al., Nature \textbf{638}, 86 (2025)]: an apparent speeding up of the coarsening process as the phase transition is approached; and persistent oscillations of the order parameter after quenches within the ordered phase. Our theory, based on the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion in the classical limit of the quantum model, finds a speeding up already deep within the ordered phase, with subsequent slowing down as the domain wall tension vanishes upon approaching the critical line. Further, the oscillations are captured within a mean-field treatment of the order parameter field. For quenches within the ordered phase, small spatially-varying fluctuations in the initial mean-field lead to a remarkable long-time effect, wherein the system dynamically destroys its long-range order and has to coarsen to re-establish it. We term this phenomenon \emph{symmetry re-breaking}, as the resulting late-time magnetization can have a sign opposite to the initial magnetization.</description>

Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Generalized Finite-time Optimal Control Framework in Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems. Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.</description>

Abstract: The coupled entropy, $H_\kappa,$ is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be a measure of the uncertainty at the scale, $\sigma,$ for a class of non-exponential distributions. The coupled stretched exponential distributions, including the generalized Pareto and Student's t distributions, are uniquely parameterized to quantify linear uncertainty with the scale and nonlinear uncertainty with the tail shape for a broad class of complex systems. Thereby, the coupled entropy optimizes the representation of the uncertainty due to linear sources. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven. The uniqueness of the coupled entropy is further supported by demonstrating consistent thermodynamic relationships, which correspond to a model used for the momentum of high-energy particle collisions. Applications of the coupled entropy in measuring statistical complexity, training variational inference algorithms, and designing communication channels are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Spectral mechanism and nearly reducible transfer matrices for pseudotransitions in one-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While true phase transitions are forbidden in one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions, several models have recently been shown to exhibit sharp yet analytic thermodynamic anomalies that mimic thermal phase transitions. We show that this behavior arises from transfer matrices that are mathematically irreducible but possess a nearly block-diagonal structure due to the weak contribution of off-diagonal Boltzmann weights in the low-temperature regime. This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components. In the first case, we derive exact expressions for the pseudo-critical temperature and residual entropy. In the second, we reduce the full $1458\times1458$ transfer matrix via symmetry decomposition and construct a low-rank effective matrix that accurately captures the crossover between quasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-core-ferromagnetic regimes. Our results demonstrate that pseudotransitions can be understood as spectral phenomena emerging from irreducible but functionally decoupled structures within the transfer matrix.</description>

Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving: Lindbladian Simulation with Provable Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta} \propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved in principle by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F.~Chen \emph{et al.}, Nature \textbf{646}, pp.~561--566 (2025)] -- the implementation of these ``exact Gibbs samplers'' requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging \emph{in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices.
  Here, we propose a scheme for approximately simulating an exact Gibbs sampler that only requires the repeated implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous guarantees on the difference between the fixed point reached by our protocol and the exact thermal state, which only depend on parameters of the protocol and its \emph{mixing time}. The procedure is efficiently implementable on near-term devices if $H$ is local, and the mixing time scales mildly with both system size and protocol parameters. While guaranteeing the latter for Hamiltonians of interest remains an important problem for future work, here we lay the groundwork for developing fully efficient thermal state preparation protocols on quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit</title>

Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature.
  We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble.
  Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Wave in the Honeycomb Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: Criticality of Form and Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>Basis dependence of Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description>

      <title>Computing quantum magic of state vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( https://github.com/bsc-quantic/HadaMAG.jl/ ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.</description>
