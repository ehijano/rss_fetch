      <title>Reinforcing Infrastructure Networks with Multicriteria Portfolio Decision Analysis: An Application to Railway Stations in Finland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced societies are crucially dependent on critical infrastructure networks for the reliable delivery of essential goods and services. Hence, well-founded analyses concerning disruptions are needed to guide decisions that seek to ensure the performance of these networks in the face of failures caused by vulnerabilities to external hazards or technical malfunctions. In this setting, we develop a multicriteria decision analysis approach to support the formulation of cost-efficient portfolios of preventive reinforcement actions. Our approach is general in that it (i) allows for multiple objectives, such as those that represent the volume of traffic that is enabled between alternative origin-destination pairs in a transportation network, (ii) uses methods of probabilistic risk assessment to quantify the expected performance of the network, and (iii) solves optimization problems to identify those combinations of reinforcement actions that are cost-efficient in improving the performance of the network, given the available, possibly incomplete information about the relative importance of objectives. Our methodological contributions are illustrated by a case study on the analysis of railway switches at a representative Finnish railway station.</description>

      <title>Feedback Arc Sets and Feedback Arc Set Decompositions in Weighted and Unweighted Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any arc-weighted oriented graph $D=(V(D), A(D),w)$, we write
  ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ to denote the minimum weight of a feedback arc set in $D$. In this paper, we consider upper bounds on ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ for arc-weight oriented graphs $D$ with bounded maximum degrees and directed girth. We obtain such bounds by introducing a new parameter ${\rm fasd}(D)$, which is the maximum integer such that $A(D)$ can be partitioned into ${\rm fasd}(D)$ feedback arc sets. This new parameter seems to be interesting in its own right.
  We obtain several bounds for both ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ and ${\rm fasd}(D)$ when $D$ has maximum degree $\Delta(D)\le \Delta$ and directed girth $g(D)\geq g$. In particular, we show that if $\Delta(D)\leq~4$ and $g(D)\geq 3$, then ${\rm fasd}(D) \geq 3$ and therefore ${\rm fas}_w(D)\leq \frac{w(D)}{3}$ which generalizes a tight bound for an unweighted oriented graph with maximum degree at most 4. We also show that ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ and ${\rm fas}_w(D) \leq \frac{w(D)}{g}$ if $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\geq g$ for $g\in \{3,4,5\}$ and these bounds are tight. However, for $g=10$ the bound ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ does not always hold when $\Delta(D)\leq 3$. Finally we give some bounds for the cases when $\Delta$ or $g$ are large.</description>

      <title>Monk Algebras and Representability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ``Monk Algebras and Ramsey Theory,'' \emph{J. Log. Algebr. Methods Program.} (2022), Kramer and Maddux prove various representability results in furtherance of the goal of finding the smallest weakly representable but not representable relation algebra. They also pose many open problems.
  In the present paper, we address problems and issues raised by Kramer and Maddux. In particular, we prove that their Proposition 7 does not generalize, and we answer Problem 1.1 in the negative: relation algebra $1311_{1316}$ is not representable. Thus $1311_{1316}$ is a good candidate for the smallest weakly representable but not representable relation algebra.
  Finally, we give the first known finite cyclic group representations for relation algebras $31_{37}$, $32_{65}$, $1306_{1314}$, and $1314_{1316}$.</description>

      <title>Stable Set Polytopes with Rank $|V(G)|/3$ for the Lov{\'a}sz--Schrijver SDP Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytope of graphs with respect to the Lov{\'a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$ applied to the fractional stable set polytope. In particular, we show that for every positive integer $\ell$, the smallest possible graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ contains $3\ell$ vertices. This result is sharp and settles a conjecture posed by Lipt{\'a}k and the second author in 2003, as well as answers a generalization of a problem posed by Knuth in 1994. We also show that for every positive integer $\ell$ there exists a vertex-transitive graph on $4\ell+12$ vertices with $\text{LS}_+$-rank at least $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Determining distances and consensus between mutation trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mutational heterogeneity of tumours can be described with a tree representing the evolutionary history of the tumour. With noisy sequencing data there may be uncertainty in the inferred tree structure, while we may also wish to study patterns in the evolution of cancers in different patients. In such situations, understanding tree similarities is a key challenge, and therefore we present an approach to determine distances between trees. Considering the bounded height of trees, we determine the distances associated with the swap operations over strings. While in general, by solving the {\sc Maximum Common Almost $v$-tree} problem between two trees, we describe an efficient approach to determine the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. The inherent noise in current statistical methods for constructing mutation evolution trees of cancer cells presents a significant challenge: handling such collections of trees to determine a consensus tree that accurately represents the set and evaluating the extent of their variability or dispersion. Given a set of mutation trees and the notion of distance, there are at least two natural ways to define the ``target'' tree, such as a min-sum (\emph{median tree}) or a min-max (\emph{closest tree}) of a set of trees. Thus, considering a set of trees as input and dealing with the {\sc median} and {\sc closest} problems, we prove that both problems are \NP-complete, even with only three input trees. In addition, we develop algorithms to obtain upper bounds on the median and closest solutions, which are analysed by the experiments presented on generated and on real databases. We show a fast way to find consensus trees with better results than any tree in the input set while still preserving all internal structure.</description>

      <title>3D-grids are not transducible from planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the class of 3D-grids is cannot be transduced from planar graphs, and more generally, from any class of graphs of bounded Euler genus. To prove our result, we introduce a new structural tool called slice decompositions, and show that every graph class transducible from a class of graphs of bounded Euler genus is a perturbation of a graph class that admits slice decompositions.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable routing in data center networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid network is a static (electronic) network that is augmented with optical switches. The Reconfigurable Routing Problem (RRP) in hybrid networks is the problem of finding settings for the optical switches augmenting a static network so as to achieve optimal delivery of some given workload. The problem has previously been studied in various scenarios with both tractability and NP-hardness results obtained. However, the data center and interconnection networks to which the problem is most relevant are almost always such that the static network is highly structured (and often node-symmetric) whereas all previous results assume that the static network can be arbitrary (which makes existing computational hardness results less technologically relevant and also easier to obtain). In this paper, and for the first time, we prove various intractability results for RRP where the underlying static network is highly structured, for example consisting of a hypercube, and also extend some existing tractability results.</description>
