      <title>Analysis of QCD at finite isospin density: on the relationship between quark degrees of freedom in hadrons and equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quark contribution to the equation of state (EOS) of the isospin QCD matter using the two-flavor quark meson model at finite isospin density. This model includes the quark degrees of freedom through the lowest order of the loop correction. This model describes the crossover of the pion condensate from the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase at low density to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase at high density. In the absence of the quark degrees of freedom the pion condensate behaves as the bosonic object, but the quark substructure becomes important and suppress the pion condensate by Pauli blocking as density increase.
  As the isospin density increases, the EOS rapidly becomes stiff and approaches to the quark matter even before pion starts to overlap. Consequently, the sound velocity exceeds the conformal value $c_s^2 = 1/3$, forming a peak structure and then relax to the conformal value from above at high density. This is in good agreement with the recent lattice QCD (LQCD) result. In contrast, the perturbative QCD (pQCD) result suggests that the sound velocity approaches to the conformal value from below. This discrepancy comes from the non-perturbative effects arising from the pion condensate or the quark-antiquark correlation near the Fermi surface in the quark meson model. We also investigated the trace anomaly as another measure of conformality.
  The effects of finite temperature on sound velocity were also examined. On the isentropic trajectory, where $s/n_I$ is fixed, the thermal quarks were found to suppress the sound velocity and smear out the peak structure. The thermal mesons are considered to be important at zero density from LQCD, which is confirmed in this model calculation. The analysis is further extended to the condensed phase at high density, where it is found that thermal mesons do not significantly contribute to the EOS.</description>

      <title>Exact unified tetraquark equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we formulated covariant equations describing the tetraquark in terms of an admixture of two-body states $D\bar D$ (diquark-antidiquark), $MM$ (meson-meson), and three-body-like states where two of the quarks are spectators while the other two are interacting [Phys. Rev. D 107, 094014 (2023)]. A feature of these equations is that they unify descriptions of seemingly unrelated models of the tetraquark, like, for example, the $D\bar D$ model of the Moscow group [Faustov et al., Universe 7, 94 (2021)] and the coupled channel $D \bar D-MM$ model of the Giessen group [Heupel et al., Phys. Lett. B718, 545 (2012)]. Here we extend these equations to the exact case where $q\bar{q}$ annihilation is incorporated explicitly, and all previously neglected terms (three-body forces, non-pole contributions to two-quark t matrices, etc.) are taken into account through the inclusion of a single $q\bar{q}$ potential $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Seeking a coherent explanation of LHC excesses for compressed spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most recent searches by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in final states with soft leptons and missing transverse energy show mild excesses predominantly associated with dilepton invariant masses of about 10-20 GeV, which can result from decays of electroweakinos that are heavier than the lightest neutralino by O(10) GeV. On the other hand, these analyses are insensitive to electroweakino mass splittings smaller than about 5 GeV. In previous work, we demonstrated that while recent searches in the monojet channel can exclude some of the smallest O(1) GeV mass splitting configurations for electroweakinos, they also exhibit excesses that can overlap with the soft-lepton excesses in certain models, including a simplified scenario with pure higgsinos. In this work we dive deeper into these excesses, studying the analyses in detail and exploring an array of models that go beyond the simplified scenarios considered by the experimental collaborations. We show that, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the overlapping excesses are not unique to the pure-higgsino limit, instead persisting in realistic parameter space featuring a bino-like lightest supersymmetric particle with some wino admixture. On the other hand, for the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with a singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle and higgsino-like next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle(s), the excess in the two-lepton channel fits rather well with the parameter space predicting the correct relic abundance through freeze out, but the monojet fit is much poorer. Interestingly, the excesses either do not overlap or do not exist at all for two non-supersymmetric models seemingly capable of producing the correct final states.</description>

      <title>Triple Higgs boson production and electroweak phase transition in the two-real-singlet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of three Higgs bosons at hadron colliders can be enhanced by a double-resonant effect in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric two-real-singlet extension of the Standard Model, making it potentially observable in future LHC runs. The production rate is maximized for large scalar couplings, which prompts us to carefully reconsider the perturbativity constraints on the theory. This leads us to construct a new set of 140 benchmark points that have a triple Higgs boson production cross-section at least 100 times larger than the SM value.
  Furthermore, we study the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition, both analytically at leading order, and numerically without the high-temperature expansion. Both analyses indicate that a first-order phase transition is incompatible with the requirement that both singlets have a non-zero vev in the present-day vacuum, as required by doubly-enhanced triple Higgs boson production. Allowing instead one of the singlets to remain at zero field value opens up the possibility of a first-order phase transition, while di-Higgs boson production can still be enhanced by a (single) resonance.</description>

      <title>Conversion-driven leptogenesis: A testable theory of dark matter and baryogenesis at the electroweak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomena of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry pose two of the most pressing questions in today's fundamental physics. Conversion-driven freeze-out has emerged as a successful mechanism to generate the observed dark matter relic density. It supports thermalization of dark matter despite its very weak couplings aligning with the null results from direct and indirect detection experiments. In this letter, we demonstrate that the departure from equilibrium of dark matter, induced by semi-efficient conversions, satisfies Sakharov's conditions, providing a novel explanation for both dark matter and the baryon asymmetry. Specifically, for a leptophilic model, we establish the mechanism of conversion-driven leptogenesis. The scenario predicts dark matter masses close to the electroweak scale offering testable predictions, such as soft displaced leptons at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Lighten up Primordial Black Holes in the Galaxy with the QCD axion: Signals at the LOFAR Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the luminosity that results from the conversion of QCD axion particles into photons in the magnetic field of the plasma accreting onto black holes (BHs). For the luminosities to be large two conditions need to be met: i) there are large numbers of axions in the PBH surroundings as a result of the so-called superradiant instability; ii) there exists a point inside the accreting region where the plasma and axion masses are similar and there is resonant axion-photon conversion. For BHs accreting from the interstellar medium in our galaxy, the above conditions require the black hole to have subsolar masses and we are therefore led to consider a population of primordial black holes (PBHs). In the conservative window, where we stay within the non-relativistic behavior of the plasma and neglect the possibility of non-linear enhancement via magnetic stimulation, the typical frequencies of the emitted photons lie on the low-radio band. We thus study the prospects for detection using the LOFAR telescope, assuming the PBH abundance to be close to the maximal allowed by observations. We find that for PBH and QCD axion with masses in the range $10^{-5}-10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ and $4 \times 10^{-8}$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ eV, respectively, the flux density emitted by the closest PBH, assuming it accretes from the warm ionized medium, can be detected at the LOFAR telescope. Coincidently, the PBH mass range coincides with the range that would explain the microlensing events found in OGLE. This might further motivate a dedicated search of these signals in the LOFAR data and other radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Improved Thermal Resummation for Multi-Field Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resummation of large thermal corrections to the effective potential is mandatory for the accurate prediction of phase transitions. We discuss the accuracy of different prescriptions to perform this resummation at the one- and two-loop level and point out conceptual issues that appear when using a high-temperature expansion at the two-loop level. Moreover, we show how a particular prescription called partial dressing, which does not rely on a high-temperature expansion, consistently avoids these issues. We introduce a novel technique to apply this resummation method to the case of multiple mixing fields. Our approach significantly extends the range of applicability of the partial dressing prescription, making it suitable for phenomenological studies of beyond the Standard Model extensions of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Minimal complete tri-hypercharge theories of flavour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tri-hypercharge proposal introduces a separate gauged weak hypercharge assigned to each fermion family as the origin of flavour. This is arguably one of the simplest setups for building "gauge non-universal theories of flavour" or "flavour deconstructed theories". In this paper we propose and study two minimal but ultraviolet complete and renormalisable tri-hypercharge models. We show that both models, which differ only by the heavy messengers that complete the effective theory, are able to explain the observed patterns of fermion masses and mixings (including neutrinos) with all fundamental coefficients being of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. In fact, both models translate the complicated flavour structure of the Standard Model into three simple physical scales above electroweak symmetry breaking, completely correlated with each other, that carry meaningful phenomenology. In particular, the heavy messenger sector determines the origin and size of fermion mixing, which controls the size and nature of the flavour-violating currents mediated by the two heavy $Z'$ gauge bosons of the theory. The phenomenological implications of the two minimal models are compared. In both models the lightest $Z'$ remains discoverable in dilepton searches at the LHC Run 3.</description>

      <title>Up-scattering production of a sterile fermion at DUNE: complementarity with spallation source and direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possible production of a MeV-scale sterile fermion through the up-scattering of neutrinos on nuclei and atomic electrons at different facilities. We consider a phenomenological model that adds a new fermion to the particle content of the Standard Model and we allow for all possible Lorentz-invariant non-derivative interactions (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor) of neutrinos with electrons and first-generation quarks. We first explore the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to this scenario, by simulating elastic neutrino-electron scattering events in the near detector. We consider both options of a standard and a tau-optimized neutrino beams, and investigate the impact of a mobile detector that can be moved off-axis with respect to the beam. Next, we infer constraints on the typical coupling, new fermion and mediator masses from elastic neutrino-electron scattering events induced by solar neutrinos in two current dark matter direct detection experiments, XENONnT and LZ. Under the assumption that the new mediators couple also to first-generation quarks, we further set constraints on the up-scattering production of the sterile fermion using coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering data from the COHERENT experiment. Moreover, we set additional constraints assuming that the sterile fermion may decay within the detector. We finally compare our results and discuss how these facilities are sensitive to different regions of the relevant parameter space due to kinematics arguments and can hence provide complementary information on the up-scattering production of a sterile fermion.</description>

      <title>Study of bottom quark dynamics via non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bottom quark energy loss via the nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The space-time profile of quark-gluon plasma is obtained from the CLVisc hydrodynamics simulation, the dynamical evolution of heavy quarks inside the color deconfined QCD medium is simulated using a linear Boltzmann transport model that combines Yukawa and string potentials of heavy-quark-medium interactions, the hadronization of heavy quarks is performed using a hybrid coalescence-fragmentation model, and the decay of $B$ mesons is simulated via PYTHIA. Using this numerical framework, we calculate the transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependent $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and $v_2$ of direct $D$ mesons, $B$ mesons, and non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ from $B$ meson decay in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We find the mass hierarchy of the nuclear modification of prompt $D$ and $B$ mesons depends on their $p_\mathrm{T}$. Both $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and $v_2$ of heavy flavor particles show strong $p_\mathrm{T}$ and centrality dependences due to the interplay between parton energy loss, medium geometry and flow, and hadronization of heavy quarks. Non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ share similar patterns of $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and $v_2$ to $B$ mesons except for a $p_\mathrm{T}$ shift during the decay processes. Therefore, future more precise measurements on non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ can help further pin down the bottom quark dynamics inside the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decay of $\Omega_b\to\Omega_c~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in three lepton channels. To this end, we use QCD sum rule method in three point framework to calculate the form factors defining the matrix elements of these transitions. Having calculated the form factors as building blocks, we calculate the decay widths and branching fractions of the exclusive decays in all lepton channels and compare the results with other theoretical predictions. The obtained results for branching ratios and ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels may help experimental groups in their search for these weak decays. Comparison of the obtained results with possible future experimental data can be useful to check the order of consistency between the standard model theory predictions and data on the heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Search for Z' Radiating from the Dark Matter at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a collider probe of a dark sector model in which the dark matter is charged under a new, hidden $U(1)$ gauge group. In particular, we look for the so-called Darkstrahlung process, in which the final states dark matter radiates a new $Z'$ gauge boson and it manifests as dilepton resonances. This work emphasizes the potential of dilepton final states with missing transverse energy in probing the darkstrahlung process. We recast the ATLAS Run 2 search for dilepton resonances in association with missing energy in addition to the ATLAS and CMS searches for sleptons. We find that the recasted searches put strong constraints on the coupling between the dark matter and the $Z'$. Moreover, we evaluate refined search strategies for $Z'$ production and propose an analysis employing constraints on the lepton invariant mass and higher missing energy cut related to the darkstrahlung process. Simulation outcomes indicate substantial enhancements, particularly by a factor of 6 in regions featuring lower $Z'$ masses. Finally, we also discuss the case when the $Z'$ has a long lifetime, resulting in displaced decay of the boson.</description>

      <title>Mapping the SMEFT at High-Energy Colliders: from LEP and the (HL-)LHC to the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SMEFiT3.0, an updated global SMEFT analysis of Higgs, top quark, and diboson production data from the LHC complemented by electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) from LEP and SLD. We consider recent inclusive and differential measurements from the LHC Run II, alongside with a novel implementation of the EWPOs based on independent calculations of the relevant EFT contributions. We estimate the impact of HL-LHC measurements on the SMEFT parameter space when added on top of SMEFiT3.0, through dedicated projections extrapolating from Run II data. We quantify the significant constraints that measurements from two proposed high-energy circular $e^+e^-$ colliders, the FCC-ee and the CEPC, would impose on both the SMEFT parameter space and on representative UV-complete models. Our analysis considers projections for the FCC-ee and the CEPC based on the latest running scenarios and includes $Z$-pole EWPOs, fermion-pair, Higgs, diboson, and top quark production, using optimal observables for both the $W^+W^-$ and the $t\bar{t}$ channels. The framework presented in this work may be extended to other future colliders and running scenarios, providing timely input to ongoing studies towards future high-energy particle physics facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear reduced cross section $\sigma^{A}_{r}$, in the kinematic range of the electron-Ion collider with center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=140~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $y{\leq}1$, is discussed. The importance of the nuclear longitudinal structure function $F^{A}_{L}$ and its behavior owing to the impact parameter for the heavy and light nucleus of Pb-208 and C-12 at $Q^2=5$ and $10~\mathrm{GeV}^2$ is considered. The dependence of the ratios $R^{A}_{F_{L}}$ and $R^{A}_{\sigma}$ on the impact parameter and the expanding point of the gluon density at small $x$ are investigated. The factorized form of parton distributions in nuclei is used in HIJING2.0 model.</description>

Abstract: We study Quantum Chromodynamics in the chiral large $N_c$ limit which contains a left-handed Weyl fermion in the fundamental representation, a left-handed Weyl fermion in the two index antisymmetric representation and $(N_c-3)$ left-handed Weyl fermions in the antifundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group. We construct gauge singlet composite operators and study their masses and correlation functions at large $N_c$.
  It is shown that all hadron masses scale as $\sim N_c^0 n_q$ where $n_q$ is the number of constituent quarks in the hadron. In addition by simple gluon exchange considerations it is seen that scattering amplitudes between hadrons have the same $N_c$ scaling as the mass of the lightest hadron involved. This is the case provided the hadrons in the scattering amplitude share a sufficiently large number of constituent quarks.
  The chiral large $N_c$ extension also allows for other non-trivial processes. For instance we consider two different baryonium states that are unique to this extension and that decay via emissions of two- and three-quark hadrons. Also other non-trivial scattering processes are considered. Finally, we study composites made of a mix of left- and right-handed fields. We categorize multiple groups of hadrons within the full spectrum according to their flavor structure. Within these groups all $n$-point functions scale the same.</description>

      <title>Non-extensive statistics in Au-Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle production yields measured in central Au-Au collision at RHIC are obtained with free Fermi and Bose gases and also with a replacement of these statistics by non-extensive statistics. For the latter calculation, a set of different parameters was used with values of the Tsallis parameter $q$ chosen between 1.01 and 1.25, with 1.16 generating the best agreement with experimental data, an indication that non-extensive statistics may be one of the underlying features in heavy ion-collisions.</description>

      <title>Axion-induced Casimir force between nuclei and dynamical axion pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between axions and nuclei by combining the Peccei-Quinn mechanism with results from quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD) which imply that the QCD condensates are reduced within nuclear matter. Thus, the effective axion mass is also reduced, yielding a finite axion-nucleon scattering cross section. Even in the absence of real axions, this interaction would manifest itself in a Casimir type attraction between two nuclei. Finally, accelerated nuclei can create entangled pairs of axions via the dynamical Casimir effect (or as signatures of the Unruh effect).</description>

Abstract: Embedded walls are domain wall solutions which are unstable in the vacuum but stabilized in a plasma of the early Universe. We show how embedded walls in which the electroweak symmetry is restored can lead to an efficient scenario of electroweak baryogenesis. We construct an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which embedded walls exist and are stabilized in an electromagnetic plasma.</description>

      <title>Study of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons in the timelike region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic form factors $G_{\rm E}$ and $G_{\rm M}$ of the proton and neutron in the timelike region are extracted in a study of the processes $e^+ e^-\to \bar{p}p$ and $e^+ e^-\to \bar{n}n$. The reaction amplitude is evaluated within the distorted wave Born approximation, with the interaction of the antinucleon-nucleon ($\bar{N}N$) pair taken into account. The latter is constructed within $SU(3)$ chiral effective field theory up to the next-to-leading order. An excellent description of the $e^+ e^-\to \bar{N}N$ data in the energy region from the $\bar{N}N$ threshold up to center-of-mass energies $E_{\rm cm}=2.2$~GeV is achieved. Results for the electromagnetic form factors $G_{\rm E}, G_{\rm M}$, $G_{\rm E}/G_{\rm M}$, and the subtracted effective form factors, $G_{\rm osc}$, are provided. These can be helpful for further studies of the properties of the nucleons.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extra dimensions theories from gravitational quantum barrier experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the quantum-bouncer experiment involving ultracold neutrons in a braneworld scenario. Extra-dimensional theories typically predict the strengthening of gravitational interactions over short distances. In this paper, we specifically study the anomalous gravitational interaction between the bouncing neutron and the reflecting mirror, resulting from hidden dimensions, and its effect on the outcome of this experiment in the context of a thickbrane model. This analysis allows us to identify which physical quantity of this extra-dimensional theory this neutron experiment is capable of constraining. Based on the experimental data, we found a new and independent empirical bound on free parameters of the model: the higher-dimensional gravitational constant and a parameter related to a transverse width of the confined matter inside the thickbrane. This new bound is valid in scenarios with an arbitrary number of extra dimensions greater than two. In this manner, by considering the thickness of the brane, we have been able to extend previous studies on this topic, which were limited to models with few codimensions, due to non-computability problems of power-law corrections of the gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>The LISA forecast on a smooth crossover beyond the Standard Model through the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supposing the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detector, we exhibit the detectability of a hypothetical smooth crossover in the early universe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics through the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) in terms of the Fisher forecast. A crossover at $\sim100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can leave a signal on the GW spectrum in the $\sim\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency range, the sweet spot of the LISA sensitivity. These possibilities are also interesting in the primordial black hole (PBH) context as the associated PBH mass $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{g}$ lies at the window to explain the whole dark matter. We found that the properties of the crossover can be well determined if the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations are as large as $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ on the corresponding scale $\sim10^{12}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon microscopy in proton-nucleus scattering via analysis of bremsstrahlung emission: role of incoherent emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic form factors of protons in proton-nucleus scattering via analysing of experimental cross-sections of accompanying bremsstrahlung photons. A new bremsstrahlung model for proton-nucleus scattering is developed, where a main focus is given on incoherent bremsstrahlung that has not been considered previously. In analysis we choose experimental bremsstrahlung data of $p$ + $^{197}$Au scattering at proton beam energy of 190 MeV obtained by TAPS collaboration. We find the following. (1) Inclusion of incoherent emission to calculations improves agreements with experimental data essentially, contribution of incoherent bremsstrahlung is essentially larger than coherent one. (2) Inclusion of form factors of the scattered proton improves agreement with experimental data in comparison with calculations with coherent and incoherent contributions without form factors. (3) Sensitivity of model in study of form factors of the scattered proton is high. This demonstrates a new opportunity to study internal structure of protons under influence of nuclear forces in nuclear scattering.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from String T-duality and zero-point length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by String T-duality and taking into account the zero-point length correction, $l_0$, to the gravitational potential, we construct modified Friedmann equations by applying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. The cosmological viability of this extended scenario is investigated by studying influences on the evolution of the early Universe and performing the cosmographic analysis. Furthermore, we explore the inflationary paradigm under the slow-roll condition. By testing the model against observational data, the zero-point length is constrained around the Planck scale, in compliance with the original assumption from String T-duality. We also study the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime. It is shown that the zero-point length stands out as an alternative characterization for the broken-power-law spectrum, which provides a better fitting for the experimental measurements comparing to the simple power-law potential. Finally, we focus on implications for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) spectrum. Should the zero-point length be running over energy scales, as is the case for all parameters and coupling constants in quantum gravity under renormalization group considerations, deviations from General Relativity (GR) might be potentially tested through upcoming PGW observatories.</description>

      <title>Inflation, the Hubble Tension and Early Dark Energy: an alternative overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review and discuss the possible implications for inflation resulting from considering new physics in light of the Hubble tension. My study is motivated by a simple argument that the constraints on inflationary parameters, most typically the spectral index $n_s$, depend to some extent on the cosmological framework. To avoid broadening the uncertainties resulting from marginalizing over additional parameters (typical in many alternative models), I first adopt the same alternative viewpoint of previous studies and analyze what happens if a physical theory can fix extra parameters to non-standard values. Focusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm{eff}}$, I confirm that physical theories able to fix $w \approx -1.2$ or $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.9$ produce values of $H_0$ from CMB and BAO in line with the local distance ladder estimate. While in the former case I do not find any relevant implications for inflation, in the latter scenarios, I observe a shift towards $n_s \approx 1$. From a model-selection perspective, both cases are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models with $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.3 - 3.4$ could bring the $H_0$ tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$ while being moderately disfavored. Yet, this is enough to change the constraints on inflation so that the most accredited models (e.g., Starobinsky inflation) would no longer be favored by data. I then focus on Early Dark Energy (EDE), arguing that an EDE fraction $f_{\rm{EDE}}\sim 0.04 - 0.06$ (only able to mildly reduce the $H_0$-tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$) could already require a similar change in perspective on inflation. In fact, performing a full joint analysis of EDE and Starobinsky inflation, I find that the two models can hardly coexist for $f_{\rm{EDE}}\gtrsim 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclear constraints on the existence and lifetime of a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study to what extent the unique observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei by their weak decay into known $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, with lifetimes of order 10$^{-10}$ s, rules out the existence of a deeply bound doubly-strange (${\cal S}$=$-$2) $H$ dibaryon. Treating ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}$ (the Nagara emulsion event) in a realistic $\Lambda-\Lambda-{^4}$He three-body model, we find that the ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}\to H + {^4{\rm He}}$ strong-interaction lifetime increases beyond 10$^{-10}$ s for $m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$, about 176 MeV below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, so that such a deeply bound $H$ is not in conflict with hypernuclear data. Constrained by $\Lambda$ hypernuclear $\Delta{\cal S}$=1 nonmesonic weak-interaction decay rates, we evaluate the $\Delta{\cal S}$=2 $H\to nn$ weak-decay lifetime of $H$ in the mass range $2m_n \lesssim m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$. The resulting $H$ lifetime is of order 10$^4$ s, many orders of magnitude shorter than required to qualify for a dark-matter candidate. A lower-mass absolutely stable $H$, $m_H\lesssim 2m_n$, is likely to be ruled out by established limits of nuclear stability such as for $^{16}$O.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

Abstract: The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are coherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a suppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We continue study of the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting processes overlap (which is important for understanding corrections to standard treatments of the LPM effect in QCD), avoiding soft-emission approximations. In this particular paper, we show (i) how the "instantaneous" interactions of Light-Cone Perturbation Theory must be included in the calculation to account for effects of longitudinally-polarized gauge bosons in intermediate states, and (ii) how to compute virtual corrections to LPM emission rates, which will be necessary in order to make infrared-safe calculations of the characteristics of in-medium QCD showering of high-energy partons. In order to develop these topics in as simple a context as possible, we will focus in the current paper not on QCD but on large-$N_f$ QED, where $N_f$ is the number of electron flavors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.04120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At high baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, the equation of state of QCD allows a weak-coupling expansion in the QCD coupling $\alpha_s$. The result is currently known up to and including the full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) $\alpha_s^2$. Starting at this order, the computations are complicated by the modification of particle propagation in a dense medium, which necessitates non-perturbative treatment of the scale $\alpha_s^{1/2} \mu_B$. In this work, we apply a Hard-Thermal-Loop scheme for capturing the contributions of this scale to the weak-coupling expansion, and use it to determine the leading-logarithm contribution to NNNLO: $\alpha_s^3 \ln^2 \alpha_s$. This result is the first improvement to the equation of state of massless cold quark matter in 40 years. The new term is negligibly small, and thus significantly increases our confidence in the applicability of the weak-coupling expansion.</description>

      <title>Flavor hierarchy of parton energy loss in quark-gluon plasma from a Bayesian analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quenching of light and heavy flavor hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions probes the color and flavor dependences of parton energy loss through a color-deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and thus reveals the properties of QCD matter at extremely high density and temperature. By combining a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation of parton production, a general ansatz of parton energy loss functions and parton fragmentation functions, we calculate the nuclear modification of various hadron species -- charged hadrons, $D$ mesons and $B$-decayed $J/\psi$ -- over a wide transverse momentum regime. Comparing our calculations to the experimental data using the Bayesian statistical analysis, we perform a first simultaneous extraction of the energy loss functions of gluons ($g$), light quarks ($q$), charm quarks ($c$) and bottom quarks ($b$) inside the QGP. We find that the average parton energy loss at high energies follows the expected hierarchy of $\langle \Delta E_g \rangle &gt; \langle \Delta E_q \rangle \sim \langle \Delta E_c \rangle &gt; \langle \Delta E_b \rangle$, while the parton energy loss distribution can further test the QCD calculations of parton interaction with the dense nuclear matter. We also find that the reduction of experimental uncertainties can significantly improve the precision of the extracted parton energy loss functions inside the QGP.</description>

Abstract: In the context of the production of sneutrinos through Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH), we have studied soft leptogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with heavy right handed neutrinos. Depending upon different conditions on the Hawking evaporation temperature of the PBH and the initial Hawking temperature of the PBH with the sneutrinos's mass which has lepton number violating decay modes, we have discussed how the gravitino problem could be easily avoided in leptogenesis in SUSYGUT theories. For this, one is required to consider that the PBH energy density dominates the energy budget of the universe over the inflaton field. We have shown three possible cases for which the successful generation of baryonic asymmetry is possible. In one case, for the generation of baryonic asymmetry, Shakharov's out-of-equilibrium condition is required whereas in the other two cases, it is found to be not required. The first case is somewhat similar to conventional soft leptogenesis, where for avoiding gravitino problem, $B$ parameter is required to be lower than the weak scale. However in those later two cases, gravitino problem can be easily avoided and the soft breaking $B$ parameter could be naturally at the weak scale for PBH mass greater than about $3 \times 10^{26}$ GeV. From experimental constraint of non-observation of $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, the allowed region of typical mass scale of some supersymmetric particles and the $|A|$ parameter is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Sterile neutrinos, dark matter and Standard Model extended by right-handed neutrinos</title>

Abstract: Joint analysis of the results of the Neutrino-4 experiment and the data of the GALLEX, SAGE and BEST experiments confirms the parameters of neutrino oscillations declared by the Neutrino-4 experiment $(\Delta m_{14}^2= 7.3 \text{eV}^2$ and $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.36)$ and increases the confidence level to $5.8\sigma$. Such a sterile neutrino thermalizes in cosmic plasma, contributes 5% to the energy density of the Universe, and can explain 15-20% of dark matter. It is discussed that the extension of the neutrino model by introducing two more heavy sterile neutrinos in accordance with the number of types of active neutrinos but with very small mixing angles to avoid thermalization will make it possible to explain the large-scale structure of the Universe and bring the contribution of sterile neutrinos to the dark matter of the Universe to the level of 27%. Sterile neutrinos are essentially right-handed neutrinos. The dynamic process of the dark matter generation, consisting of three right-handed neutrinos, is presented. Expansion of the Standard Model by introducing right-handed neutrinos seems possible. The scheme of masses and the scheme of mixing flavors are considered.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Effects on the Squeezing of Axion Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is assumed in standard cosmology that the Universe underwent a period of inflation in its earliest phase, providing the seeds for structure formation through vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field. These fluctuations get stretched by the quasi-exponential expansion of the Universe and become squeezed. The aim of this paper is to deepen the understanding of the squeezing process, considering the effect of self-interactions. Axion-like particles can provide a useful setup to study this effect. Specifically we focus on the consequences that a non-trivial evolution of the background axion field has on the squeezing of the perturbations. We follow the evolution of the axion's fluctuation modes from the horizon exit during inflation to the radiation-dominated epoch. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and squeezing parameters, which are linked to the axion particle number and isocurvature perturbation. We find that the quantum mechanical particle production and the squeezing of the perturbations are enhanced, if one accounts for anharmonic effects, i.e., the effect of higher order terms in the potential. This effect becomes particularly strong towards the hilltop of the potential.</description>

Abstract: Tetraquarks, bound states composed of two quarks and two antiquarks, have been the subject of intense study but are challenging to understand from first principles. We apply variational and Green's function Monte Carlo methods to compute tetraquark ground-state energies in potential nonrelativistic QCD using a wide range of color and spatial wavefunctions. We find no evidence for bound tetraquarks composed of equal-mass quarks and antiquarks. Conversely, we find clear evidence for the existence of bound tetraquarks for sufficiently unequal quark/antiquark mass ratios at all overall mass scales where our effective theory results are applicable. We predict the critical mass ratios for bound state formation and study tetraquark bound states' spatial and color structure at leading order and next-to-leading order in potential nonrelativistic QCD.</description>

      <title>Probing dark photons from a light scalar at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the minimal $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model (SM), a new gauge boson referred to as "dark photon" is predicted. The dark-photon mass can be generated from an additional Higgs mechanism associated with a dark scalar boson. At $B$-factories such as Belle II, large numbers of $B$-mesons are produced and can decay to a kaon plus the dark scalar via the latter's mixing with the SM Higgs boson. We evaluate the sensitivity of Belle II for the case in which the dark scalar decays exclusively into a pair of dark photons via the new $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and the dark photons are long lived owing to a small kinetic mixing $\epsilon$. We study the experimental signature in which each dark photon decays into a pair of charged leptons, pions, or kaons, resulting in a pair of displaced vertices, and argue that the search is essentially background-free. We perform detailed Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the expected number of signal events at Belle II with an integrated luminosity of 50 ab$^{-1}$, taking into account the efficiencies for both final-state-particle identification and displaced tracking. We find that for experimentally allowed values of the scalar mixing angle and kinematically allowed dark-photon and dark-scalar masses, the proposed search is uniquely sensitive to the medium-$\epsilon$ regime, which is currently mostly unexcluded by experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the four-fermion operators via the transverse double spin asymmetry at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chirality-flipping operators of light fermions are currently poorly constrained by experimental analyses due to the lack of interference with Standard Model (SM) amplitudes in traditional observables. In this work, we propose to investigate the semi-leptonic scalar/tensor four-fermion operators of electron and quarks through the transverse double spin asymmetry (DSA) at Electron-Ion Collider, where both the electron and proton beams could be highly transversely polarized. Due to the chirality-flipping nature of these operators, we demonstrate that their interference with the SM results in an unsuppressed contribution to the DSA, and could lead to non-trivial azimuthal $\cos2\phi$ and $\sin2\phi$ distributions that are linearly dependent on their Wilson coefficients. This new method has the potential to significantly improve the current constraints on these scalar/tensor four-fermion operators without relying on theoretical assumptions about other types of new physics effects, particularly for the tensor type operator of the $u$-quark. Additionally, our findings indicate that both the real and imaginary parts of these operators can be simultaneously constrained and offer a new opportunity for probing potential $CP$-violation effects. However, it is important to note that these results would be sensitive to the quark transversity distributions, which are currently poorly constrained by the experimental data, but could be significantly improved at the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. Therefore, our work opens up a new avenue to utilize this new spin asymmetry for exploring the new physics effects from the scalar/tensor four-fermion operators.</description>

      <title>On the two-loop penguin contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of four-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Next-to-Leading Order (two-loop) contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of $\Delta F = 1$ four-quark operators in QCD. We devise a test for anomalous dimensions, that we regard as of general interest, and by means of which we detect a problem in the results available in the literature. Deconstructing the steps leading to the available result, we identify the source of the problem, which is related to the operator known as $Q_{11}$. We show how to fix the problem and provide the corrected anomalous dimensions. With the insight of our findings, we propose an alternative approach to the one used in the literature which does not suffer from the identified disease, and which confirms our corrected results. We assess the numerical impact of our corrections, which happens to be in the ballpark of $5\%$ in certain entries of the evolution matrix. Our results are important for the correct resummation of Next-to-Leading Logarithms in analyses of physics beyond the Standard Model in $\Delta F = 1$ processes, such as the decays of Kaons and $B$-mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental hints and theoretical frameworks indicating the existence of an extended Higgs sector, we undertake a study to explore the feasibility of detecting a 95 GeV light Higgs boson decaying into diphoton within the Minimal Dilaton Model (MDM) at the 14 TeV LHC. Initially, we identify the correlations between the production cross section, decay branching ratios, and model parameters, e.g., the scalar mixing angle $\sin\theta_S$. Subsequently, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations to generate the signal of the light Higgs boson via the process $pp \to t\bar{t}(s\to \gamma\gamma)$, along with the corresponding backgrounds. To effectively separate the signal from the dominant backgrounds $tt\gamma\gamma$, we employ a meticulous cut-based selection process. Ultimately, we find that with an integrated luminosity of $L = 3000 \fbm$, the regions of $|\sin\theta_S|&gt;0.2$ can be covered at over a $3\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Running Coupling and Running Quark Mass Effects on the Elastic Form Factors of Nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the elastic electric and magnetic form factors of the proton, neutron and the charged roper resonance ($G_E^p$, $G_M^p$, $G_E^n$, $G_M^n$, $G_E^R$ and $G_M^R$) systematically in a constituent quark model. Three ingredients are crucial in this study: i) the mixing between the pure S-wave and other components which produces a nonzero neutron electric form factor. ii) a running coupling constant that soften the form factors. iii) the running quark mass function, $M_q(p^2)$, which is responsible for the decreasing of the $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ as $Q^2$ increases. The produced elastic form factors of the proton and neutron match the corresponding observed values fairly well. Our study shows that $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2) \approx M_q(Q^2/9)/M_q(0)$ upto $Q^2 \approx 4 \text{ GeV}^2$. We give predictions on the elastic form factors of the roper resonance, the electric charge and the magnetic momentum radius ratios of the roper resonance to the proton are $r^R_{E}/r^p_{E} \approx r^R_{M}/r^p_{M} \approx 1.5$.</description>

      <title>On the addition of a large scalar multiplet to the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the addition of a single $SU(2)$ multiplet of complex scalar fields to the Standard Model (SM). We explicitly consider the various possible values of the weak isospin $J$ of that multiplet, up to and including $J = 7/2$. We allow the multiplet to have arbitrary weak hypercharge. The scalar fields of the multiplet are assumed to have no vacuum expectation value; the mass differences among the components of the multiplet originate in its coupling, present in the scalar potential (SP), to the Higgs doublet of the SM. We derive exact bounded-from-below and unitarity conditions on the SP, thereby constraining those mass differences. We compare those constraints to the ones that may be derived from the oblique parameters.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Wu-Yang approach to magnetic charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wu-Yang fiber bundle approach to magnetic charge has an overlooked feature -- a disk-like sheet current density and associated magnetic field in the overlap region between the Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere, where the different vector potentials connect. This disk magnetic field plays a role similar to the Dirac string in the Dirac approach to magnetic charge - it brings an inward magnetic flux of $4 \pi g$ which then gives rise to an outward flux of $4 \pi g$ from the Coulomb magnetic field. As with the Dirac string approach we show that placing an electric charge near this disk magnetic field gives rise to a non-zero electromagnetic field momentum. Thus the Wu-Yang approach is seen to be a Coulomb magnetic field plus a disk magnetic field, in a manner similar to the Dirac approach which has a Coulomb magnetic field plus a string magnetic field. We discuss some of the possible consequences of this. We conclude by showing that the non-singular, but non-single valued Banderet monopole potential also has a disk-like singularity and non-zero electromagnetic field momentum in the presence of an electric charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an effective field theory describing a pair of gravitationally interacting point particles in an expansion in their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. The 0SF dynamics are trivially obtained to all orders in Newton's constant by the geodesic motion of the light body in a Schwarzschild background encoding the gravitational field of the heavy body. The corrections at 1SF and higher are generated by perturbations about this configuration -- that is, the geodesic deviation of the light body and the fluctuation graviton -- but crucially supplemented by an operator describing the recoil of the heavy body as it interacts with the smaller companion. Using this formalism we compute new results at third post-Minkowskian order for the conservative dynamics of a system of gravitationally interacting massive particles coupled to a set of additional scalar and vector fields.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background from Primordial Black Holes in R-Symmetric $SU(5)$ Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the realization of nonminimally coupled Higgs inflation in the context of no-scale supergravity, investigates the formation of primordial black holes, and examines the potential for observable proton decay within the framework of the R-symmetric $SU(5)$ model. For inflation, both single and multifield scenarios are investigated. The prediction of the single-field model for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, is approximately $10^{-3}$, and the scalar spectral index falls within Plank's 1$\sigma$ range. The running of the scalar spectral index, $-{dn_{s}}/{d\ln{k}}$, is approximately $10^{-4}$. A realistic scenario of reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis is employed with reheat temperature $T_r\sim10^9$ GeV. In the multifield case, we mainly focus on Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Gravitational Waves (GWs). In this inflationary framework, we demonstrate how a suitable choice of parameters can result in an enhanced scalar power spectrum, leading to the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) capable of fully accounting for dark matter. We also show that this scenario leads to Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW) which can be detected in current and future GW detectors. We explore different proton decay channels to look for observable predictions for the next-generation proton decay experiments Hyper-K and DUNE consistent with gauge coupling unification and cosmological bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming missions probing the absolute intensity of the CMB are expected to be able to measure spectral distortions, which are deviations from its blackbody distribution. As cosmic inflation can induce spectral distortions, these experiments offer a possibility to further test the various promising inflationary proposals, whose predictions need to be carefully determined. After numerically fitting all inflationary observables to match current observations, we compute the predicted spectral distortions of various promising single and multifield inflationary models. The predictions of single-field inflationary models display deviations between 0.5% and 20% with respect to the standard cosmological model in the observable window, where multi-natural and axion-monodromy inflation stand out in this respect. In the case of multifield inflation, we observe a richer structure of the power spectrum, which, in the case of so-called hybrid attractors, yields spectral distortions about 100 times more intense than the standard signal. These observations open up questions about the relation among our results and other cosmological observables that are also to be probed soon, such as the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation and study the possibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit Hilbert space in one of larger dimension. The results are illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>
