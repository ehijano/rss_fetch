      <title>On multipoint Ward identities for superconformal line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconformal Ward identities are revisited in the context of superconformal line defects. Multipoint correlators of topological operators inserted on superconformal lines are studied. In particular, it is known that protected operators preserving enough of the supersymmetry become topological after performing a topological twist. By definition, such a correlator is constant in the topological limit. By analysing the topological constraint on the OPE of such operators, the correlator is further constrained away from this limit. The constraints on multipoint correlators match the known superconformal Ward identities in the case of 4-point functions. This allows for an simple and universal derivation of the superconformal Ward identities governing the multipoint correlation functions of such operators. This concept is illustrated by 1/2-BPS operators with an $su(2)$ R-symmetry and further explored in the case of the displacement multiplet on the 1/2-BPS Wilson line in 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory supporting the conjectured multipoint Ward identities in the literature.</description>

      <title>Complementarity for a Dynamical Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity posits that the interior of a black hole is not independent from its Hawking radiation. This leads to an apparent violation of causality: the interior can be acausally affected by operators acting solely on the radiation. We argue that this perspective is misleading and that the black hole interior must be viewed as existing in the causal past of the Hawking radiation, despite the fact that they are spacelike separated in the semiclassical description. Consequently, no operation on the Hawking radiation -- no matter how complex -- can affect the experience of an infalling observer. The black hole interior and the radiation only appear spacelike separated in the semiclassical description because an infalling observer's ability to access complex information is limited; the chaotic dynamics on the horizon, as viewed from the exterior, then converts any effect caused by such an observer to information in the Hawking radiation which cannot be accessed at the semiclassical level. We arrive at the picture described above by considering a unitary exterior description in which the flow of information is strictly causal, which we extend to apply throughout the entire history of black hole evolution, including its formation. This description uses the stretched event horizon as an inner edge of spacetime, on which the information inside is holographically encoded. We argue that the global spacetime picture arises from coarse-graining over black hole microstates, and discuss its relationship with the exterior description.</description>

      <title>Ramp from Replica Trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spectral form factor of the modular Hamiltonian $K=-\ln\rho_A$ associated to the reduced density matrix of a Haar random state. A ramp is demonstrated and we find an analytic expression for its slope. Our method involves an application of the replica trick, where we first calculate the correlator $&lt;\text{tr}\rho_A^n\;\text{tr}\rho_A^m&gt;$ at large bond dimension and then analytically continue the indices $n,m$ from integers to arbitrary complex numbers. We use steepest descent methods at large modular times to extract the ramp. The large bond dimension limit of the replicated partition function is dominated by a sum over \emph{annular non-crossing permutations}. We explored the similarity between our results and calculations of the spectral form factor in low dimensional gravitational theories where the ramp is determined by the double trumpet geometry. We find there is an underlying resemblance in the two calculations, when we interpret the annular non-crossing permutations as representing a discretized version of the double trumpet. Similar results are found for an equilibrated pure state in place of the Haar random state.</description>

      <title>On 5D Black Brane Stabilities from M-theory on Three Parameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reconsider the study of 5D black branes in M-theory compactifications by means of $N=2$ supergravity formalism. Precisely, we provide a model relaying on a three parameter Calabi-Yau manifold in the $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ projective space factorization, referred to as economical model. First, we investigate the stability of 5D BPS and non-BPS black holes obtained from wrapped M2-branes on non-holomorphic two-cycles in such a Calabi-Yau manifold. Then, we approach the stability of 5D black strings derived from wrapped M5-branes on non-holomorphic four-cycles. Among others, we find various stable and unstable black brane solutions depending on the charge regions of the involved moduli space.</description>

      <title>Taub-NUT Instanton as the Self-dual Analog of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that a certain vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetime, which may be regarded as a self-dual analog of the Kerr metric, is equivalent to the self-dual Taub-NUT instanton. We confirm this conjecture by applying the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm to each metric and showing that for suitable choices of null tetrad, the algorithm leads to the same invariants and linear isotropy groups for both, establishing their equivalence. While it is well-known that the Taub-NUT solution and its self-dual version admit a double Kerr-Schild form, the observation that the self-dual Taub-NUT instanton admits a single Kerr-Schild form has only been made very recently. The two metrics we compare may be regarded as either complex metrics with Lorentzian (1,3) signature or real metrics with Kleinian (2,2) signature; here we take the latter view. Significant simplifications occur when the null tetrads are chosen to consist of two pairs of complex conjugate null vectors rather than four real independent ones. As a bonus, our work provides the first example of applying the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm using a null tetrad of this type.</description>

      <title>On the measurements in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that certain aspects of the measurement require revision in Quantum Gravity. Using entropic arguments, we propose that the number of measurement outcomes and the accuracy (or the range) of the measurement are limited by the entropy of the black hole associated with the observer scale. This also implies the necessity of modifying the algebra of commutation relationships to ensure a finite representation of observables, changing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in this manner.</description>

      <title>Confinement Phenomena in Topological Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing the strong nuclear force and the interactions among quarks and gluons. Topological stars, characterized by extreme density conditions, offer a unique environment where QCD phenomena play a crucial role due to the confinement of fundamental particles. Understanding these phenomena is essential for unraveling the behavior and properties of these celestial bodies.
  In this study, we explore the implications of QCD within extreme density regimes, focusing on its contribution to the energy-momentum tensor ($T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{QCD}}$) within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics. Our analysis sheds light on how these QCD effects influence the fabric of spacetime in the vicinity of topological stars, providing valuable insights into their underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Localization of $q$-form field on squared curvature gravity domain wall brane coupling with gravity and background scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a $q$-form field, represented as $\displaystyle X_{M_1M_2...M_q}$, where $\displaystyle q$ indicates the number of indices, with special cases $\displaystyle q = 0, 1, 2$ corresponding to the scalar fields, vector fields, and Kalb-Ramond fields, respectively. Unlike the duality observed between scalar and vector fields in four-dimensional spacetime, $q$-form fields in higher dimensions correspond to a wider array of particles. We propose a novel localized Kaluza-Klein decomposition approach for the $q$-form field in a five-dimensional spacetime, considering its coupling with gravity and background scalar fields. This methodology enables the successful localization of the $q$-form field on a domain wall brane, leading to the derivation of zero modes, Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations, and a four-dimensional effective action. Additionally, in order to stand for the coupling of the $q$-form field with gravity and scalar fields of the background spacetime, we propose a new coupling function $F(R,\varphi)$. Our analysis highlights the significance of the parameters $\displaystyle C_2$ and $\displaystyle t$ in the localization process.</description>

      <title>Non-hyperbolic 3-manifolds and 3D field theories for 2D Virasoro minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 3D-3D correspondence, we construct 3D dual bulk field theories for general Virasoro minimal models $M(P,Q)$. These theories correspond to Seifert fiber spaces $S^2 ((P,R-P),(Q,-S),(3,1))$ with two integers $(R,S)$ satisfying $PS-QR =1$. In the unitary case, where $|P-Q|=1$, the bulk theory has a mass gap and flows to a unitary topological field theory (TQFT) in the IR, which is expected to support the chiral Virasoro minimal model at the boundary under an appropriate boundary condition. For the non-unitary case, where $|P-Q|&gt;1$, the bulk theory flows to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 superconformal field theory, whose topologically twisted theory supports the chiral minimal model at the boundary. We also provide a concrete field theory description of the 3D bulk theory using $T[SU(2)]$ theories. Our proposals are supported by various consistency checks using 3D-3D relations and direct computations of various partition functions.</description>

      <title>Doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang models, Born-selfdual $\kappa$-deformed quantum phase spaces and two generalizations of Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that by using two different realizations of $\hat{o}(1,4)$ Lie algebra one can describe one-parameter standard Snyder model and two-parameter $\kappa$-deformed Snyder model. In this paper, by using the generalized Born duality and Jacobi identities we obtain from the $\kappa$-deformed Snyder model the doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang model which provides the new class of quantum relativistic phase spaces. These phase spaces contain as subalgebras the $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space-time as well as quantum $\tilde{\kappa}$-deformed fourmomenta and are depending on five independent parameters. Such a large class of quantum phase spaces can be described in $D=4$ by particular realizations of $\hat{o}(1,5)$ algebra, what illustrates the property that in noncommutative geometry different $D=4$ physical models may be described by various realizations of the same algebraic structure. Finally, in the last Section we propose two new ways of generalizing Yang models: by introducing $\hat o(1,3+2N)$ algebras ($N=1,2\ldots$) we provide internal symmetries $O(N)$ symmetries in Kaluza-Klein extended Yang model, and by replacing the classical $\hat{o}(1,5)$ algebras which describe the algebraic structure of Yang models by $\hat o(1,5)$ quantum groups with suitably chosen nonprimitive coproducts.</description>

      <title>Gravitational higher-form symmetries and the origin of hidden symmetries in Kaluza-Klein compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in presence of isometries and non-trivial topology, the Einstein--Hilbert action is invariant under certain transformations of the metric which are not diffeomorphisms. These transformations are similar to the higher-form symmetries of field theories with $p$-form fields. In the context of toroidal Kaluza--Klein compactifications, we show that these symmetries give rise to some of the ``hidden symmetries'' (dualities) of the dimensionally-reduced theories.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction in De Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk reconstruction program involves expressing local bulk fields as non-local operators on the boundary. It was initiated in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. Attempts to extend it to de Sitter have been successful for heavy(principal series) scalar fields. For other fields, the construction ran into issues. In particular, divergences were found to appear for higher spin fields. In this paper, we resolve these issues and obtain boundary representations for scalars of all masses as well as higher spin fields. We trace the origin of the previously discovered divergences and show that the smearing function becomes distributional for certain values of mass, spin and dimension. We also extend the construction from Bunch-Davies vacuum to all $\alpha$-vacua.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of false vacuum decay in arbitrary dimensions, in the presence of gravity, and compute the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation, generalising the results of Coleman and de Luccia. In the particular case of one compact dimension, we present explicit formulae for the Euclidean Bounce configuration that drives the transition from a de Sitter to Minkowski or from a Minkowski to anti-de Sitter vacua.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the (ambi-)twistor model for spinning particles interacting via electromagnetic field, as a toy model for studying classical dynamics of gravitating bodies including effects of both spins to all orders. We compute the momentum kick and spin kick up to one-loop order and show precisely how they are encoded in the classical eikonal. The all-orders-in-spin effects are encoded as a dynamical implementation of the Newman-Janis shift, and we find that the expansion in both spins can be resummed to simple expressions in special kinematic configurations, at least up to one-loop order. We confirm that the classical eikonal can be understood as the generator of canonical transformations that map the in-states of a scattering process to the out-states. We also show that cut contributions for converting worldline propagators from time-symmetric to retarded amount to the iterated action of the leading eikonal at one-loop order.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Janus and RG-flow interfaces from matter-coupled F(4) gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Janus solutions from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets and $SO(4)\sim SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. There are two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua preserving all supersymmetries with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries dual to $N=2$ SCFTs in five dimensions. We consider a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\subset SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ singlet scalars and find a number of new supersymmetric Janus solutions preserving eight supercharges. These solutions holographcally describe conformal interfaces within $N=2$ five-dimensional SCFTs involving deformations by source terms and vacuum expectation values of relevant and irrelevant operators. Apart from the Janus solutions interpolating between $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ $AdS_6$ vacua, some of the solutions have $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $AdS_6$ vacua generated by holographic RG flows from the $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ phases on both sides. We also provide an evidence for solutions describing RG-flow interfaces with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ $AdS_6$ vacuum on one side and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $AdS_6$ vacuum on the other side.

      <title>Unorientable topological gravity and orthogonal random matrix universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>

      <title>Classifying post-Minkowskian geometries for gravitational waves via loop-by-loop Baikov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the loop-by-loop Baikov representation to investigate the geometries in Feynman integrals contributing to the classical dynamics of a black-hole two-body system in the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity. These geometries determine the spaces of functions to which the corresponding Feynman diagrams evaluate. As a proof of principle, we provide a full classification of the geometries appearing up to three loops, i.e. fourth post-Minkowskian order, for all diagrams relevant to the conservative as well as the dissipative dynamics, finding full agreement with the literature. Moreover, we show that the non-planar top topology at four loops, which is the most complicated sector with respect to integration-byparts identities, has an algebraic leading singularity and thus can only depend on non-trivial geometries through its subsectors.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Calabi-Yau four folds with hybrid and recurrent neural network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report the results of applying deep learning based on hybrid convolutional-recurrent and purely recurrent neural network architectures to the dataset of almost one million complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds (CICY4) to machine-learn their four Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$. In particular, we explored and experimented with twelve different neural network models, nine of which are convolutional-recurrent (CNN-RNN) hybrids with the RNN unit being either GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The remaining four models are purely recurrent neural networks based on LSTM. In terms of the $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$ prediction accuracies, at 72% training ratio, our best performing individual model is CNN-LSTM-400, a hybrid CNN-LSTM with the LSTM hidden size of 400, which obtained 99.74%, 98.07%, 95.19%, 81.01%, our second best performing individual model is LSTM-448, an LSTM-based model with the hidden size of 448, which obtained 99.74%, 97.51%, 94.24%, and 78.63%. These results were improved by forming ensembles of the top two, three or even four models. Our best ensemble, consisting of the top three models, achieved the accuracies of 99.80%, 98.40%, 95.80%, 83.02%. At 80% training ratio, the top two performing models LSTM-448 and LSTM-424 are both LSTM-based with the hidden sizes of 448 and 424. Compared with the 72% training ratio, there is a significant improvement of accuracies, which reached 99.85%, 98.66%, 96.26%, 84.77% for the best individual model and 99.88%, 98.91%, 96.96%, 86.78% for the best ensemble.</description>

      <title>Necessity of Quantizable Geometry for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Dirac Quantization of $3D$ gravity in the first-order formalism is attempted where instead of quantizing the connection and triad fields, the connection and the triad 1-forms themselves are quantized. The exterior derivative operator on the space of differential forms is treated as the `time' derivative to compute the momenta conjugate to these 1-forms. This manner of quantization allows one to compute the transition amplitude in $3D$ gravity which has a close, but not exact, match with the transition amplitude computed via LQG techniques. This inconsistency is interpreted as being due to the non-quantizable nature of differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Arrow of Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discussions of the arrow of time often get quite confusing due to highly complex systems they deal with. Popular literature then often coveys messages that tend to get lost in translation. The purpose of this note is to demystify the arrow of time by stripping off the unnecessary complexities and thereby simplifying the discussion. We do this by providing examples that are exactly solvable and make it easy to see the root cause of the apparent "time-irreversibility". We also discuss "time-reversal" solutions, where the initial state evolves such that it reaches the state which is the same as the initial state moving backward in time. These solutions are simple enough to be comprehensible to a highschooler. We discuss the arrow of time both in the classical and quantum settings, including in the cosmological context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic dark energy models have proven to be a very interesting way to study various aspects of late-time acceleration of the universe. In this work we extensively study HDE models with the Granda-Oliveros cutoff with an ansatz based approach. We consider the Tsallis, Barrow and PLEC HDE models in this regard and consdier simple power law, emergent universe, intermediate and logamediate forms of for the universe. Studying various cosmologically interesting parameters alongside the thermodynamical aspects in these models, we show that the Logamediate models are the best fit out of the other possibilites, followed by the emergent universe model, intermediate model and the simple power law models at the very last in terms of feasibility.</description>

      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for CSS and fractonic lattice models and dualities via cluster state measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov radiation for parallel motion in three-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study delves into the modifications observed in Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov radiation when its generating charged particle moves parallel to an interface formed by two generic magnetoelectric media, focusing on topological insulators. We compute the electromagnetic field through the Green's function. Applying the far-field approximation and the steepest descent method, we derive analytical expressions for the electric field, revealing contributions from spherical and lateral waves with topological origins. Subsequently, we analyze the angular distribution of the radiation, particularly focusing on parallel motions in close proximity to the interface. Our findings indicate that the radiation along the Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov cone is inhomogeneous and asymmetric. We analyze the radiated energy at both sides of the interface. Finally, we discuss the particle's retarding force, which is notably enhanced in the ultrarelativistic regime. We illustrate these results for the topological insulator TlBiSe$_2$ and the magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly realize the Rep($Q_8$) non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state as a 1+1d cluster state on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits. Using the Kramers-Wannier operator, we construct the lattice models for the phases of all the symmetries in the Rep($Q_8$) duality web. We further show that we can construct a class of lattice models with Rep($G$) symmetry including non-invertible SPT phases if they have a dual anomalous abelian symmetry. Upon dualizing, there is a rich interplay between onsite symmetries, non-onsite symmetries, non-abelian symmetries, and non-invertible symmetries. We show that these interplay can be explained using the symmetry fractionalization in the 2+1d bulk SET.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing. The main result of this study is that no further scalar mode appears more than the two standard plus and cross transverse polarizations of massless tensor gravitational radiation, typical of General Relativity. This is because the first-order perturbation of connection does not modify the linearized field equations in vacuum which remain gauge invariant. Then, the world line equations of free point particles, as well as the equations of their deviations, are obtained using only the symmetric teleparallel connection. In $f(Q)$ gravity, test masses follow timelike geodesics and not autoparallel curves. In the proper reference frame, thanks to the geodesic deviation equation of the structure-less bodies in free fall, we prove that, in any gauge, only the metric perturbations $h_{\mu\nu}$, related to tensor modes, survive by exploiting the gauge invariance. Besides, scalar modes disappear. This allows us to conclude that only two degrees of freedom of linearized $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity propagate as in General Relativity and in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The situation is different with respect to $f(R)$ gravity (with $f(R)\neq R$) where a further scalar mode is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vector boson dark matter particles which stem from some broken gauge symmetries usually requires some unbroken symmetries to keep themselves stable. In the previous literature, some simplest cases have been discussed, in which the unbroken symmetry is provided by a remnant subgroup of the gauge group. It would be interesting to ask whether all the possible remnant subgroups as well as all the possible coupling forms can be enumerated. Classifying all the Higgs components into different mass degenerate representations to simplify the diagonalization processes is also necessary. Rather than the ambitious target of providing a general solution to all kinds of gauge groups configured with all forms of the Higgs multiplets, in this paper, we concentrate on the case of $\text{SU(2)}_{\text{D}}$ gauge group together with a single Higgs multiplet. We enumerate all possible discrete subgroups that can survive up to $n=21$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Higgs multiplet. We also provide the general algorithms to enumerate all possible renormalizable operators, to write down the general forms of the vacuum expectation value (VEV) configurations, and to give the detailed results of all the mass degenerate irreducible representations embedded in the Higgs multiplet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum states under dynamical evolution can be investigated by studying the spread with time of the state over a pre-defined basis. It is known that this complexity is minimised by choosing the Krylov basis, thus defining the spread complexity. We study the dynamics of spread complexity for quantum maps using the Arnoldi iterative procedure. The main illustrative quantum many-body model we use is the periodically kicked Ising spin-chain with non-integrable deformations, a chaotic system where we look at both local and non-local interactions. In the various cases we find distinctive behaviour of the Arnoldi coefficients and spread complexity for regular vs. chaotic dynamics: suppressed fluctuations in the Arnoldi coefficients as well as larger saturation value in spread complexity in the chaotic case. We compare the behaviour of the Krylov measures with that of standard spectral diagnostics of chaos. We also study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the complexity saturation.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the hard QCD contributions to the pion gravitational form factors (GFFs), in terms of the twist-2,3 pion distribution amplitudes (DA), including novel semi-hard contributions from the instantons. The pion DAs are evaluated in the QCD instanton vacuum, and then properly evolved to higher resolution. The results are compared to our recent results from the QCD instanton vacuum, as well as Bethe-Salpeter calculations and recent lattice data. The interpolated hard and soft contributions to the pion D-form-factor, are used to derive the (gravitational) pressure and shear within the pion, with a clear delineation of their range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circuit model of quantum computation can be interpreted as a scattering process. In particular, factorised scattering operators result in integrable quantum circuits that provide universal quantum computation and are potentially less noisy. These are realized through Yang-Baxter or 2-simplex operators. A natural question is to extend this construction to higher qubit gates, like the Toffoli gates, which also lead to universal quantum computation but with shallower circuits. We show that unitary families of such operators are constructed by the 3-dimensional generalizations of the Yang-Baxter operators known as tetrahedron or 3-simplex operators. The latter satisfy a spectral parameter-dependent tetrahedron equation. This construction goes through for $n$-Toffoli gates realized using $n$-simplex operators.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell inequality violation in vector diboson systems produced in decays of spin-0 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss entanglement and the violation of the CGLMP inequality in a system of two vector bosons produced in the decay of a spin-0 particle. We assume the most general CPT conserving, Lorentz-invariant coupling of the spin-0 particle with the daughter bosons. We compute the most general two-boson density matrix obtained by averaging over kinematical configurations with an appropriate probability distribution (which can be obtained when both bosons subsequently decay into fermion-antifermion). We show that the two-boson state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constants and that in this case the state is entangled iff it can violate the CGLMP inequality. As an exemplary process of this kind we use the decay $H\to ZZ$ with anomalous coupling.</description>

      <title>On deformation quantization of the space of connections on a two manifold and Chern Simons Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use recent progress on Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions [18] to give explicit, closed form formulas for the star product on some functions on the affine space ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma)$ of (smooth) connections on the trivialized principal $G$-bundle on a compact, oriented two manifold $\Sigma.$ These formulas give a close relation between knot invariants, such as the Kauffman bracket polynomial, and the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, arising in Chern Simons gauge theory, and deformation quantization of ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma).$ This relation echoes the relation between the manifold invariants of Witten [20] and Reshetikhin-Turaev [16] and {\em geometric} quantization of this space (or its symplectic quotient by the action of the gauge group). In our case this relation arises from explicit algebraic formulas arising from the (mathematically well-defined) functional integrals of [18].</description>

      <title>Bounding Dark Energy from the SPARC rotation curves: Data driven probe for galaxy virialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy (DE) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper bound on DE studies its resistance to the attractive gravitational force from dark matter. Using the SPARC dataset, we fit the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist models to identify the most suitable galaxies for these models. Introducing the presence of DE in these galaxies helps establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper bound on DE sits around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. We discuss the conditions for detecting DE in different systems and show the consistency of the upper bound from galaxies to other systems. The upper bound is of the same order of magnitude as $\rho_{200} = 200 \rho_c$ for both dark matter profiles. We also address the implications for future measurements on that upper bound and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>The Chern-Simons Functional Integral, Kauffman's Bracket Polynomial, and other link invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Chern-Simons Gauge Theory in axial gauge on ${\mathbb R}^3.$ This theory has a quadratic Lagrangian and therefore expectations can be computed nonperturbatively by explicit formulas, giving an (unbounded) linear functional on a space of polynomial functions in the gauge fields, as a mathematically well-defined avatar of the formal functional integral. We use differential-geometric methods to extend the definition of this linear functional to expectations of products of Wilson loops corresponding to oriented links in ${\mathbb R}^3,$ and derive skein relations for them. In the case $G=SU(2)$ we show that these skein relations are closely related to those of the Kauffman bracket polynomial, which is closely related to the Jones polynomial. We also study the case of groups of higher rank. We note that in the absence of a cubic term in the action, there is no quantization condition on the coupling $\lambda,$ which can be any complex number. This is in line with the fact that the Jones polynomial, in contrast to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, is defined for any value of the coupling. The appearance of the parameter $e^{\frac1{2\lambda}}$ in the expectations and skein relations is also natural. Likewise, the extension of the theory to noncompact groups presents no difficulties. Finally we show how computations similar to ours, but for gauge fields in two dimensions, yield the Goldman bracket.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in magnetized black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Comisso-Asenjo mechanism is a novel mechanism proposed recently to extract energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection of the surrounding charged plasma, in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role. In this work, we revisit this process by taking into account the backreaction of the magnetic field on the black hole's geometry. We employ the Kerr-Melvin metric to describe the local near-horizon geometry of the magnetized black hole. By analyzing the circular orbits in the equatorial plane, the energy extraction conditions, the power and efficiency of the energy extraction, we found that while a stronger magnetic field can enhance plasma magnetization and aid energy extraction, its backreaction on the spacetime may hinder the process, with a larger magnetic field posing a greater obstacle. Balancing these effects, an optimal moderate magnetic field strength is found to be most conducive for energy extraction. Moreover, there is a maximum limit to the magnetic field strength associated with the black hole's spin, beyond which circular orbits in the equatorial plane are prohibited, thereby impeding energy extraction in the current scenario.</description>

Abstract: Wave equations for some curved spacetimes may involve functions that prevent a solution in a closed form. In some cases, these functions can be eliminated by transformations and the solutions can be found analytically. In the cases where such transformations are not available, the infinite series expansions of these functions can be convoluted with the power series solution ansatz. We study such an example where the solution is based on a special function.</description>

Abstract: We derive the geometric quantization program of symplectic manifolds, in the sense of both Kostant-Souriau and Weinstein, from Feynman's path integral formulation on phase space. The state space we use contains states with negative norm and polarized sections determine a Hilbert space. We discuss ambiguities in the definition of path integrals arising from the distinct Riemann sum prescriptions and its consequence on the quantization of symplectomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Potential of the Polyakov Loop in SU(3) Quenched Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical manner for the first time. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value with no source term. In particular, we deal with the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, just corresponding to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into each of $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method where gauge configurations around each vacuum are separately used. We eventually obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we will explore the effects of non-commutativity in fractional classical and quantum schemes using the anisotropicc Bianchi Type I cosmological model coupled to a scalar field in the K-essence formalism. We introduce non-commutative variables considering that all minisuperspace variables $q^i_{nc}$ do not commute, so the symplectic structure was modified, resulting in some changes with respect to the traditional formalism. In the quantum regime, the probability density presents a new structure in the scalar field corresponding to the value of the non-commutative parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjectured classification of topological phases in two spatial dimensions with gappable boundary, in a simplified setting. Two gapped ground states of lattice Hamiltonians are in the same quantum phase of matter, or topological phase, if they can be connected by a constant-depth quantum circuit. It is conjectured that the Levin-Wen string-net models exhaust all possible gapped phases with gappable boundary, and these phases are labeled by unitary modular tensor categories. We prove this under the assumption that every phase has a representative state with zero correlation length satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, or a strict form of area law. Our main technical development is to transform these states into string-net states using constant-depth quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>A universal constraint on axion non-Abelian dynamics during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models equipped with Chern-Simons coupling between their axion and gauge sectors exhibit an array of interesting signals including a testable chiral gravitational wave spectrum. The energy injection in the gauge sector triggered by the rolling axion leads to a well-studied enhancement of gauge field fluctuations. These may in turn affect observables such as the scalar and tensor spectra and also account for non-linear corrections to field propagators. In this work, we focus on non-Abelian gauge sectors. We show that gauge field self-interactions and axion-gauge field non-linear couplings significantly renormalize the gauge field mode function. Operating within the regime of validity of the perturbative treatment places strong constraints on the accessible parameter space of this class of models. We calculate corrections to the gauge field propagator that are universally present in these scenarios. Enforcing perturbativity on such propagators leads to bounds that are competitive with those stemming from analytical estimates on the onset of the strong backreaction regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of crystalline symmetry, topologically ordered states can acquire a host of symmetry-protected invariants. These determine the patterns of crystalline symmetry fractionalization of the anyons in addition to fractionally quantized responses to lattice defects. Here we show how ground state expectation values of partial rotations centered at high symmetry points can be used to extract crystalline invariants. Using methods from conformal field theory and G-crossed braided tensor categories, we develop a theory of invariants obtained from partial rotations, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. We then perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations for projected parton wave functions of fractional Chern insulators, demonstrating remarkable agreement between theory and numerics. For the topological orders we consider, we show that the Hall conductivity, filling fraction, and partial rotation invariants fully characterize the crystalline invariants of the system. Our results also yield invariants of continuum fractional quantum Hall states protected by spatial rotational symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We develop a formalism to extract triple crossing symmetric positivity bounds for effective field theories with multiple degrees of freedom, by making use of $su$ symmetric dispersion relations supplemented with positivity of the partial waves, $st$ null constraints and the generalized optical theorem. This generalizes the convex cone approach to constrain the $s^2$ coefficient space to higher orders. Optimal positive bounds can be extracted by semi-definite programs with a continuous decision variable, compared with linear programs for the case of a single field. As an example, we explicitly compute the positivity constraints on bi-scalar theories, and find all the Wilson coefficients can be constrained in a finite region, including the coefficients with odd powers of $s$, which are absent in the single scalar case.</description>

Abstract: We study a three-dimensional holographic CFT under the influence of a background electric field on a spacetime containing two black hole horizons. The electric background is fixed such that there is potential difference between the two boundary black holes, inducing a conserved current. By constructing the holographic duals to this set-up, which are solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant in four dimensions, we calculate, to a fully non-linear level, the conductivity of the CFT in this background. Interestingly, we find that the conductivity depends non-trivially on the potential difference. The bulk solutions are flowing geometries containing black hole horizons which are non-Killing and have non-zero expansion. We find a novel property that the past boundary of the future horizon lies deep in the bulk and show this property remains present after small perturbations of the temperature difference of the boundary black holes.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Model of Quantum Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum model of the Schwarzschild black hole as a quantum mechanics of a system of fermionic degrees of freedom. The system has a constant density of states and a Fermi energy that is inversely proportional to the size of the system. Assuming equivalence principle, we show that the degeneracy pressure of the Fermi degrees of freedom is able to withstand the collapse of gravity if the radius of the system is given precisely by the horizon radius of the Schwarzschild black hole. In our model, the fermionic degrees of freedom at each energy level can be entangled in certain different ways, giving rise to a multitude of degenerate ground states of the system. The counting of these microstates reproduces precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This simple Fermi model is universal and works also for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om charged black hole as well as black hole with a cosmological constant. From the properties of the Fermi variables, we propose that quantum gravity is characterized by a principle of {\it maximal capacity of states} where there can be no more than $V /l_P^3$ quantum states in any volume $V$. It implies a loss of spatial locality below the Planck length and suggests that any singularity predicted by general relativity is resolved and replaced by a quantum space in quantum gravity. In our model, a black hole spacetime is equipped with an uniform distribution of energy levels. This is another reason why black hole can be considered a simple harmonic oscillator of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Influence Functional in open holography: entanglement and R\'enyi entropies</title>

Abstract: Open quantum systems are defined as ordinary unitary quantum theories coupled to a set of external degrees of freedom, which are introduced to take on the r\^ole of an unobserved environment. Here we study examples of open quantum field theories, with the aid of the so-called Feynman- Vernon Influence Functional (IF), including field theories that arise in holographic duality. We interpret the system in the presence of an IF as an open effective field theory, able to capture the effect of the unobserved environment. Our main focus is on computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies in such systems, whose description from the IF, or "open EFT", point of view we develop in this paper. The issue of computing the entanglement-R\'enyi entropies in open quantum systems is surprisingly rich, and we point out how different prescriptions for the IF may be appropriate depending on the application of choice. A striking application of our methods concerns the fine-grained entropy of subsystems when including gravity in the setup, for example when considering the Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. In this case we show that one prescription for the IF leads to answers consistent with unitary evolution, while the other merely reproduces standard EFT results, well known to be inconsistent with unitary global evolution. We establish these results for asymptotically AdS gravity in arbitrary dimensions, and illustrate them with explicit analytical expressions for the IF in the case of matter-coupled JT gravity in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new formalism to solve the kinematical constraints due to Weyl invariance for CFTs in curved backgrounds and/or non-trivial states, and we apply it to thermal CFTs and to CFTs on squashed spheres. The ambient space formalism is based on constructing a class of geometric objects that are Weyl covariant and identifying them as natural building blocks of correlation functions. We construct (scalar) $n$-point functions and we illustrate the formalism with a detailed computation of 2-point functions. We compare our results for thermal 2-point functions with results that follow from thermal OPEs and holographic computations, finding exact agreement. In our holographic computation we also obtain the OPE coefficient of the leading double-twist contribution, and we discuss how the double-twist coefficients may be computed from the multi-energy-momentum contributions, given knowledge of the analytic structure of the correlator. The 2-point function for the CFT on squashed spheres is a new result. We also discuss the relation of our work to flat holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum junction described by a 1+1-dimensional boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). Our analysis focuses on correlations emerging at finite temperature, achieved through the computation of entanglement measures. Our approach relies on characterizing correlation functions of twist fields using BCFT techniques. We provide non-perturbative predictions for the crossover between low and high temperatures. An intriguing interplay between bulk and boundary effects, associated with the bulk/boundary scaling dimensions of the fields above, is found. In particular, the entanglement entropy is primarily influenced by bulk thermal fluctuations, exhibiting extensiveness for large system sizes with a prefactor independent of the scattering properties of the defect. In contrast, negativity is governed by fluctuations across the entangling points only, adhering to an area law; its value depends non-trivially on the defect, and it diverges logarithmically as the temperature is decreased. To validate our predictions, we numerically check them for free fermions on the lattice, finding good agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interrelation between topology and Narain T-duality of heterotic flux vacua. We present evidence that all 5 and 4-dimensional Minkowski space heterotic flux backgrounds with 8 supercharges have a locus in the moduli space with a T-dual description in terms of a compactification on the product of a K3 surface with a circle or a torus. A test of this equivalence is provided by calculating the new supersymmetric index on both sides of the duality. We examine the implications of these dualities for CHL-like orbifolds that reduce the rank of the gauge group, as well as those that lead to minimal supersymmetry in 4 dimensions. We also discuss properties of flux vacua that preserve minimal supersymmetry in 4 dimensions that cannot be related to conventional compactifications by Narain T-duality. Along the way we point out a number of properties of these vacua, including the role played by non-trivial flat gerbes, the appearance of rational worldsheet CFTs in decompactification limits, and the role of attractive K3 surfaces in backgrounds with minimal supersymmetry. Finally, we discuss the dual pairs from the perspective of M-theory/heterotic duality.</description>

Abstract: Gradient Flow Exact Renormalization Group (GF-ERG) is a framework to define the renormalization group flow of Wilsonian effective action utilizing coarse-graining along the diffusion equations. We apply it for Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics and derive flow equations for the Wilsonian effective action with the perturbative expansion in the gauge coupling. We focus on the quantum corrections to the correlation functions up to the second order of the gauge coupling and discuss the gauge invariance of the GF-ERG flow. We demonstrate that the anomalous dimension of the gauge field agrees with the standard perturbative computation and that the mass of the photon keeps vanishing in general spacetime dimensions. The latter is a noteworthy fact that contrasts with the conventional Exact Renormalization Group formalism in which an artificial photon mass proportional to a cutoff scale is induced. Our results imply that the GF-ERG can give a gauge-invariant renormalization group flow in a non-perturbative way.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spatially inhomogeneous solutions in a top-down holographic model: the D3/D7 model which provides a holographic description of the chiral phase transition for a finite external magnetic field, chemical potential, and temperature. We numerically find a domain wall (or kink) solution in the three dimensional space, which incorporates between the chiral symmetry broken phase at the spatial infinity, under the homogeneous sources. Along with the inhomogeneity of the chiral condensate, the charge density is also spatially modulated. The modulated charge density and finite magnetic field lead to the chiral edge current close to the domain wall. We explore the dependences of those profiles on the chemical potential and temperature near the first and second order phase transition points. Our results indicate that the inhomogeneous solutions we found are in good agreement with those obtained by the Ginzburg--Landau theory in the vicinity of the transition points.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to flavoured BPS black hole thermodynamics and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Cardy-like regime of the four-dimensional superconformal index has been shown to be governed by 't Hooft anomalies and to single out a large-$N$ saddle carrying the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of dual supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5$. For the universal index where no flavour fugacities are turned on, this correspondence has been improved by matching the first subleading corrections to the saddle-point action with the four-derivative corrections to the black hole action in minimal gauged supergravity, as well as the respective corrected entropies. Here, we extend this match by including flavour symmetries. We consider five-dimensional gauged supergravity with vector multiplet and four-derivative couplings, and provide an effective theory reproducing the 't Hooft anomalies of the R- and flavour symmetries of generic holographic superconformal field theories at next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. Then we focus on a specific model dual to $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_\nu$ quiver gauge theories, where the 't Hooft anomaly coefficients receive simple but sufficiently generic corrections. In this model, we evaluate the four-derivative corrections to the on-shell action of the supersymmetric multi-charge black hole, showing agreement with the flavoured Cardy-like formula from the index. We give a prediction for the corrected entropy of the supersymmetric black hole and discuss the general validity of our results. Taking the limit of infinite AdS$_5$ radius, we also obtain four-derivative corrections to the action and entropy of supersymmetric asymptotically flat black holes.</description>

Abstract: Multi-parameter families of $\mathcal{N}=0$ Type IIA and Type IIB AdS$_5$ solutions are presented, promoting to $\mathcal{N}=1$ in some special cases. The G-Structure description of each $\mathcal{N}=1$ solution is given, requiring an Abelian T-Duality of the G-Structure conditions and Pure Spinors. Investigations at the boundaries are performed for a two-parameter family of Type IIA and a three-parameter family of Type IIB solutions, finding the presence of orbifold singularities in some backgrounds. All parameters drop out of the Holographic Central Charge calculation, pointing to marginal deformations in the dual CFT description.</description>

      <title>Four-Derivative Yang-Mills Couplings in Heterotic Theory through T-Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the dimensional reduction of the classical effective action of heterotic string theory on a circle, along with its T-duality symmetry, with the aim of identifying the bosonic couplings. To achieve this, we propose a truncation scheme for the generalized Buscher rules and the reduced action, specifically targeting the truncation of the nonlinear appearance of the scalar component of the Yang-Mills field in the base space. By imposing this truncated T-duality on the reduced action, we successfully determine the four-derivative bosonic couplings in the minimal basis, where field redefinition is imposed. Notably, these couplings, which are associated with the Lorentz Chern-Simons coupling $H\Omega$, exhibit an exact correspondence with the NS-NS couplings found in the Metsaev-Tseytlin action.
  Furthermore, we investigate the bosonic couplings in the maximal basis, where field redefinition is not imposed. In this scenario, the truncated T-duality fixes the effective action up to 17 arbitrary parameters. By assigning specific values to these parameters, we establish a framework in which the NS-NS couplings align with those in the Meissner action. Remarkably, within this scheme, the Yang-Mills couplings precisely coincide with those obtained through the S-matrix method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, our focus is on exploring the gauge invariant basis for bosonic couplings within the framework of heterotic string theories, specifically examining 3-, 5-, and 7-derivative terms. We thoroughly analyze the invariance of these couplings under T-duality transformations and make a notable observation: the T-duality constraint enforces the vanishing of these couplings. We speculate that this result likely holds true for all higher odd-derivative couplings as well. This is unlike the result in type I superstring theory, where, for example, the couplings of 5 Yang-Mills field strength are non-zero.</description>

Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetry provide powerful tool to constrain the dynamics of quantum systems, such as anomaly matching in the renormalization group flow and obstruction to symmetric mass generation. In this note we compute the anomalies in 2+1d time-reversal symmetric gauge theories with massless fermions in the fundamental and rank-two tensor representations, where the gauge groups are $SU(N),SO(N),Sp(N),U(1)$. The fermion parity is part of the gauge group and the theories are bosonic. The time-reversal symmetry satisfies $T^2=1$ or $T^2={\cal M}$ where ${\cal M}$ is an internal magnetic symmetry.
  We show that some of the bosonic gauge theories have time-reversal anomaly with $c_-\neq 0$ mod 8 that is absent in fermionic systems. The anomalies of the gauge theories can be nontrivial even when the number of Majorana fermions is a multiple of 16 and $\nu=0$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Symmetry Breaking: Unequal Probabilities of Vacuum Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental notion in modern physics, ranging from high energy to condensed matter. However, the usual spontaneous symmetry breaking only considers the equal probability to select the vacua. In this work, we conceive a model to realize the unequal probability of the symmetry breaking, leading to an unbalanced number of ground states. Specifically, we study the probabilities of a scalar field to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. As the whole system is subject to random perturbations, we find that the probability for the field to roll down to the left or right side depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on the examination of the island rule within the context of four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (4D RN-AdS) black holes, illuminating the intricate relationship between the entanglement entropy and phase transitions of black holes. The entanglement entropy of 4D RN-AdS black holes follows the anticipated linear growth pattern before ultimately declining to a constant value, in accordance with the well-established Page curve. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the influence, previously unexplored, of the first-order phase transition on the shape and evolution of the Page curve in situations involving both eternal and evaporating black holes. Despite the morphological alterations of the curve induced by the transition, the inherent unitarity of the system persists. As the evaporation progresses, the Page curve displays diverse configurations, unveiling phenomena that are novel and defies traditional expectations, thereby enriching our comprehension of the thermodynamics of black holes interlinked with quantum information.</description>

Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window around 5 e-folds for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <title>The fate of boundary terms in dimensional reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>

      <title>'Just another field theory' approach to $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills and the origin of intrinsic SuperGeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-geometric derivation of $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills by focusing on the consistency of interactions that extend the free vector supermultiplet rather than assuming gauge invariance under extended symmetries. By utilizing a superspace first-order description, the theory is given in closed form as a third-order polynomial which includes a single cubic interaction term instead of an infinite series, thus eliminating the need for a special gauge. The geometrical interpretation of the theory emerges, as opposed to being presupposed.</description>

      <title>A new approach to topological T-duality for principal torus bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new `Thom class' formulation of topological T-duality for principal torus bundles. This definition is equivalent to the established one of Bunke, Rumpf, and Schick but has the virtue of removing the global assumptions on the H-flux required in the old definition. With the new definition, we provide easier and more transparent proofs of the classification of T-duals and generalise the local formulation of T-duality for circle bundles by Bunke, Schick, and Spitzweck to the torus case.</description>

      <title>Natural dynamical reduction of the three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem is a fundamental long-standing open problem, with applications in all branches of physics, including astrophysics, nuclear physics and particle physics. In general, conserved quantities allow to reduce the formulation of a mechanical problem to fewer degrees of freedom, a process known as dynamical reduction. However, extant reductions are either non-general, or hide the problem's symmetry or include unexplained definitions. This paper presents a dynamical reduction that avoids these issues, and hence is general and natural. Any three-body configuration defines a triangle, and its orientation in space. Accordingly, we decompose the dynamical variables into the geometry (shape + size) and orientation of the triangle. The geometry variables are shown to describe the motion of an abstract point in a curved 3d space, subject to a potential-derived force and a magnetic-like force with a monopole charge. The orientation variables are shown to obey a dynamics analogous to the Euler equations for a rotating rigid body, only here the moments of inertia depend on the geometry variables, rather than being constant. The reduction rests on a novel symmetric solution to the center of mass constraint inspired by Lagrange's solution to the cubic. The formulation of the orientation variables is novel and rests on a little known generalization of the Euler-Lagrange equations to non-coordinate velocities. Applications to global features, to the statistical solution and to special exact solutions are presented. A generalization to the four-body problem is presented.</description>

      <title>Radiative processes of single and entangled detectors on circular trajectories in (2+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative processes involving two entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors that are moving on circular trajectories in $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We assume that the detectors are coupled to a massless, quantum scalar field, and calculate the transition probability rates of the detectors in the Minkowski vacuum as well as in a thermal bath. We also evaluate the transition probability rates of the detectors when they are switched on for a finite time interval with the aid of a Gaussian switching function. We begin by examining the response of a single detector before we go on to consider the case of two entangled detectors. As we shall see, working in $(2+1)$ spacetime dimensions makes the computations of the transition probability rates of the detectors relatively simpler. We find that the cross transition probability rates of the two entangled detectors can be comparable to the auto transition probability rates of the individual detectors. We discuss specific characteristics of the response of the entangled detectors for different values of the parameters involved and highlight the effects of the thermal bath as well as switching on the detector for a finite time interval.</description>

      <title>Addressing Six Standard Model Problems with Technically Natural Higgs Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to study the potential of the recently proposed model framework, called Technically Natural Higgs (TNH), in addressing six fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. These questions encompass the electroweak (EW) naturalness problem, neutrino mass generation, nature of the inflaton, the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem, origin of dark matter (DM) and the strong CP problem. We investigate various solutions within the TNH framework for three inflation scenarios $ - $ Higgs, Starobinsky and scale-independent inflation. In the minimal TNH model, the Higgs is a mixture of an elementary and a composite state, with a compositeness scale far exceeding the EW scale. Traditionally, this has required an unnatural small vacuum misalignment, but in the TNH framework a novel mechanism enables a technically natural large compositeness scale, even up to the Planck scale. In this model framework, we demonstrate that a scale-invariant version of the minimal TNH model, featuring a special energy scale of around $ \mathcal{O}(10^{12}) $ GeV, loop-induced by the inflaton, simultaneously yields a technically natural 125-GeV Higgs boson, scotogenic neutrinos, a scale-invariant inflaton and a QCD axion DM candidate. These components dynamically generate the Planck scale and collectively have the potential to address all six open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Via Andersen-Borot-Orantin's geometric recursion, a twist of the topological recursion was proposed, and a recursion for the Masur-Veech polynomials was uncovered. The purpose of this article is to explore generalizations of Mirzakhani's recursion based on physical two-dimensional gravity models related to the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to provide an introduction to various realizations of topological recursion. For generalized Mirzakhani's recursions involving a Masur-Veech type twist, we derive Virasoro constraints and cut-and-join equations, and also show some computations of generalized volumes for the physical two-dimensional gravity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss entanglement and violation of Bell-type inequalities for a system of two $Z$ bosons produced in Higgs decays. We take into account beyond the Standard Model (anomalous) coupling between $H$ and daughter bosons but we limit ourselves to an overall scalar $ZZ$ state (we exclude the possibility that $H$ contains a pseudo-scalar component). In particular we consider the case when each $Z$ decays further into fermion-antifermion pair. We find that a $ZZ$ state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse several aspects of detectors with uniform acceleration $a$ and uniform rotation $\Omega$ in de Sitter ($\Lambda&gt;0$) and anti-de Sitter ($\Lambda&lt;0$) spacetimes, focusing particularly on the periodicity, in (Euclidean) proper time $\tau_{\rm traj}$, of geodesic interval $\tau_{\rm geod}$ between two events on the trajectory. For $\Lambda&lt;0$, $\tau_{\rm geod}$ is periodic in ${\rm i} \tau_{\rm traj}$ for specific values of $a$ and $\Omega$. These results are used to obtain numerical plots for the response rate $\dot{\mathcal{F}}$ of Unruh-de Witt detectors, which display non-trivial combined effects of rotation and curvature through the dimensionless parameter $\Lambda c^2/\Omega^2$. In particular, periodicity does not imply thermality due to additional poles in the Wightman function away from the imaginary axis. We then present some results for stationary rotational motion in arbitrary curved spacetime, as a perturbative expansion in curvature.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field using the spinor quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the adiabatic basis, the one-particle distribution function in momentum space is determined by utilizing the exact analytical solution of the Dirac equation. By examining the temporal behavior of the one-particle distribution function and the momentum spectrum of created pairs in the sub-critical field limit $(E_0 = 0.2E_c)$, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum(LMS) of particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the dynamical tunneling. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, which allows us to explain the origin and behavior of these oscillations. Additionally, we discuss the role of the vacuum polarization function and its counter term to the oscillations in LMS vacuum excitation. We also analyse the transverse momentum spectrum (TMS).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Clifford invariants of ADE Coxeter elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in novel Clifford geometric invariants of linear transformations. This motivates the investigation of such invariants for a certain type of geometric transformation of interest in the context of root systems, reflection groups, Lie groups and Lie algebras: the Coxeter transformations. We perform exhaustive calculations of all Coxeter transformations for $A_8$, $D_8$ and $E_8$ for a choice of basis of simple roots and compute their invariants, using high-performance computing. This computational algebra paradigm generates a dataset that can then be mined using techniques from data science such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. In this paper we focus on neural network classification and principal component analysis. Since the output -- the invariants -- is fully determined by the choice of simple roots and the permutation order of the corresponding reflections in the Coxeter element, we expect huge degeneracy in the mapping. This provides the perfect setup for machine learning, and indeed we see that the datasets can be machine learned to very high accuracy. This paper is a pump-priming study in experimental mathematics using Clifford algebras, showing that such Clifford algebraic datasets are amenable to machine learning, and shedding light on relationships between these novel and other well-known geometric invariants and also giving rise to analytic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological T-duality is a relationship between pairs (E, P ) over a fixed space X, where E over X is a principal torus bundle and P over E is a twist, such as a gerbe of principal PU(H)-bundle. This is of interest to topologists because of the T-duality transformation: a T-duality relation between pairs (E, P ) and (F, Q ) comes with an isomorphism (with degree shift) between the twisted K-theory of E and the twisted K-theory of F. We formulate topological T-duality in the equivariant setting, following the definition of Bunke, Rumpf, and Schick. We define the T-duality transformation in equivariant K-theory and show that it is an isomorphism for actions of compact Lie groups, equal to its own inverse and uniquely characterized by naturality and a normalization for trivial situations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave constraints on scalar-tensor gravity from a neutron star and black-hole binary GW200115</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonminimally coupled theories where a scalar field is coupled to the Ricci scalar, neutron stars (NSs) can have scalar charges through an interaction with matter mediated by gravity. On the other hand, the same theories do not give rise to hairy black hole (BH) solutions. The observations of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from an inspiralling NS-BH binary system allows a possibility of constraining the NS scalar charge. Moreover, the nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor theories generate a breathing scalar mode besides two tensor polarizations. Using the GW200115 data of the coalescence of a BH-NS binary, we place observational constraints on the NS scalar charge as well as the nonminimal coupling strength for a subclass of massless Horndeski theories with a luminal GW propagation. Unlike past related works, we exploit a waveform for a mixture of tensor and scalar polarizations. Taking the breathing mode into account, the scalar charge is more tightly constrained in comparison to the analysis of the tensor GWs alone. In nonminimally coupled theories including Brans-Dicke gravity and spontaneous scalarization scenarios with/without a kinetic screening, we put new bounds on model parameters of each theory.</description>

      <title>Bridging the $ \mu $Hz gap in the gravitational-wave landscape: unveiling dark baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves (GWs) with frequencies in the $\mu$Hz range, which arise from phase transitions related to dark confinement in the context of dark versions of Quantum Chromodynamics. Based on several compelling motivations, we posit that these theories predict the existence of GeV-mass asymmetric dark baryons, akin to ordinary baryons, with the potential to contribute to dark matter. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of a particular $\mathcal{O}(\text{TeV})$ scale for multiple reasons. First, to account for the similarity in present-day mass densities between dark matter and visible matter, various TeV-scale mechanisms can elucidate the similarities in both their number densities and masses. Moreover, to address the so-called electroweak hierarchy problem, we consider the introduction of either the Composite Higgs or Supersymmetry at around $\mathcal{O}(\text{TeV})$. These mechanisms lead to intriguing TeV collider signatures and the possibility of detecting mHz GWs in future experiments. In summary, this study provides a strong motivation for advancing GW experiments that can bridge the $\mu$Hz frequency gap in the GW spectrum. Additionally, there is a need for the construction of more powerful particle colliders to explore higher energy regimes. In consideration of the possibility to scrutinize these models from various perspectives, we strongly advocate their further development.</description>

Abstract: We consider antisymmetric Metric-Affine Theories of Gravity with a Lagrangian containing the most general terms up to dimension four and search for theories that are ghost- and tachyon-free when expanded around flat space. We find new examples that propagate only the graviton and one other massive degree of freedom of spin zero, one or two. These models require terms of the form $(\nabla T)^2$ in the Lagrangian, that have been largely ignored in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions are important probes for the behavior of quantum field theories. Already at tree-level, the Refined Gribov Zwanziger (RGZ) effective action for Yang-Mills theories provides a good approximation for the gluon propagator, as compared to that calculated by nonperturbative methods such as Lattice Field Theory and Dyson-Schwinger Equations. However, the study of higher correlation functions of the RGZ theory is still at its beginning. In this work we evaluate the ghost-antighost-gluon vertex function in Landau gauge at one-loop level, in $d=4$ space-time dimensions for the gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3). More precisely, we extend the analysis conducted in [1] for the soft-gluon limit to an arbitrary kinematic configuration. We introduce renormalization group effects by means of a toy model for the running coupling and investigate the impact of such a model in the ultraviolet tails of our results. We find that RGZ results match fairly closely those from lattice simulations, Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Curci-Ferrari model for three different kinematic configurations. This is compatible with RGZ being a feasible theory for the strong interaction in the infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Nucleons and vector mesons in a confining holographic QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple holographic QCD model that provides a unified description of vector mesons and nucleons in a confining background based on Einstein-dilaton gravity. For the confining background we consider analytical solutions of the Einstein-dilaton equations where the dilaton is a quadratic function of the radial coordinate far from the boundary. We build actions for the 5d gauge field and the 5d Dirac field dual to the 4d flavor current and the 4d nucleon interpolator respectively. In order to obtain asymptotically linear Regge trajectories we impose for each sector the condition that the effective Schr\"odinger equation has a potential that grows quadratically in the radial coordinate far from the boundary. For the vector mesons we show that this condition is automatically satisfied by a 5d Yang-Mills action minimally coupled to the metric and the dilaton. For the nucleons we find that the mass term of the 5d Dirac action needs to be generalised to include couplings to the metric and the dilaton. Using Sturm-Liouville theory we obtain a spectral decomposition for the hadronic correlators consistent with large $N_c$ QCD. Our setup contains only three parameters: the mass scale associated with confinement, the 5d gauge coupling and the 5d Dirac coupling. The last two are completely fixed by matching the correlators at high energies to perturbative QCD. We calculate masses and decay constants and compare our results against available experimental data. Our model can be thought of as a consistent embedding of soft wall models in Einstein-dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>Late-Time constraints on Interacting Dark Energy: Analysis independent of $H_0$, $r_d$ and $M_B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Yet another lattice formulation of 2D $U(1)$ chiral gauge theory via bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, lattice formulations of Abelian chiral gauge theory in two dimensions have been devised on the basis of the Abelian bosonization. A salient feature of these 2D lattice formulations is that the gauge invariance is \emph{exactly\/} preserved for anomaly-free theories and thus is completely free from the question of the gauge mode decoupling. In the present paper, we propose a yet another lattice formulation sharing this desired property. A particularly unique point in our formulation is that the vertex operator of the dual scalar field, which carries the vector charge of the fermion and the ``magnetic charge'' in the bosonization, is represented by a ``hole'' excised from the lattice; this is the excision method formulated recently by Abe et al. in a somewhat different context.</description>

      <title>Generic ETH: Eigenstate Thermalization beyond the Microcanonical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has played a key role in recent advances in the high energy and condensed matter communities. It explains how an isolated quantum system in a far-from-equilibrium initial state can evolve to a state that is indistinguishable from thermal equilibrium, with observables relaxing to almost time-independent results that can be described using traditional statistical mechanics ensembles. In this work we probe the limits of ETH, pushing it outside its prototypical applications in several directions. We design a qutrit lattice system with conserved quasilocal charge, in which we verify a form of generalized eigenstate thermalization. We also observe signatures of thermalization in states well outside microcanonical windows of both charge and energy, which we dub `generic ETH.'</description>

      <title>Computable conditions for order-2 $CP$ symmetry in NHDM potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects and light bosonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from black hole spacetimes of General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using black hole spacetimes of General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>
