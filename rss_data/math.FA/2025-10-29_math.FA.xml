      <title>On quantum large sieve inequalities and operator recovery from incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain large sieve type inequalities for the Rayleigh quotient of the restriction of phase space representations of higher rank operators, via an operator analogue of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The resulting bounds are referred to as `quantum large sieve inequalities'. On the shoulders of Donoho and Stark, we demonstrate that these inequalities guarantee the recovery of an operator whose phase-space information is missing or unobservable over a 'measure-sparse' region $\Omega $, by solving an $L^{1}$-minimization program in the complementary region $\Omega^{c}$, when the argument runs over an operator analogue of Feichtinger's algebra of integrable STFTs. This is an operator version of what is commonly known as `Logan's phenomenon'. Moreover, our results can be viewed as a deterministic, continuous variable version, on phase space, of `low-rank' matrix recovery, which itself can be regarded as an operator version of compressive sensing. Our results depend on an abstract large sieve principle for operators with integrable STFT and on a non-commutative analogue of the local reproducing formula in rotationally invariant domains (first stated by Seip for the Fock space of entire functions). As an application, we obtain concentration estimates for Cohen's class distributions and the Husimi function. We motivate the paper by comparing with Nicola and Tilli's Faber-Krahn inequality for the STFT, illustrating that norm bounds on a domain $\Omega $, obtained by large sieve methods, introduce a trade-off between sparsity and concentration properties of $\Omega $: If $\Omega $ is sparse, the large sieve bound may significantly improve known operator norm bounds, while if $\Omega $ is concentrated, it produces worse bounds.</description>

      <title>Some Plancherel identities for unbounded subsets of $\mathbb R$ in duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relation to Fuglede's conjecture, we establish several Plancherel-type identities and demonstrate the surjectivity of the Fourier transform between certain unbounded tiling sets of $\mathbb{R}$ that are in duality. In the terminology commonly used in the context of Fuglede's conjecture, our result states that an open set tiles $\mathbb{R}$ by the finite set $\{0,1,\dots,p-1\}$ if and only if it admits a spectrum (or, equivalently, a dual pair measure) given by the Lebesgue measure on $\left[-\tfrac{1}{2p}, \tfrac{1}{2p}\right] + \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Constrained dilation and $\Gamma$-contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A commuting pair of Hilbert space operators having the closed symmetrized bidisc \[ \Gamma=\{(z_1+z_2, z_1z_2) \in \mathbb C^2 \ : \ |z_1| \leq 1, |z_2| \leq 1\} \] as a spectral set is called a \textit{$\Gamma$-contraction}. A $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ is called \textit{$\Gamma$-distinguished} if $(S,P)$ is annihilated by a polynomial $q \in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ whose zero set $Z(q)$ defines a distinguished variety in the symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb G$. There is Schaffer-type minimal $\Gamma$-isometric dilation of a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ in the literature. In this article, we study when such a minimal $\Gamma$-isometric dilation is $\Gamma$-distinguished provided that $(S,P)$ is a $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contraction. We show that a pure $\Gamma$-isometry $(T,V)$ with defect space $\dim \mathcal D_{V^*}&lt; \infty$, is $\Gamma$-distinguished if and only if the fundamental operator of $(T^*,V^*)$ has numerical radius less than $1$. Further, it is proved that a $\Gamma$-contraction acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space dilates to a $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometry if its fundamental operator has numerical radius less than $1$. We also provide sufficient conditions for a pure $\Gamma$-contraction to be $\Gamma$-distinguished. Wold decomposition splits an isometry into two orthogonal parts of which one is a unitary and the other is a completely non-unitary contraction. In this direction, we find a few decomposition results for the $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-unitaries and $\Gamma$-distinguished pure $\Gamma$-isometries.</description>

      <title>Innovative Method for Proving Iterative Convergence of Strictly Nonexpansive Operators in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper makes substantial theoretical advancements in fixed point theory for strictly nonexpansive mappings. By developing an innovative proof technique, we successfully generalize the classical fixed-point theorem for strictly nonexpansive mappings originally established for compact sets to broader cases involving bounded sets. The key innovations lie in leveraging both the boundedness property of iterative sequences and the strict nonexpansiveness of mappings, which collectively enable us to significantly relax the conventional requirements of spatial convexity and compactness typically imposed on general nonexpansive mappings.</description>

      <title>Maximal non-compactness of embeddings between sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will focus on studying the ball measure of non-compactness $\alpha(T)$ for various particular instances of embedding operators in sequence spaces. Our first main goal is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for an identity operator to be maximally non-compact. Next, we will focus on studying Lorentz sequence spaces $\ell^{p,q}$ and their basic properties. We will characterize the inclusions between Lorentz sequence spaces depending on the values of $p$ and $q$. Then we will try to determine exact values of the norms of the identity operators between these embedded spaces. Lastly, we will determine whether these identity operators are maximally non-compact by using our general theorems.</description>

      <title>Coordinate systems and distributional embeddings in Bourgain-Rosenthal-Schechtman spaces: a framework for operator reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $1\leq \alpha&lt;\omega_1$, we construct an explicit unconditional finite-dimensional decomposition (FDD) $(X_\lambda)_{\lambda\in\mathcal{T}_\alpha}$ of the Bourgain-Rosenthal-Schechtman space $R_\alpha^{p,0}$ by blocking its standard martingale difference sequence (MDS) basis. This FDD has strong reproducing properties and supports a theory of distributional representations between the spaces $R_\alpha^{p,0}$, $1\leq \alpha&lt;\omega_1$. We use this framework to prove an approximate orthogonal reduction: every bounded linear operator on a limit space $R_\alpha^{p,0}$ is, via a distributional embedding and up to arbitrary precision, reduced to a scalar FDD-diagonal operator. As a consequence, the standard MDS bases of the limit spaces $R_\alpha^{p,0}$ satisfy the factorization property.</description>

      <title>Function Theory and necessary conditions for a Schwarz lemma related to $\mu$-Synthesis Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of $\mathbb{C}^7$ (respectively, of $\mathbb{C}^5$) associated with the structured singular value $\mu_E$, defined on $3 \times 3$ matrices, is denoted by $G_{E(3;3;1,1,1)}$ (respectively, by $G_{E(3;2;1,2)}$). In control engineering, the structured singular value $\mu_E$ plays a crucial role in analyzing the robustness and performance of linear feedback systems.
  We characterize the domain $G_{E(3;3;1,1,1)}$ and its closure $\Gamma_{E(3;3;1,1,1)}$, and employ realization formulas to describe both. The domain $G_{E(3;3;1,1,1)}$ and its closure are neither circular nor convex; however, they are simply connected. We provide an alternative proof of the polynomial and linear convexity of $\Gamma_{E(3;3;1,1,1)}$. Furthermore, we establish necessary conditions for a Schwarz lemma on the domains $G_{E(3;3;1,1,1)}$ and $G_{E(3;2;1,2)}$, and describe the relationships between these two domains as well as between their closed boundaries.</description>

      <title>Wiener-Pitt sets for compact Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $G$ is a compact Hausdorff Abelian group. We say $\mu \in M(G)$ is strongly continuous if $|\mu|(x+H)=0$ for any $x \in G$ and any $H \leq G$ that is closed and of infinite index.
  We prove that for any sufficiently rapidly decreasing sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}\in c_{0}(\mathbb{N})$, for every strongly continuous $\mu\in M(G)$ with $\|\mu\| \leq 1$ and $\widehat{\mu}(\widehat{G})\subset \{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\}\cup\{0\}$, the measure $\mu\ast\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Haar measure on $G$. This implies that $\mu$ does not exhibit the so-called Wiener-Pitt phenomenon.
  The paper is a continuation of investigations started in \cite{ow}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of finite-rank operators for an interpolation version of the Lieb--Thirring inequality in the mass--supercritical case, thereby extending a result of Hong, Kwon, and Yoon in 2019 to the full parameter regime. Our method also applies to the Hardy--Lieb--Thirring inequality, where the existence of optimizers faces additional difficulties due to the singularity of the inverse-square potential.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Geometric Deformations of Function Algebras on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for deforming the algebra of smooth functions on a compact Riemannian manifold based on spectral data rather than group actions or Poisson structures. The deformation is defined through spectral coefficients of the Laplacian and a weight function satisfying a fusion-type cocycle condition, producing a noncommutative product that depends intrinsically on Laplacian spectrum of the manifold. We develop the analytic and algebraic foundations of this construction, establishing associativity, continuity, and the existence of a group structure on admissible weights. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to spectrum-preserving maps of manifolds. This spectral-geometric deformation quantization approach provides a fully intrinsic analytic model of noncommutative geometry based solely on spectral data of the manifold.</description>

      <title>On the embeddings of selfadjoint operator spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate when a map on a selfadjoint operator space $E$ is an embedding, i.e., when its unitisation in the sense of Werner is completely isometric. Combining with results of Russell, of Ng, and of Dessi, the second and the last author, it is shown that this is equivalent to: (a) extending bounded positive functionals on each matrix level with the same norm; (b) extending quasistates to quasistates in each matrix level; (c) extending completely bounded completely positive maps with the same cb-norm; and (d) the map being a gauge maximal isometry in the sense of Russell. If $E$ is approximately positively generated and $\mathrm{C}^*(E)$ is unital, or if $E_{sa}$ is singly generated, then completely positive maps on $E\subseteq\mathcal{B}(H)$ have completely positive extensions on $\mathrm{C}^*(E)$, but possibly not with the same cb-norm; and this is not enough for the inclusion $E \subseteq \mathrm{C}^*(E)$ to be an embedding. We show that the inclusion $E \subseteq \mathrm{C}^*(E)$ is always an embedding when $E$ is completely approximately 1-generated, and we fully resolve the case when $E_{sa}$ is singly generated. Combining with the works of Salomon, Humeniuk--Kennedy--Manor, and previous work of the third author, we show that if the inclusion $E \subseteq \mathrm{C}^*(E)$ is an embedding, then rigidity at zero, in the sense of Salomon, coincides with $E$ being approximately positively generated. Consequently, we show that $E$ is approximately positively generated if and only if $M_n(E)$ is approximately positively generated for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$, thus extending a previous result of Humeniuk--Kennedy--Manor to the approximation setting. As an application we show that hyperrigidity of $E$ in $\mathrm{C}^*(E)$ allows to identify $\mathrm{C}^*(E)$ as the C*-envelope of $E$ in several (non-unital) contexts.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative BKW-Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the classical Bohman-Korovkin-Wulbert (BKW) operators, we initiate a study of noncommutative BKW-operators. Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra, and $S$ be a set of generators of $A$. A unital completely positive (UCP)-map $\phi: A\rightarrow B(H)$ is said to be a \textit{noncommutative BKW-operator} for $S$ with respect to norm or weak operator topology (WOT) or strong operator topology (SOT) if for any sequence of UCP-maps $\phi_n:A\rightarrow B(H)$, $n=1,2,...,$ $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\phi_n(s)=\phi(s),\forall ~s\in S$ in norm (or WOT or SOT) $\Rightarrow \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\phi_n(a)=\phi(a), \forall ~a\in A$ in norm (or WOT or SOT, respectively). We identify a connection between noncommutative BKW-operators and the unique CP-extension of UCP-maps. We have discussed several examples and explored different notions of noncommutative BKW-operators and their interconnections. Additionally, we introduce the concept of hyperrigidity with respect to a UCP-map and characterize it along the lines of Arveson. Although independent yet related to noncommutative BKW-operators, we provide a noncommutative version of operator version of the Korovkin theorem recently proposed by D. Popa.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Submodularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $t$-sum of squares (sos) submodularity, which is a hierarchy, indexed by $t$, of sufficient algebraic conditions for certifying submodularity of set functions. We show that, for fixed $t$, each level of the hierarchy can be verified via a semidefinite program of size polynomial in $n$, the size of the ground set of the set function. This is particularly relevant given existing hardness results around testing whether a set function is submodular (Crama, 1989). We derive several equivalent algebraic characterizations of $t$-sos submodularity and identify submodularity-preserving operations that also preserve $t$-sos submodularity. We further present a complete classification of the cases for which submodularity and $t$-sos submodularity coincide, as well as examples of $t$-sos-submodular functions. We demonstrate the usefulness of $t$-sos submodularity through three applications: (i) a new convex approach to submodular regression, involving minimal manual tuning; (ii) a systematic procedure to derive lower bounds on the submodularity ratio in approximate submodular maximization, and (iii) improved difference-of-submodular decompositions for difference-of-submodular optimization. Overall, our work builds a new bridge between discrete optimization and real algebraic geometry by connecting sum of squares-based algebraic certificates to a fundamental discrete structure, submodularity.</description>

Abstract: Under mild assumptions, we prove that reduced free products and reduced graph products of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras are selfless in the sense of L. Robert, without assuming the rapid decay property. In particular, our main theorems yield numerous new examples of simple, monotracial $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras with strict comparison, stable rank one, and admitting a unique unital embedding of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We study, for a continuous linear operator $T$ on an F-space $X$, when the direct sum operator $T\oplus T$ is recurrent on $X\oplus X$. In particular: we establish, for recurrence, the analogous notion to that of (topological) weak-mixing for transitivity/hypercyclicity, namely quasi-rigidity; and we construct a recurrent but not quasi-rigid operator on each infinite-dimensional Banach space, solving the $T\oplus T$-recurrence problem in the negative way. The quasi-rigidity notion is closely related to the dense lineability of the set of recurrent vectors, and using similar conditions we study the lineability and dense lineability properties for the set of $\mathcal{F}$-recurrent vectors.

      <title>On F-semi-transitive families of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the concept of disjoint topological transitivity for supercyclicity, in this paper, we introduce the concept of disjoint Furstenberg-semi-transitivity. Then we provide sufficient conditions for cosine operator functions generated by adjoints of weighted composition operators to be Furstenberg-semi-transitive on the space of Radon measures on a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space. Also, we characterize disjoint Furstenberg-semi-transitive generalized bilateral weighted shifts on the standard Hilbert module over the C*-algebra of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space. As a special case, we consider the case when the corresponding Furstenberg family under consideration is the family of all infinite subsets of the set of natural numbers. Finally, we illustrate our results with concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Stability results of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property and the generalized AHSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for operators (BPBp for short). To this end, we investigate the generalized approximate hyperplane series property (generalized AHSP for short) for a pair $(X,Y)$ of Banach spaces, which characterizes when $(\ell_1(X),Y)$ has the BPBp. We prove the following results. For $L$ a locally compact Hausdorff space and $\mathcal{A}$ a unital uniform algebra, if either $(X, \mathcal{C}_0(L,Y))$ or $(X, \mathcal{A}^Y)$ has the BPBp, then so does $(X,Y)$. Furthermore, if $X$ is finite-dimensional and the pair $(X, Y)$ has the generalized AHSP, then the pair $(X, Z)$ also has the generalized AHSP, where $Z$ is one of the spaces $\mathcal{C}(K, Y)$, $\mathcal{C}_0(L, Y)$, $\mathcal{C}_b(\Omega, Y)$, or $\mathcal{A}^Y$, with $K$ a compact Hausdorff space, $\Omega$ a completely regular space, and $\mathcal{A}$ a uniform algebra.</description>

      <title>On the conjugate weight function and ultradifferentiable classes of entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the new notion of a conjugate weight function and provide a detailed study of this operation and its properties. Then we apply this knowledge to study classes of ultradifferentiable functions defined in terms of fast growing weight functions in the sense of Braun-Meise-Taylor and hence violating standard regularity requirements. Therefore, we transfer recent results shown by the author and D.N. Nenning from the weight sequence to the weight function framework. In order to proceed and to complete the picture we also define the conjugate associated weight matrix and investigate the relation to conjugate weight sequences via the corresponding associate weight functions. Finally, as it has already been done in the weight sequence case, we generalize results by M. Markin from the small Gevrey-setting and show how the corresponding non-standard ultradifferentiable function classes can be used to detect boundedness of normal linear operators on Hilbert spaces (associated with an evolution equation problem). On the one hand, when involving the weight matrix here the crucial information concerning regularity of the weak solutions can be expressed in terms of only one weight, namely of the given weight function. But, on the other hand, for the connection to the weighted entire setting the required conditions on the weight function are too restrictive in the general case.</description>

      <title>Learning Firmly Nonexpansive Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven approach for constructing firmly nonexpansive operators. We demonstrate its applicability in Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods, where classical algorithms such as Forward-Backward splitting, Chambolle-Pock primal-dual iteration, Douglas-Rachford iteration or alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM), are modified by replacing one proximal map by a learned firmly nonexpansive operator. We provide sound mathematical background to the problem of learning such an operator via expected and empirical risk minimization. We prove that, as the number of training points increases, the empirical risk minimization problem converges (in the sense of Gamma-convergence) to the expected risk minimization problem. Further, we derive a solution strategy that ensures firmly nonexpansive and piecewise affine operators within the convex envelope of the training set. We show that this operator converges to the best empirical solution as the number of points in the envelope increases in an appropriate way. Finally, the experimental section details practical implementations of the method and presents an application in image denoising, where we consider a novel, interpretable PnP Chambolle-Pock primal-dual iteration.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of quasi-convex functionals with variable exponent growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a relaxation result for a quasi-convex bulk integral functional with variable exponent growth in a suitable space of bounded variation type. A key tool is a decomposition under mild assumptions of the energy into absolutely continuous and singular parts weighted via a recession function.</description>
