      <title>On the variety generated by all semirings of order two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are ten distinct two-element semirings up to isomorphism, denoted \( L_2, R_2, M_2, D_2, N_2, T_2, Z_2, W_2, Z_7 \), and \( Z_8 \) (see \cite{bk}). Among these, the multiplicative reductions of \( M_2, D_2, W_2 \), and \( Z_8 \) form semilattices, while the additive reductions of \( L_2, R_2, M_2, D_2, N_2 \), and \( T_2 \) are idempotent semilattices, commonly referred to as \emph{idempotent semirings}. In 2015, Vechtomov and Petrov \cite{vp} studied the variety generated by \( M_2, D_2, W_2 \), and \( Z_8 \), proving that it is finitely based. In the same year, Shao and Ren \cite{srii} examined the variety generated by the six idempotent semirings, demonstrating that every subvariety of this variety is finitely based.
  This paper systematically investigates the variety generated by all ten two-element semirings. We prove that this variety contains exactly 480 subvarieties, each of which is finitely based.</description>

      <title>Open multiplication in relatively free profinite semigroupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to extend some useful results, such as the multiplication being open, previously known for suitable finitely generated relatively free profinite semigroups, to relatively free profinite semigroupoids over finite-vertex graphs. This extension is used to give a profinite characterization of recurrent words over infinite alphabets and to establish new results about stabilizers in relatively free profinite semigroups and semigroupoids.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic spaces not quasi-isometric to curve complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a condition that prevents a hyperbolic space from being quasi-isometric to the curve complex of any non-sporadic surface. Our result applies to several hyperbolic complexes, including arc complexes, disk complexes, non-separating curve complexes, (hyperbolic) pants complexes, and to free splitting complexes of free groups.</description>

      <title>Partial character tables for $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-spetses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathbb{G}}$ be a simply connected ${\mathbb{Z}}_\ell$-spets, let $q$ be a prime power, prime to $\ell$ and let $S$ be the underlying Sylow $\ell$-subgroup. Firstly, motivated by known formulae for values of Deligne-Lusztig characters of finite reductive groups, we propose a formula for the values of the unipotent characters of ${\mathbb{G}}(q)$ on the elements of $S$. Using this, we explicitly list the unipotent character values of the ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$-spets $G_{24}(q)$ related to the Benson-Solomon fusion system Sol$(q)$.
  Secondly, when $\ell &gt; 2$ is a very good prime for ${\mathbb{G}}$, the Weyl group $W$ of ${\mathbb{G}}$ has order coprime with $\ell$, and $q\equiv1\pmod\ell$ we introduce a formula for the values of characters in the principal block of ${\mathbb{G}}(q)$ which extends the Curtis-Schewe type formulae for groups of Lie type, and which we show to satisfy a version of block orthogonality.
  In both cases we formulate and provide evidence for several conjectures concerning the proposed values.</description>

      <title>Locally elliptic actions, torsion groups, and nonpositively curved spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending and unifying a number of well-known conjectures and open questions, we conjecture that locally elliptic (that is, every element has a bounded orbit) actions by automorphisms of finitely generated groups on finite dimensional nonpositively curved complexes have global fixed points. In particular, finitely generated torsion groups cannot act without fixed points on such spaces. We prove these conjectures for a wide class of complexes, including all infinite families of Euclidean buildings, Helly complexes, some graphical small cancellation and systolic complexes, uniformly locally finite Gromov hyperbolic graphs. We present consequences of these result, e.g. concerning the automatic continuity.
  Our main tool are Helly graphs. On the way we prove several results concerning their automorphisms. We present and study a new notion of geodesic clique paths. Their local-to-global properties are crucial in our proof of ellipticity results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tits alternative for groups of almost automorphisms of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a dynamical variant of the Tits alternative for the group of almost automorphisms of a locally finite tree $\mathcal{T}$: a group of almost automorphisms of $\mathcal{T}$ either contains a nonabelian free group playing ping-pong on the boundary $\partial \mathcal{T}$, or the action of the group on $\partial \mathcal{T}$ preserves a probability measure. This generalises to all groups of tree almost automorphisms a result of S. Hurtado and E. Militon for Thompson's group $V$, with a hopefully simpler proof.</description>

      <title>A link condition for simplicial complexes, and CUB spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We motivate the study of metric spaces with a unique convex geodesic bicombing, which we call CUB spaces. These encompass many classical notions of nonpositive curvature, such as CAT(0) spaces and Busemann-convex spaces. Groups having a geometric action on a CUB space enjoy numerous properties.
  We want to know when a simplicial complex, endowed with a natural polyhedral metric, is CUB. We establish a link condition, stating essentially that the complex is locally a lattice. This generalizes Gromov's link condition for cube complexes, for the $\ell^\infty$ metric.
  The link condition applies to numerous examples, including Euclidean buildings, simplices of groups, Artin complexes of Euclidean Artin groups, (weak) Garside groups, some arcs and curve complexes, and minimal spanning surfaces of knots.</description>

      <title>Complementation in Continuous Cohomology with Coefficients in Banach Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the concept of weakly uniquely stationary representations. This framework enables us to investigate the complementability of closed subspaces within the context of continuous cohomology with coeffcients in Banach modules. As an application, we extend and refine several cohomological results from the literature, particularly in the settings of nilpotent groups, products of groups, and lattices.</description>

      <title>Natural extensions of embeddable semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semigroup actions and their invertible extensions are discussed. First, we develop a theory of natural extensions for continuous actions of countable, embeddable semigroups. Second, we demonstrate that not every surjective such action of a semigroup, which embeds into a group and generates it, can be extended to an action of said group, and that this phenomenon is specific to non-reversible semigroups. Furthermore, we characterize the free group on a semigroup (the group together with the embedding) as the unique pair that always admits such an extension, showing that both the choice of the receiving group and the embedding are crucial for this construction. Next, we prove that the classical notion of a natural extension -- requiring all other invertible extensions to factor through it -- only works in the context of compact extensions of left reversible semigroup actions and fails outside of it, thus providing a characterization of left reversibility. We finish by briefly studying topological dynamical properties of the natural extension in the amenable case.</description>
