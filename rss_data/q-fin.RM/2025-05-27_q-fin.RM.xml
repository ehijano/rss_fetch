      <title>A General Theory of Risk Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for risk sharing that generalizes earlier models based on discrete agents and extends them to allow for sharing risk within a continuum of agents. Agents are represented by points of a measure space and have potentially heterogeneous risk preferences modeled by risk measures. The existence of risk minimizing allocations is proved when constrained to satisfy economically convincing conditions. In the unconstrained case, we derive the dual representation of the value function using a Strassen-type theorem for the weak-star topology. These results are illustrated by explicit formulas when risk preferences are within the family of entropic and expected shortfall risk measures.</description>

      <title>Particle Systems with Local Interactions via Hitting Times and Cascades on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle systems interacting via hitting times on sparsely connected graphs, following the framework of Lacker, Ramanan and Wu (2023). We provide general robustness conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of physical solutions to the dynamics, and demonstrate their connections to the dynamic percolation theory. We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.</description>

      <title>Marginal Fairness: Fair Decision-Making under Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces marginal fairness, a new individual fairness notion for equitable decision-making in the presence of protected attributes such as gender, race, and religion. This criterion ensures that decisions based on generalized distortion risk measures are insensitive to distributional perturbations in protected attributes, regardless of whether these attributes are continuous, discrete, categorical, univariate, or multivariate. To operationalize this notion and reflect real-world regulatory environments (such as the EU gender-neutral pricing regulation), we model business decision-making in highly regulated industries (such as insurance and finance) as a two-step process: (i) a predictive modeling stage, in which a prediction function for the target variable (e.g., insurance losses) is estimated based on both protected and non-protected covariates; and (ii) a decision-making stage, in which a generalized distortion risk measure is applied to the target variable, conditional only on non-protected covariates, to determine the decision. In this second step, we modify the risk measure such that the decision becomes insensitive to the protected attribute, thus enforcing fairness to ensure equitable outcomes under risk-sensitive, regulatory constraints. Furthermore, by utilizing the concept of cascade sensitivity, we extend the marginal fairness framework to capture how dependencies between covariates propagate the influence of protected attributes through the modeling pipeline. A numerical study and an empirical implementation using an auto insurance dataset demonstrate how the framework can be applied in practice.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating binary probabilistic classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recalibration of binary probabilistic classifiers to a target prior probability is an important task in areas like credit risk management. We analyse methods for recalibration from a distribution shift perspective. Distribution shift assumptions linked to the area under the curve (AUC) of a probabilistic classifier are found to be useful for the design of meaningful recalibration methods. Two new methods called parametric covariate shift with posterior drift (CSPD) and ROC-based quasi moment matching (QMM) are proposed and tested together with some other methods in an example setting. The outcomes of the test suggest that the QMM methods discussed in the paper can provide appropriately conservative results in evaluations with concave functionals like for instance risk weights functions for credit risk.</description>

      <title>Perpetual Demand Lending Pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized perpetuals protocols have collectively reached billions of dollars of daily trading volume, yet are still not serious competitors on the basis of trading volume with centralized venues such as Binance. One of the main reasons for this is the high cost of capital for market makers and sophisticated traders in decentralized settings. Recently, numerous decentralized finance protocols have been used to improve borrowing costs for perpetual futures traders. We formalize this class of mechanisms utilized by protocols such as Jupiter, Hyperliquid, and GMX, which we term~\emph{Perpetual Demand Lending Pools} (PDLPs). We then formalize a general target weight mechanism that generalizes what GMX and Jupiter are using in practice. We explicitly describe pool arbitrage and expected payoffs for arbitrageurs and liquidity providers within these mechanisms. Using this framework, we show that under general conditions, PDLPs are easy to delta hedge, partially explaining the proliferation of live hedged PDLP strategies. Our results suggest directions to improve capital efficiency in PDLPs via dynamic parametrization.</description>
