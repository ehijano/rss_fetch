      <title>Nested Sequents for Intuitionistic Multi-Modal Logics: Cut-Elimination and Lyndon Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study single-conclusioned nested sequent calculi for a broad class of intuitionistic multi-modal logics known as intuitionistic grammar logics (IGLs). These logics serve as the intuitionistic counterparts of classical grammar logics, and subsume standard intuitionistic modal and tense logics, including IK and IKt extended with combinations of the T, B, 4, 5, and D axioms. We analyze fundamental invertibility and admissibility properties of our calculi and introduce a novel structural rule, called the shift rule, which unifies standard structural rules arising from modal frame conditions into a single rule. This rule enables a purely syntactic proof of cut-admissibility that is uniform over all IGLs, and yields completeness of our nested calculi as a corollary. Finally, we define an interpolation algorithm that operates over single-conclusioned nested sequent proofs. This gives constructive proofs of both the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP) and Beth definability property (BDP) for all IGLs and for all intuitionistic modal and tense logics they subsume. To the best of the author's knowledge, this style of interpolation algorithm (that acts on single-conclusioned nested sequent proofs) and the resulting LIP and BDP results are new.</description>

      <title>Hyperintensional Intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intentions are crucial for our practical reasoning. The rational intention obeys some simple logical principles, such as agglomeration and consistency, among others, motivating the search for a proper logic of intention. However, such a logic should be weak enough not to force the closure under entailment; otherwise, we cannot distinguish between intended consequences of agents' choices and their unintended side-effects.  In this paper we argue that we should avoid not only the closure under entailment, but the weaker closure under equivalence as well. To achieve this, we develop a hyperintensional logic of intention, where what an agent intends is constrained by the agent's decision problem. The proposed system combines some elements of inquisitive and topic-sensitive theories of  intensional modals. Along the way, we also show that the existing closest relatives of our framework overgenerate validities by validating some instances of closure under equivalence. Finally, we provide a sound and strongly complete axiomatization for this logic.</description>

      <title>Distributed Knowing How</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed knowledge is a key concept in the standard epistemic logic of knowledge-that. In this paper, we propose a corresponding notion of distributed knowledge-how and study its logic. Our framework generalizes two existing traditions in the logic of know-how: the individual-based multi-step framework and the coalition-based single-step framework. In particular, we assume a group can accomplish more than what its individuals can jointly do. The distributed knowledge-how is based on the distributed knowledge-that of a group whose multi-step strategies derive from distributed actions that subgroups can collectively perform. As the main result, we obtain a sound and strongly complete proof system for our logic of distributed knowledge-how, which closely resembles the logic of distributed knowledge-that in both the axioms and the proof method of completeness.</description>

      <title>Conditionals Based on Selection Functions, Modal Operators and Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for probability updating, of which Bayesian conditionalization is the most well-known and widely used, are modeling tools that aim to represent the process of modifying an initial epistemic state, typically represented by a prior probability function P, which is adjusted in light of new information. Notably, updating methods and conditional sentences seem to intuitively share a deep connection, as is evident in the case of conditionalization. The present work contributes to this line of research and aims at shedding new light on the relationship between updating methods and conditional connectives. Departing from previous literature that often focused on a specific type of conditional or a particular updating method, our goal is to prove general results concerning the connection between conditionals and their probabilities. This will allow us to characterize the probabilities of certain conditional connectives and to understand what class of updating procedures can be represented using specific conditional connectives. Broadly, we adopt a general perspective that encompasses a large class of conditionals and a wide range of updating methods, enabling us to prove some general results concerning their interrelation.</description>

      <title>Group Knowledge of Hypothetical Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, epistemic logics have been extended with operators K_ax for knowledge of (the value of) a variable x (by an agent a). We study dynamic versions of these logics, enriched with modalities for semi-public data-exchange events (e.g., public announcements, data-sharing within a subgroup, or changing the value of a variable). To obtain a complete axiomatization of data-exchange events, in the presence of equality x = y and K_ax, one needs to extend the logic further: first, with an operator for distributed knowledge K_Ax of the value (by a group of agents A); next, with a conditional version of this: distributed knowledge K^P_A x (of the value by a group) given some hypothetical condition (expressed by some proposition P); then, with definite descriptions x^P_A , denoting the 'hypothetical' value of x according to A's (distributed) knowledge given condition P. In order to deal with common knowledge in the presence of semi-public data exchanges, we also need to add a novel conditional version of the recent concept of common distributed knowledge. We investigate the resulting logic, giving examples and presenting a complete axiomatization and a decidability proof.</description>

      <title>Graded Distributed Belief</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new logic of graded distributed belief that allows us to express the fact that a group of agents distributively believe that a certain fact holds with at least strength k. We interpret our logic by means of computationally grounded semantics relying on the concept of belief base. The strength of the group's distributed belief is directly computed from the group's belief base after having merged its members' individual belief bases. We illustrate our logic with an intuitive example, formalizing the notion of epistemic disagreement. We also provide a sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatization, decidability result obtained via filtration, and a tableaux-based decision procedure that allows us to state PSPACE-completeness for our logic.</description>

      <title>Comparing State-Representations for DEL Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model checking with the standard Kripke models used in (Dynamic) Epistemic Logic leads to scalability issues. Hence alternative representations have been developed, in particular symbolic structures based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and succinct models based on mental programs. While symbolic structures have been shown to perform well in practice, their theoretical complexity was not known so far. On the other hand, for succinct models model checking is known to be PSPACE-complete, but no implementations are available.
  We close this gap and directly relate the two representations. We show that model checking DEL on symbolic structures encoded with BDDs is also PSPACE-complete. In fact, already model checking Epistemic Logic without dynamics is PSPACE-complete on symbolic structures. We also provide direct translations between BDDs and mental programs. Both translations yield exponential outputs. For the translation from mental programs to BDDs we show that no small translation exists. For the other direction we conjecture the same.

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize epistemic logic so that it can help reason about ways of combining common knowledge and distributed knowledge such as "common distributed knowledge", "distributed common knowledge", "distributed common distributed knowledge" and so on. Moreover, we study the logic of its dynamic update by arbitrary reading events. We axiomatize these logics and prove their soundness and completeness.</description>

      <title>Are Large Random Graphs Always Safe to Hide?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss winning possibilities of players in various variants of cops and robber game played on large random graphs, a testbed for various kinds of network queries, search problems in particular. We explore the use of logic frameworks to investigate such results; in particular, we show that whenever a winning condition for either player can be expressed as a certain kind of formula in first-order logic, that player almost always wins. In the process, we obtain more insight into the logic-game connection from the zero-one law perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal probabilistic logics provide a framework for reasoning about probability in modal contexts, involving notions such as knowledge, belief, time, and action. In this paper, we study a particular family of these logics, extending the modal {\L}ukasiewicz many-valued logic. These logics are shown to be capable of expressing nuanced probabilistic concepts, including upper and lower probabilities. Our main contribution is a PSPACE-completeness result for two variants of the local consequence problem, providing a precise computational characterisation.</description>

      <title>Modal Logic for Simulation, Refinement, and Mutual Ignorance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation and refinement are variations of the bisimulation relation, where in the former we keep only atoms and forth, and in the latter only atoms and back. Quantifying over simulations and refinements captures the effects of information change in a multi-agent system. In the case of quantification over refinements, we are looking at all the ways the agents in a system can become more informed. Similarly, in the case of quantification over simulations, we are dealing with all the ways the agents can become less informed, or in other words, could have been less informed, as we are at liberty how to interpret time in dynamic epistemic logic. While quantification over refinements has been well explored in the literature, quantification over simulations has received considerably less attention. In this paper, we explore the relationship between refinements and simulations. To this end, we also employ the notion of mutual factual ignorance that allows us to capture the state of a model before agents have learnt any factual information. In particular, we consider the extensions of multi-modal logic with the simulation and refinement modalities, as well as modalities for mutual factual ignorance. We provide reduction-based axiomatizations for several of the resulting logics that are built extending one another in a modular fashion.</description>

      <title>Impure Simplicial Complex and Term-Modal Logic with Assignment Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impure simplicial complexes are a powerful tool to model multi-agent epistemic situations where agents may die, but it is difficult to define a satisfactory semantics for the ordinary propositional modal language on such models, since many conceptually dubious expressions involving dead agents can be expressed in this language. In this paper, we introduce a term-modal language with assignment operators, in which such conceptually dubious expressions are syntactically excluded. We define both simplicial semantics and first-order Kripke semantics for this language, characterize their respective expressivity through notions of bisimulation, and show that the two semantics are equivalent when we consider a special class of first order Kripke models called local epistemic models. We also offer a complete axiomatization for the epistemic logic based on this language, and show that our language has a notion of assignment normal form. Finally, we discuss the behavior of a kind of intensional distributed knowledge that can be naturally expressed in our language.</description>

Abstract: In the 2013 Advent calender of the Berlin Mathematics Research Center MATH+, Gerhard Woeginger presents a novel hat problem with an uncommon initial announcement. Although the information given is insufficient for the hat bearers to learn their colour, they are informed that the colours have been chosen so that they can learn their colour. We formalize this announcement in public announcement logic and in an extension of public announcement logic with fixpoints.</description>

      <title>A programming language combining quantum and classical control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two main notions of control in quantum programming languages are often referred to as "quantum" control and "classical" control. With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information, potentially resulting from a quantum measurement, and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed state quantum computation. Whereas with quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the "control" is based on superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients for achieving this are: (1) syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed state quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of "quantum configuration" from quantum lambda-calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces, for pure computation and von Neumann algebras, for mixed state computation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: This technical report presents a comprehensive formal verification approach for probabilistic agent systems modeling ballistic rocket flight trajectories using Probabilistic Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (PATL). We describe an innovative verification framework specifically designed for analyzing critical safety properties of ballistic rockets engineered to achieve microgravity conditions for scientific experimentation. Our model integrates authentic flight telemetry data encompassing velocity vectors, pitch angles, attitude parameters, and GPS coordinates to construct probabilistic state transition systems that rigorously account for environmental stochasticity, particularly meteorological variability. We formalize mission-critical safety properties through PATL specifications to systematically identify trajectory deviation states where the rocket risks landing in prohibited or hazardous zones. The verification framework facilitates real-time safety monitoring and enables automated intervention mechanisms, including emergency engine disengagement protocols, when predefined safety thresholds are exceeded. Experimental validation demonstrates the practical effectiveness and reliability of our approach in ensuring mission safety while maintaining scientific mission objectives.</description>

      <title>Denotational semantics for stabiliser quantum programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabiliser fragment of quantum theory is a foundational building block for quantum error correction and the fault-tolerant compilation of quantum programs. In this article, we develop a sound, universal and complete denotational semantics for stabiliser operations which include measurement, classically-controlled Pauli operators, and affine classical operations, in which quantum error-correcting codes are first-class objects. The operations are interpreted as certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a conceptually motivated and computationally-tractable alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as the state space increases in size). We demonstrate the power of the resulting semantics by describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational semantics.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Constrained Optimization for Cloud Application Deployment via Graph Neural Networks and Satisfiability Modulo Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid neuro-symbolic framework for the optimal and scalable deployment of component-based applications in the Cloud. The challenge of efficiently mapping application components to virtual machines (VMs) across diverse VM Offers from Cloud Providers is formalized as a constrained optimization problem (COP), considering both general and application-specific constraints. Due to the NP-hard nature and scalability limitations of exact solvers, we introduce a machine learning-enhanced approach where graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on small-scale deployment instances and their predictions are used as soft constraints within the Z3 SMT solver. The deployment problem is recast as a graph edge classification task over a heterogeneous graph, combining relational embeddings with constraint reasoning. Our framework is validated through several realistic case studies, each highlighting different constraint profiles. Experimental results confirm that incorporating GNN predictions improves solver scalability and often preserves or even improves cost-optimality. This work demonstrates the practical benefits of neuro-symbolic coupling for Cloud infrastructure planning and contributes a reusable methodology for general NP-hard problems.</description>

      <title>Common $p$-Belief with Plausibility Measures: Extended Abstract</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aumann's famous Agreeing to Disagree Theorem states that if a group of agents share a common prior, update their beliefs by Bayesian conditioning based on private information, and have common knowledge of their posterior beliefs regarding some event, these posteriors must be identical. There is an elegant generalization of this theorem by Monderer and Samet, later refined by Neeman: if a group of agents share a common prior, update their beliefs using Bayesian conditioning on private information, and have common p-belief of their posteriors, these posteriors must be close (i.e., they cannot differ by more than 1 - p). Here, common p-belief generalizes the concept of common knowledge to probabilistic beliefs: agents commonly p-believe an event E if everyone believes E to at least degree p, everyone believes to at least degree p that everyone believes E to at least degree p, and so on.
  This paper further extends the Monderer-Samet-Neeman Agreement Theorem from classical probability measures to plausibility measures -- a very general framework introduced by Halpern that unifies many formal models of belief. To facilitate this extension, we provide a new proof of the Monderer-Samet-Neeman theorem in the classical setting. Building upon both the original proof and our new proof, we offer two different generalizations of the theorem to plausibility-based structures.
  We then apply these generalized results to several non-classical belief models, including conditional probability structures and lexicographic probability structures. Moreover, we show that whenever our generalized theorems do not apply, the Monderer-Samet-Neeman Agreement Theorem fails. These findings suggest that our results successfully identify the minimal conditions required for a belief model to satisfy the Monderer-Samet-Neeman Agreement Theorem.

      <title>On the Complexity of the Grounded Semantics for Infinite Argumentation Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.</description>

      <title>Who is Afraid of Minimal Revision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel logic-based concept called Space Explanations for classifying neural networks that gives provable guarantees of the behavior of the network in continuous areas of the input feature space. To automatically generate space explanations, we leverage a range of flexible Craig interpolation algorithms and unsatisfiable core generation. Based on real-life case studies, ranging from small to medium to large size, we demonstrate that the generated explanations are more meaningful than those computed by state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Gerver-Ramsey collinearity problem of determining the maximum number of points in a north-east lattice path without $k$ collinear points. Using a satisfiability solver, up to isomorphism we enumerate all north-east lattice paths avoiding $k$ collinear points for $k \leq 6$. We also find a north-east lattice path avoiding $k = 7$ collinear points with 327 steps, improving on the previous best length of 260 steps found by Shallit.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum polymorphisms to the complexity theory of non-local games. We use this notion to give a full characterisation of the existence of commutativity gadgets for relational structures, introduced by Ji as a method for achieving quantum soundness of classical CSP reductions. Prior to our work, a classification was only known in the Boolean case [Culf--Mastel, STOC'25]. As an application of our framework, we prove that the entangled CSP parameterised by odd cycles is undecidable. Furthermore, we establish a quantum version of Galois connection for entangled CSPs in the case of non-oracular quantum homomorphisms.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general framework to allow: (a) specifying the operational semantics of a programming language; and (b) stating and proving properties about program correctness. Our framework is based on a many-sorted system of hybrid modal logic, for which we prove completeness results. We believe that our approach to program verification improves over the existing approaches within modal logic as (1) it is based on operational semantics which allows for a more natural description of the execution than Hoare's style weakest precondition used by dynamic logic; (2) being multi-sorted, it allows for a clearer encoding of semantics, with a smaller representational distance to its intended meaning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hoare-style inference rules for program constructs permit the copying of expressions and tests from program text into logical contexts. It is known that this requires care even for sequential programs but much more serious issues arise with concurrent programs because of potential interference to the values of variables. The "rely-guarantee" approach tackles the challenge of recording acceptable interference and offers a way to provide safe inference rules for concurrent constructs. This paper shows how the algebraic presentation of rely-guarantee ideas can clarify and formalise the conditions for safely re-using expressions and tests from program text in logical contexts for reasoning about concurrent programs; crucially this extends to handling expressions that reference more than one shared variable. A non-trivial example related to the Fischer-Galler forest representation of equivalence relations is treated.</description>

      <title>On the Logical Content of Knowledge Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard epistemic logics introduce a modal operator K to represent knowledge, but in doing so they presuppose the logical apparatus they aim to explain. By contrast, this paper explores how logic may be derived from the structure of knowledge itself. We begin from a pre-logical notion of a knowledge base understood as a network of inferential connections between atomic propositions. Logical constants are then defined in terms of what is supported by such a base: intrinsically, by relations that hold within it, and extrinsically, by the behaviour of those relations under extension. This yields a general semantic framework in which familiar systems (classical, intuitionistic, and various intermediate logics) arise naturally from different assumptions about the form of knowledge. This offers a reversal of the traditional explanatory order: rather than treating logic as a precondition for the articulation of knowledge, it shows how logical structure can emerge from epistemic organisation.</description>

Abstract: The languages of mathematical physics and modelling are endowed with a rich ``grammar of dimensions'' that common abstractions of programming languages fail to represent. We propose a dependently typed domain-specific language (embedded in Idris) that captures this grammar. We apply it to explain basic notions of dimensional analysis and Buckingham's Pi theorem. We hope that the language makes mathematical physics more accessible to computer scientists and functional programming more palatable to modellers and physicists.</description>

      <title>A type-theoretic definition of lax $(\infty,\infty)$-limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a purely syntactic notion of lax cones and $(\infty,\infty)$-limits on finite computads in \texttt{CaTT}, a type theory for $(\infty,\infty)$-categories due to Finster and Mimram. Conveniently, finite computads are precisely the contexts in \texttt{CaTT}. We define a cone over a context to be a context, which is obtained by induction over the list of variables of the underlying context. In the case where the underlying context is globular we give an explicit description of the cone and conjecture that an analogous description continues to hold also for general contexts. We use the cone to control the types of the term constructors for the universal cone. The implementation of the universal property follows a similar line of ideas. Starting with a cone as a context, a set of context extension rules produce a context with the shape of a transfor between cones, i.e.~a higher morphism between cones. As in the case of cones, we use this context as a template to control the types of the term constructor required for universal property.</description>

      <title>Modal Logic for Reasoning About Uncertainty and Confusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a modal logic that can formalise statements about uncertainty and beliefs such as `I think that my wallet is in the drawer rather than elsewhere' or `I am confused whether my appointment is on Monday or Tuesday'. To do that, we expand G\"odel modal logic KG with the involutive negation ~ defined as v(~A,w)=1-v(A,w). We provide semantics with the finite model property for our new logic that we call KG_inv and show its equivalence to the standard semantics over [0,1]-valued Kripke models. Namely, we show that a formula is valid in the standard semantics of KG_inv iff it is valid in the new semantics. Using this new semantics, we construct a constraint tableaux calculus for KG_inv that allows for an explicit extraction of countermodels from complete open branches and then employ the tableaux calculus to obtain the PSPACE-completeness of the validity in KG_inv.</description>

      <title>RvLLM: LLM Runtime Verification with Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18585</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>A Logic for Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.</description>
