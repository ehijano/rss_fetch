      <title>Advancing Financial Engineering with Foundation Models: Progress, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models (FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related publications and resources will be maintained on our website https://github.com/FinFM/Awesome-FinFMs.</description>

      <title>Alternative Loss Function in Evaluation of Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper design and architecture of testing machine learning models, especially in their application to quantitative finance problems, is crucial. The most important aspect of this process is selecting an adequate loss function for training, validation, estimation purposes, and hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, in this research, through empirical experiments on equity and cryptocurrency assets, we apply the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL) function, which is more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used in algorithmic investment strategies. The MADL function results are compared between Transformer and LSTM models, and we show that in almost every case, Transformer results are significantly better than those obtained with LSTM.</description>
