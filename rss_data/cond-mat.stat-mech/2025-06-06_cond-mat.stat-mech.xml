      <title>Topology induced modifications in the critical behavior of the Yaldram Khan catalytic reaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated how the use of complex networks as catalytic surfaces can affect the phase diagram of the Yaldram-Khan model, as well as how the order of the phase transitions present in the seminal work behaves when the randomness is added to the model. The study was conducted by taking into consideration two well-known random networks, the Erdos-Renyi network (ERN), with its long-range randomness, and the random geometric graph (RGG), with its spatially constrained randomness. We perform extensive steady-state Monte Carlo simulations assuming the NO dissociation rate is equal to 1 and show the behavior of the reactive window as function of the average degree of the networks. Our results also show that, different from the ERN, which preserves the nature of the phase transitions of the original model for all considered average degrees, the RGG seems to have two second-order phase transitions for small values of average degree.</description>

      <title>It's about time: a thermodynamic information criterion (TIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Useful chemical processes often involve a desired steady state probability distribution, equilibrium or not, from which product is extracted. Given many different ways to attain the same steady state, which candidate "loses" the least in terms of time and energy? A scalar thermodynamic information criterion (TIC), inspired by AIC, assigns lower values to chemical processes with less estimated "loss" to generate the same desired steady state. As an element of thermodynamic machine learning, TIC naturally extends statistical objective optimization into the realm of chemical physics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics for classical non-Markov jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics investigates energetic/entropic bounds in small systems, such as biomolecular motors, chemical-reaction networks, and quantum nano-devices. Foundational results, including the second law and thermodynamic uncertainty relations, predominantly rely on the Markov assumption -- neglecting history dependence of physical systems. However, while physicists recognise that the Markov assumption is dubious in real experimental setups, extending stochastic thermodynamics to general non-Markov systems has proven challenging due to their mathematical complexity. Here we establish the general theory of stochastic thermodynamics for arbitrary classical non-Markov jump processes. We introduce a key technique, called the {\it Fourier embedding}, which converts any non-Markov jump process into the Markov field dynamics of auxiliary Fourier modes. This approach yields the necessary and sufficient condition for time-reversal symmetry and enables the derivation of the second law for our non-Markov systems. Our framework accommodates diverse non-Markovian dynamics in realistic experimental setups and offers a guiding principle for physics-informed modelling of history-dependent fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Time Glasses: Symmetry Broken Chaotic Phase with a Finite Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum R\'enyi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.</description>

      <title>Optimal protocol for collisional Brownian engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have recently gained attention as alternatives to conventional nanoscale engines. However, a comprehensive optimization of their performance, which could serve as a benchmark for future engine designs, is still lacking. In this work, we address this gap by deriving and analyzing the optimal driving protocol for a collisional Brownian engine. By maximizing the average output work, we show that the optimal protocol consists of linear force segments separated by impulsive delta-like kicks that instantaneously reverse the particle's velocity. This structure enforces constant velocity within each stroke, enabling fully analytical expressions for optimal output power, efficiency, and entropy production. We demonstrate that the optimal protocol significantly outperforms standard strategies (such as constant, linear, or periodic drivings) achieving higher performance while keeping entropy production under control. Remarkably, when evaluated using realistic experimental parameters, the efficiency approaches near-unity at the power optimum, with entropy production remaining well controlled, a striking feature of the optimal protocol. To analyze a more realistic scenario, we examine the impact of smoothing the delta-like forces by introducing a finite duration and find that, although this reduces efficiency and increases entropy production, the optimal protocol still delivers high power output in a robust manner. Altogether, our results provide a theoretical benchmark for finite-time thermodynamic optimization of Brownian engines under time-periodic drivings.</description>

      <title>A framework for fluctuating times and counting observables in stochastic excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases. Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions -- a framework to analyze far from equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic fluctuations of stochastic charged cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charge fluctuations of a family of stochastic charged cellular automata away from the deterministic single-file limit and obtain the exact typical charge probability distributions, known to be anomalous, using hydrodynamics. The cellular automata considered are examples of linearly degenerate systems where two distinct mechanisms of diffusion, namely normal and convective diffusion, coexist. Our formalism, based on macroscopic fluctuation theory, allows us to describe current fluctuations stemming from these two diffusive processes, and we expect it to be applicable to generic linearly degenerate systems. The derived probability distributions match the exact microscopic result and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Nonequilibrium Criticality in Run-and-Tumble Particles with Competing Motility and Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propulsion in run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) generates effective attractive interactions that can drive motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), a phenomenon absent in their passive counterparts. In this work, we show that at high motility, introducing explicit attractive interactions among RTPs can suppress MIPS, leading to a homogeneous phase, and subsequently induce a re-emergence of phase separation at stronger attraction --thus realizing a reentrant phase transition. We characterize this transition by examining the percolation properties of dense clusters, which serve as geometric signatures of phase separation. Along the resulting critical line, we observe continuously varying critical exponents, while some of the associated scaling functions remain invariant and coincide with those of equilibrium lattice gas models undergoing interacting percolation, which is Ising-percolation universality. These findings reveal that the phase separation transition in interacting RTPs exhibits Ising-like super universality, bridging nonequilibrium active matter with classical critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, a nonlinear Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing n-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every d &gt;= 1 spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities. The result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum over certain products of lower-order correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. Using Malyshev's formula, the sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call "minimal connected covers". We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic noise in one dimension: projected Kubo formula and its vanishing in integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of space and time in many-body systems. It arises by the central limit theorem applied to local microcanonical averages, representing the degrees of freedom that have been forgotten when projecting coarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It comes with "bare" diffusion terms. In one dimension of space, nonlinearities of the hydrodynamic equation are relevant (from a renormalisation perspective), usually giving rise to hydrodynamic superdiffusion. But in linearly degenerate systems, where the relevant nonlinearity vanishes, the diffusive scaling stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We show that in such systems, the noise covariance is determined in terms of a modification of the Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been subtracted. This is the projected Onsager matrix, in which so-called quadratic charges are projected out. We show that the Einstein relation holds, giving a projected bare diffusion, and that the remaining nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting regularisation. Putting these ingredients together, we obtain an exact and well-defined hydrodynamic fluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, for the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale, including the first subleading (diffusive-scale) corrections beyond large deviations. This is expressed as a stochastic PDE. We then obtain the anomalous hydrodynamic equation, which takes into account separately long-range correlations and bare diffusion. Using these result, in integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise must be absent, as was conjectured recently.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Experimental Detection of Dissipative Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the spectral properties of the $4$-fermion Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with interaction sourced from a L\'evy Stable (fat-tailed) distribution. L\'evy random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the L\'evy Stable distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the L\'evy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates is ubiquitous in living cells, promoting colocalization of enzymes and their substrates as well as achieving membrane-free compartmentalization. Energy-consuming processes are routinely used to regulate biocondensate growth by opposing the thermodynamic tendency toward coarsening. At the same time, cells often use energy to instead accelerate thermodynamic processes. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of utilizing chemical reactions to accelerate biocondensate coarsening. We combine Lifshitz-Slyozov theory with a reaction-diffusion approach, wherein particles interconvert between phase-separating and inert forms. We find that mass conservation restricts the volume growth to be linear in time (as in the passive case) despite activity, though if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our acceleration theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior. Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <title>Bacterial Chemotaxis in a Traveling Wave Attractant Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study single cell E.coli chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying attractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a traveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift velocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We find a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity changes sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave, drift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave propagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak, then changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the wave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from the difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run along the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the cell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell with respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run speed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no concentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the opposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient increases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed quantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the counter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.</description>

      <title>Chirality Amplification and Deracemization in Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously deracemize and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives deracemization is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a deracemized cholesteric phase as well as racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also predicts chirality amplification in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the deracemization transition is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal coarsening dynamics in the deracemized phase. Our results suggest that cooperative chiral ordering via molecular shape transitions is a common mechanism in liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Tuning Shear Rheology through Active Dopants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a mixture of proliferating and motile active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proliferation and motility are ubiquitous drivers of activity in biological systems. Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works indicate that heterogeneous response and non-Markovianity may yield recognizable hallmarks in the microrheology of semisolid viscoelastic materials. Here we perform numerical simulations using a non-Markovian overdamped Langevin approach to explore how the microrheology experienced by probe particles immersed in an effective semisolid material can be influenced by its micro-heterogeneities. Our results show that, besides affecting the mean squared displacement, the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the shear moduli, the micro-heterogeneities lead to displacement distributions that deviate from the usual Gaussian behavior. In addition, our study provides an analytical way to characterize the micro-heterogeneities of semisolid viscoelastic materials through their microrheology.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Quantum Quenches of Conformal Field Theory with Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method to calculate generic time-dependent correlation functions for inhomogeneous quantum quenches in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) induced by sudden Hamiltonian deformations that modulate the energy density inhomogeneously. Our work particularly focuses on the effects of spatial boundaries, which have remained unresolved by previous analytical methods. For generic post-quench Hamiltonian, we develop a generic method to calculate the correlations by mirroring the system, which otherwise are Euclidean path integrals in complicated spacetime geometries difficult to calculate. On the other hand, for a special class of inhomogeneous post-quench Hamiltonians, including the M\"obius and sine-square-deformation Hamiltonians, we show that the quantum quenches exhibit simple boundary effects calculable from Euclidean path integrals in a straightforward strip spacetime geometry. Applying our method to the time evolution of entanglement entropy, we find that for generic cases, the entanglement entropy shows discontinuities (shockwave fronts) propagating from the boundaries.In contrast, such discontinuities are absent in cases with simple boundary effects. We verify that our generic CFT formula matches well with numerical calculations from free fermion tight-binding models for various quench scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using tensor networks. Combinatorial optimization methods employing quantum gates, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm, have been intensively investigated. However, their limitations in errors and the number of qubits prevent them from handling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Alternatively, attempts have been made to solve larger-scale problems using tensor networks that can approximately simulate quantum states. In recent years, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. For the principle verification of the proposed method, we constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem and conducted imaginary time evolution. We found that feasible solutions were obtained during the evolution, ultimately leading to the optimal solution. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the discovery of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Emergent electrostatics in planar XY spin models: the bridge connecting topological order with broken $U(1)$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phases have been a central focus of condensed-matter physics for over 50 years. Along with many experimental applications, they have provided much intellectual interest due to their characterization via some form of topological ordering, as opposed to the symmetry-breaking ordering of conventional continuous phase transitions. This distinction is most subtle in the case of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition as its experimental realizations appear to break U(1) symmetry at low temperature. It also presents two further paradoxes: i) its prototypical short-range interacting planar XY spin model behaves as an emergent long-range interacting electrolyte; ii) its topological ordering is not accompanied by a topological nonergodicity within the BKT picture. This review paper addresses these three interconnected questions. We review a series of papers that demonstrate that U(1) symmetry is indeed broken, but within a broader framework than that traditionally used to characterize broken symmetry. We discuss recovery of this symmetry by breaking velocity-symmetry in a deterministic Markov process. We then expand on a modern field theory of the emergent electrolyte that maps directly from the spin field to an emergent lattice electric field governed by an augmented electrostatic Boltzmann distribution. This local model of electrolyte physics resolves both the short-range-long-range paradox and the question of topological nonergodicity - as in contrast with the BKT picture, it describes global topological defects and their nonergodic freezing by the topological ordering. It also connects the broken U(1) symmetry with the topological ordering, providing a comprehensive framework for broken symmetry at the transition. We introduce long-time topological stability as a measure of topological nonergodicity - within a general framework for weakly broken ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Markov length: a diagnostic for fault tolerance via mixed-state phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models. Finally, we propose a generalization to arbitrary energy-based models by deriving the neural tangent kernel dynamics of the score function under the score-matching algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the ideas behind the duality web to construct numerous conformal field theories mediating the phase transitions between various symmetry broken and topological phases. In particular we obtain the full field theory version of the Kennedy Tasaki transformation, mapping a gapless theory mediating a topological phase transition of symmetry protected topological orders to a standard symmetry breaking one in a 1+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four. Some of these are gapless symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398</link>

Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N&gt;2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our $\mathbb{Z}$ Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N&gt;3$.</description>
