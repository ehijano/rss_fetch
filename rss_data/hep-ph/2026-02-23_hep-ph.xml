      <title>Generating the fermion mass hierarchy at the TeV scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of theories to generate quark and lepton mass matrices where the scale of new physics is at the TeV scale, without inducing the large flavor and CP violating processes that are often thought to relegate the origin of flavor to energies above $\sim 100$ TeV. The models have new vector-like leptons and quarks, with mass mixings to each other and Yukawa couplings to light Standard Model fields encoded in "chains" reminiscent of dimensional deconstruction. Locality in the chains both generates the hierarchical Standard Model Yukawa matrices, and ensures that CP and flavor violating effects are small, even with the vector-like particles at the TeV scale. A simple extension also generates neutrino masses, whose tiny size is parametrically related to the square of the electron Yukawa coupling. We outline the essential features of these models, explain how fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles emerge, and explore their phenomenological implications. This framework can be tested both in the final run of the LHC as well as at possible future colliders operating at the 10 TeV scale, and we identify some of the distinctive experimental signatures associated with the production and decay of the new vector-like fermions.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dark Matter: Generalized Framework and Direct-Detection Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal electroweak dark matter models are compelling due to their simplicity, though calculations of their freezeout abundance are complicated by nonperturbative effects due to Sommerfeld enhancement and bound-state formation. It has been shown that all individual multiplet scenarios beyond the doublet lead to direct-detection signals above the neutrino floor and thus within the reach of next-generation experiments. If no signals are found, would minimal dark matter be excluded? Yes for the simplest models, but it has been unknown for the important extension of two multiplets coupled by Higgs interactions (Higgs-coupled minimal dark matter). We present a generalized framework for calculating nonperturbative effects for such models that also covers the case of individual multiplets. In this framework, we calculate nonperturbative effects on freezeout as well as the prospects for direct detection, correcting shortcomings and omissions in the literature. Importantly, for the mixed Majorana (odd) and Dirac (even) multiplet combinations 3M2D, 5M4D, and 7M6D, we find that the predicted direct-detection signals can extend below the neutrino floor. Fully testing minimal dark matter will thus require more than direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections to $\Lambda_b \to p $ Form Factors from Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we compute the radiative corrections to the $\Lambda_b \to p$ transition form factors at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, employing the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules with the light-cone distribution amplitudes of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon. The factorization formulae of the vacuum-to-$\Lambda_b$ correlation function, constructed from the interpolating current for the proton, are derived at leading power in $m_p / m_{\Lambda_b}$, using the method of regions. With our specific choice of interpolating current, only the twist-4 distribution amplitude of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon contributes to the form factors. Numerically, we find that the next-to-leading order QCD perturbative corrections reduce the tree-level form factors to approximately 65$\%$ of their original value, with the next-to-leading-order jet function providing the dominant contribution. In the large-energy limit ($E_p \to \infty$), the form factors exhibit a clear $1/E_p^3$ scaling, consistent with the expected power-counting behavior. By applying the $z$-series parameterization to perform a combined fit of the form factors from our results and available lattice QCD simulations, we further investigate the decay rate of $\Lambda_b \to p \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and extract the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}| = (3.33\pm 0.43 ) \times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon mediated Inelastic Dark Matter in Cosmology, Astrophysics and Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic discussion of the phenomenology of Dark Photon iDM (A$^{\prime}$iDM) where the Standard Model (SM) is extended by a dark sector containing an additional $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry under which all SM particles are neutral, and that couples to the SM hypercharge gauge boson through a kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$. The model contains two Majorana states $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ with $\delta=M_{\chi_2}-M_{\chi_1}&gt;0$ and $\chi_1$ the dark matter candidate, and a dark photon $A^{\prime}$ with mass $M_{A^{\prime}}$. Our analysis represents an integration of existing ones, where only specific benchmarks of the A$^{\prime}$iDM scenario have been discussed. In particular, we fix the $U(1)_D$ coupling $\alpha_D$ equal to the electromagnetic one $\alpha_{EM}$ and $\epsilon$ to its experimental upper bound, and perform a complete scan of the remaining parameters $(M_{\chi_1},\delta, M_{A^{\prime}})$, discussing the $\chi_1$ relic abundance, its direct and indirect searches, as well as potential signals from astrophysics and accelerators. Our systematic scan shows that $\alpha_D$ = $\alpha_{EM}$ is not disfavored, as some previous analyses, limited to specific benchmarks, may suggest. We also find that when the $\chi_1$ relic density matches observation direct and indirect searches are not kinematically accessible. On the other hand we find that the projected luminosity of FASER, a detector searching for Long Lived Particles (LLP) decay at the LHC, can probe or rule out the parameters space of the model for $M_{\chi_1}\lesssim$ 7 GeV, 100 MeV $\lesssim \delta\lesssim$ 300 MeV and $M_{A^{\prime}}\lesssim$ 25 GeV. This range of parameter could be significantly extended by the FASER 2 upgrade proposed for the High-Luminosity phase at the LHC. The parameter space probed by LLP seaches partially overlaps with that probed by $\chi_1$ capture in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Signs of universality in the behavior of elastic $\textit{pp}$ scattering cross-sections at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a phenomenological analysis of the behavior of inelastic, elastic and total cross-sections of the high energy $\textit{pp}$ interaction. In particular, we argue that the universal picture of behavior of cross-sections and their ratios is a consequence of the rapid increase of inelastic cross-section with energy and its large value compared to $\sigma_{\mathrm{el} }(s)$. We observed that the value of the fundamental ratio $(m_{\pi^{\mathrm{0}}}/m_{p}) $, the minimum value of the ratio $ (\sigma_{\mathrm{el}}/\sigma_{\mathrm{tot}})$, and some other quantities are determined by the roots of the equation $ (9\,x^{2}+4\,\sqrt{2}\,x-1)=0 $.</description>

      <title>Hidden-charm \(uds\,c\bar c\) pentaquarks as flavor eigenstates in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm to solve the Schr\"odinger equation that describes $udsc\bar c$ pentaquarks within the framework of a non-relativistic constituent quark model. We considered only multiquark states with defined values of parity, color, spin and isospin, selected to be compatible with the experimentally favored assignment $J^P=1/2^-$ for one of the candidates, and assumed $I=0$. However, we found that, to explain the existence of the $P_{cs}(4338)$ and $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquarks, we need the total wavefunction to be also an eigenvector of the SU(3) {\em flavor} operator. When we impose that condition, we obtain two structures compatible with the masses extracted from the $J/\psi\Lambda$ spectrum. In addition, two states are predicted below the $J/\psi\Lambda$ threshold but above the $\eta_c\Lambda$ one that would not appear in that channel. If we only impose the $I=0$ condition, we obtain a {\em single} (not two) structure compatible with the experimental quantum numbers, with a mass below the $J/\psi\Lambda$ threshold.</description>

      <title>MC@NLO event generation by reweighting unweighted Born events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computational strategy for NLO+PS simulations in the MC@NLO framework that starts from Born-accurate (LO) events and reweights them to the full MC@NLO S-event weight, while generating H-events separately. We validate the approach on two representative LHC processes and compare to direct NLO event generation for both standard MC@NLO and MC@NLO-Delta matching. Employing large folding values in the radiative variables stabilizes the S-event integral, reduces weight variance, and significantly lowers the fraction of negative weights compared to S-event generation without folding. At fixed precision, this pipeline has comparable wall-clock times relative to standard S-event generation and unweighting, with room for further optimisation.</description>

      <title>The Four-Jet Rate in Electron-Positron Annihilation at Order $\alpha_s^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute for the first time the production rate for four jets in electron-positron annihilation at next-to-next-to-leading order. Our calculation exhibits the highest final-state jet multiplicity considered at this perturbative accuracy to date. The cancellation of infrared singularities is achieved in the antenna subtraction scheme, relying particularly on generalized antenna functions. The evaluation of the two-loop virtual corrections is enabled by the construction of a new basis of transcendental special functions tailored to four-particle decay kinematics. Our results are compared with LEP data, finding improved agreement with respect to the next-to-leading order calculation. In the region where perturbative predictions are most reliable, we observe a significant reduction of theory uncertainties, which now fall below the experimental ones.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings via $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ Vector Boson Scattering at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the couplings between gauge bosons are tightly constrained by the principles of gauge symmetry and renormalizability. However, the presence of anomalous couplings suggests the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this study, we focus on the sensitivities of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs), specially the dimension-8 operators associated with field-strength tensor structures within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, at future Muon Colliders. Our analysis targets the neutral aQGC-sensitive processes $\mu^{+}\mu^{-} \to \mu^+ \gamma \gamma \mu^-$ and $\mu^{+} \mu^{-} \to \mu^+ Z \gamma \mu^-$, simulated at center-of-mass energies of 3 TeV and 10 TeV. Signal and background events are generated using {\sc MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, interfaced with Pythia8 for parton showering and hadronization, and Delphes for fast detector simulation. A multivariate analysis based on Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) is employed to enhance signal-to-background discrimination, utilizing a comprehensive set of kinematic and reconstructed observables from the final-state particles. Unitarity is preserved through the application of an energy-dependent clipping procedure within the EFT validity regime. Our findings indicate that future muon colliders offer significant sensitivity improvements over current experimental constraints on aQGCs. Furthermore, a comparison with other future collider scenarios shows that the 10 TeV Muon Collider, even with a 10\% systematic uncertainty, provides substantially stronger projected limits at 95\% confidence level than those currently reported by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC as well as projected limits by future hadron colliders. These results underscore the enhanced potential of high-energy muon collider to probe new physics in the electroweak sector through precision measurements of aQGCs.</description>

      <title>A quantitative study of two-loop splitting in double parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double parton distributions at small distances between the two partons are dominated by a mechanism in which the two observed partons originate from the splitting of a single parton. This contribution can be computed in terms of single-parton distributions and perturbative splitting kernels. We demonstrate that two-loop corrections to these kernels can have a substantial quantitative impact and considerably improve the stability of predictions for double parton scattering. We also consider the impact of heavy quark masses in the two-loop splitting kernels in an approximate manner.</description>

      <title>Quark-meson diquark model and color superconductivity in dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two- and three-flavor QMD models as renormalizable low-energy models for QCD at finite quark chemical potentials with quarks, mesons, and diquarks as effective degrees of freedom. Using the on-shell scheme the parameters in the scalar sector can be fixed and expressed in terms of observed meson masses and decay constants. The remaining parameters can be varied. In the QMD models, all the symmetries are global, including the $SU(N_c)$ symmetry. The breaking of the global symmetries gives rise to a number of Goldstone bosons depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern, i.e. whether the system is in the 2SC phase or the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. This is in contrast to perturbative QCD, where some of the gauge bosons become massive via the Higgs mechanism. We classify the Goldstone bosons and show that their type and number are in accordance with general counting rules. The thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ is calculated in the mean-field approximation, where we include quark loops, while mesons and diquarks are treated at tree level. As important applications, we study the properties of the pion-condensed phase at finite isospin chemical potential, and the 2SC and CFL phases at finite baryon chemical potential. We present a few numerical results focusing on the speed of sound, gaps, and condensates. It is shown that the BCS gaps approaches a constant for large isospin and baryon chemical potentials and that the speed of sound approaches the conformal value from above in the same limit.</description>

      <title>On the simulated kinematic distributions of semileptonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern measurements in flavour physics rely on accurate simulations of signal and background processes, provided by a wide range of general-purpose and specialised Monte-Carlo event generators. Due to the inclusion of a larger amount of specialised decays of heavy hadrons, EvtGen is often the tool of choice for many scenarios. We investigate the phase-space sampling algorithm of EvtGen and demonstrate that it generates unphysical features in kinematic distributions of semileptonic $B$ decays involving resonances, originating from neglected phase-space factors. We provide a short-term solution to correct the affected simulated samples through reweighting of the hadronic invariant mass distribution.</description>

      <title>Two-over-Two Lattice Flavor from a Single Flavon with Three Messenger Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor hierarchies are organized by a single parameter $B\simeq 5.357$ in a single-flavon Froggatt--Nielsen (FN) framework, in which each effective Yukawa entry arises from the sum of \emph{three} unit-magnitude messenger chains. We present benchmark complex $O(1)$ Yukawa matrices that reproduce quark and charged-lepton masses at $M_Z$ as powers of $\epsilon\equiv 1/B$. The organizing principle is a two-over-two (2/2) lattice of quadrilateral mass ratios, which maps directly to a rational lattice of FN exponents. Sequential dominance preserves the leading-power exponent matrices, while subleading messenger chains generate entry-dependent complex $O(1)$ coefficients and provide a UV-friendly origin for CP violation. Neutrino masses are discussed at the level of eigenvalues within the same $B^n$ counting.</description>

      <title>Cartography of LNV dim-9 SMEFT: Implications for Radiative Neutrino Masses and $0\nu\beta\beta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of lepton-number-violating (LNV) dimension-9 operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) that can mediate neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) at tree level, and map them to their possible tree-level ultraviolet completions. Using a diagram-based classification, we enumerate all such completions and isolate minimal two-particle models that avoid generating the dimension-5 Weinberg operator or dimension-7 LNV operators at tree level. We then chart how these minimal models populate the operator landscape and organise them by the loop order at which they radiatively induce lower-dimensional LNV operators, highlighting scenarios in which the tree-level dimension-9 contribution can compete with or dominate loop-suppressed neutrino-mass (dimension-5) effects. Representative one-loop and two-loop classes are matched onto the SMEFT, and their implications for neutrino masses, charged-lepton flavour violation, and the relative size of dimension-9 versus dimension-5 contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ are analysed, delineating regions of parameter space where upcoming experiments can be sensitive to genuinely short-range LNV dynamics.</description>

      <title>Baryon Junction and String Interactions: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study junctions between confining strings. These junctions arise in Yang-Mills theories, and we focus on their universal low-energy dynamics. Using open-closed duality, we map junctions with nonlinear corrections to the $s$-wave scattering amplitudes between confining string loops. In $(3+1)$ dimensions, we uncover an accidental $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. This symmetry implies novel selection rules for loop scattering amplitudes and is broken by the junction mass at subleading order. We determine the total mass of baryons up to order $(\text{baryon size})^{-3}$, providing new, testable predictions for lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Ly{\alpha} forest bounds on sterile neutrino production via neutrino self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range have long been considered a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we explore a sterile neutrino production mechanism through active neutrino self-interactions in the early universe, assuming that they constitute the full DM abundance. We implement a self-consistent treatment of the sterile-neutrino free streaming and the active-neutrino self-interactions on structure formation, which yield a unique scale-dependent modification to the linear matter power spectrum. We then set bounds on this scenario using a combination of the cosmic microwave background and Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints. Specifically, we utilize the two recent likelihoods derived from eBOSS data: (i) an effective field theory (EFT) based full-shape likelihood and (ii) a compressed likelihood obtained from the PRIYA-simulation emulator. We produce some of the most stringent observational constraints to date on sterile neutrino DM, comparable to the bounds from the most stringent laboratory constraints.</description>

      <title>Producing and Studying Rare Isotopes in $e+A$ Collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron--Ion Collider (EIC) offers a unique environment to study kinematically controlled lepton--nucleus (e+A) reactions, where a primary hard scattering is followed by an intranuclear cascade and the subsequent statistical de-excitation of the nuclear remnant. Utilizing the BeAGLE model, we demonstrate that event-by-event fluctuations in nucleon removal and energy deposition populate a diverse ensemble of excited remnants. Furthermore, we show that varying the target mass systematically shifts the distribution of these remnants across the (N, Z) plane. Although this excited prefragment remnant is not directly observable, its properties are shown to be strongly correlated with final-state fragments; specifically, the largest nuclear residue and the intensity of evaporation activity serve as effective experimental proxies for event-level remnant characterization. We also evaluate photon observables essential for nuclear spectroscopy. While various photon sources overlap significantly in pseudorapidity, we find that in the nucleus-rest frame, the low-energy spectrum is dominated by de-excitation $\gamma$ rays and exhibits distinct discrete structures. These findings motivate an EIC research program that correlates rare-isotope production and de-excitation radiation with well-defined initial conditions, providing a collider-based approach to nuclear spectroscopy that is complementary to existing fixed-target facilities.</description>

      <title>Higher order quantization conditions for two-body scattering with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the L\"uscher quantization condition to high order for the scattering of a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle in a periodic box. First, we derive the quantization conditions in a non-relativistic framework up to total angular momentum $J=11/2$ in both cubic and elongated geometries, and for both rest and moving frames. Then, we introduce a method to transparently cross-check their convergence, using both quantized energy levels in the box and infinite-volume phase shifts for the same potential. We clarify how to incorporate spin-orbit coupling into the formalism and show in detail how the quantization conditions converge order by order in the various irreducible representations. In all, we validated 19 quantization conditions (12 in cubic box, 7 in elongated box). This is a necessary step in applying the method in precision studies of systems in finite volume with half-integer spin, such as meson-baryon scattering.</description>

      <title>CMB anisotropies from cosmic (super)strings in light of ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on cosmic string and superstring parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. The constraints are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of the full \textit{Planck} temperature and polarization data combined with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6). For ordinary cosmic strings, we constrain the string tension $G\mu$, the string wiggliness parameter $\alpha$, and the self-chopping efficiency $\tilde{c}$. For cosmic superstrings, we constrain the fundamental string tension $G\mu_F$, the string coupling $g_s$, and a parameter $w$ describing the volume of the compact extra dimensions. In both cases, we find significantly tighter bounds on the string tension compared to previous analyses, obtaining $2\sigma$ upper limits of $G\mu &lt; 3.66\times10^{-8}$ and $G\mu_F &lt; 1.38\times10^{-8}$. We also discuss the significant prior-dependence of these results. The computational pipeline used in this work, including a modified version of \texttt{CAMB} capable of computing CMB anisotropies sourced by any active network described via unequal-time correlators, is released publicly as \texttt{CAMBactive} \cite{Raidal_CAMBactive_CAMB_extension_2026}.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress and torsion distributions in the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress distributions in the deuteron are related to form factors of the asymmetric energy-momentum tensor through three-dimensional Fourier transforms. There are eleven such form factors, which we calculate in an impulse approximation. We compare the obtained form factors to prior results for the six form factors that have been previously calculated. We then elaborate on the formalism for relating the form factors to internal distributions of mass, mass flux, momentum, stresses, and forces, and obtain results for all of these distributions. We obtain the principal stresses for the symmetric part of the stress tensor, and show that the antisymmetric part describes reorientation of fermion spin by torsion stress when the nucleon moves between the S- and D-waves. Force distributions in the nucleons depend on the so-called non-conserved form factors through the Cauchy momentum equation, and are non-radial owing to the presence of tensor forces and spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Temperature-Dependent Interaction between Dark Matter and Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of the temperature-dependent interaction between dark matter (DM) and neutrinos on the measurement of cosmological parameters. We pay attention to the neutrino mass effects, so that the derivation of Boltzmann equations needs to specify the concrete form of interaction. We work in a model in which the DM-neutrino scatterings are induced by a dimension-six operator, and present the details for deriving the full Boltzmann hierarchy for DM and neutrinos, including a novel method to obtain the fluid approximation for modes entering the horizon. It is shown that our interaction can induce the dark acoustic oscillation in the DM-neutrino fluid, leaving distinct signatures on the CMB and matter power spectra. By using the latest CMB and BAO datasets from Planck, DESI and ACT, the constraint on today's DM-neutrino interaction parameter for the normal neutrino mass ordering reaches $u^0_{\chi-\nu} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-13})$, nearly nine orders stronger than that for temperature-independent case in the literature. This can be understood by noting that the scattering cross section increases nearly quadratically with cosmological temperature in the early universe, leading to enhanced effects. We have investigated alternative scenarios with different neutrino mass assumptions. In particular, models with degenerate neutrino masses give rise to weaker constraint of $u^0_{\chi-\nu} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-11})$, showing the importance to incorporate the realistic neutrino mass ordering in the fits. Finally, when employing the logarithmic flat prior for $u^0_{\chi-\nu}$, we have shown hints to a nonzero interaction at $95\%$ CL by combining Planck, DESI and ACT data.</description>

Abstract: We report first results from RadioAxion, an underground experiment searching for axion dark matter through periodic modulations of radioisotope decays. We monitor the $\alpha$ decay of $^{241}\mathrm{Am}$ via its $59.5$ keV $\gamma$ line using a NaI detector installed at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, where cosmic-ray-induced systematics are strongly suppressed. We present the measured spectra and the corresponding time-series analysis. No evidence for a periodic modulation is observed. From these data we derive constraints on the axion decay constant in the axion mass range from $10^{-21}$ to $10^{-9}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dark Matter Searches Using Integrated Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) with masses of order an electronvolt or below can have a non-zero coupling to electromagnetism while being compatible with cosmological observations. In these models, the ambient DM behaves as a new classical source in Maxwell's equations, which can excite potentially detectable electromagnetic (EM) fields in the laboratory. We propose a new integrated photonics-based approach to search for DM candidates in the 0.1 - few eV mass range. This approach offers a wide range of wavelength-scale devices like resonators and waveguides that are readily fabricated in large quantities, enabling a scalable and novel search. In particular, we demonstrate that refractive index-modulated resonators, such as etched/grooved microrings, or patterned slabs, support EM modes with efficient coupling to DM. When excited by DM, these modes are read out by coupling the resonators to a waveguide that terminates on a micron-scale-sized single photon detector, such as a single pixel of a low-noise charge-coupled device or a superconducting nanowire. We then estimate the sensitivity of this experimental concept in the context of axion-like particle and dark photon models of DM, demonstrating that nanophotonic confinement and scalability can extend dark matter sensitivity into previously unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Window quantities for the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment in spacelike and timelike domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relations between the window quantities for the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ in spacelike and timelike domains are studied. Two types of window functions (abrupt and smooth) as well as two kinds of kinematic intervals (symmetric and asymmetric with respect to the spacelike/timelike flip) are addressed. It is shown that the window quantities for $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ represented in terms of the hadronic vacuum polarization function $\bar\Pi(Q^2)$, the Adler function $D(Q^2)$, and the $R$-ratio of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons are mutually equivalent only if the additional contributions due to the window edge effects are properly taken into account and the explicit expressions for such contributions are derived. The obtained results enable one to evaluate $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ by making simultaneous use of the inputs for functions $\bar\Pi(Q^2)$, $D(Q^2)$, and $R(s)$ at various energies and an example of such hybrid assessment is provided. The obtained results also enable one to accurately compare the window quantities for $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ based, e.g., on MUonE or lattice data with the ones based on $R$-ratio data, even if the window function covers different kinematic ranges in spacelike and timelike domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review theoretical frameworks in which small neutrino masses arise radiatively through interactions with a dark sector that also accounts for cosmological dark matter (DM). A prototype is provided by scotogenic schemes, that extend the inert Higgs doublet model to include dark fermions. We outline their key features and limitations, discussing the advantages of the revamped scotogenic extension. The phenomenological signatures of fermionic and bosonic scotogenic dark matter are discussed, along with scoto-seesaw models that merge scotogenic and seesaw mechanisms. We also consider scenarios where the dark sector seeds a low-scale seesaw. These frameworks can accommodate dark matter as Weakly or Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs or FIMPs). While hidden dark sector models are inherently difficult to exclude, visible dark sector schemes should be confirmed--or ruled out--by forthcoming dark matter, collider, and lepton flavor violation studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a case study exploring the potential of OpenAI's o3 model as a process-agnostic tool (within fixed topology) for predicting optimized selection cuts in high-energy physics analyses. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of the model in separating signal from relevant Standard Model backgrounds in the context of Flavour-Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) top-quark couplings, focusing on the rare decay process t \rightarrow uZ. The study is performed at the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh) setup. We prompt the o3 model on detector level data for signal and background processes to predict selection cuts that enhance Signal-to-Background (S/B) discrimination. A comparative analysis is then carried out between the efficiencies resulting from o3-predicted cuts, TMVA BDT separation and those derived from traditional manually designed strategies used by a control group; all utilizing the same parameters for the sake of the integrity of the study. Our results demonstrate that the o3 model performs a degree better than the control group, suggesting its promise as a fast and generalizable tool for new physics searches. Meanwhile, BDT results were considerably higher than both the o3 and the traditional cut-based methods. Furthermore, in order to test its limitations, o3 cuts were applied to data generated via the approved High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and the proposed High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) setup in order to examine its effectiveness at different energy scales when provided with data at FCC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>

Our results demonstrate how even small {higher order} deformations of the Ricci scalar (e.g. $R^3, R^4,\cdots$) can bring the model into better agreement with current data and impose nontrivial constraints on the post-inflationary dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $+\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

Abstract: While Transformer-based and standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be the best performers in classifying different types of jets, they require substantial computational power. We explore the scope of using a lightweight and scalable version of EfficientNet architecture, along with global features of the jet. The end product is computationally inexpensive but is capable of competitive performance. We showcase the efficacy of our network in tagging top-quark jets in a sea of other light quark and gluon jets. The work also sheds light on the importance of global features for both the accuracy and the apparent redundancy of the network's complexity.</description>

      <title>Probing Internal Conversion and Dark-Matter-Induced De-excitation of 180mTa with a gamma-ray TES Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $\gamma$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3\sigma$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$ yr and $0.66$ yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Wave-like amplification of near-threshold two-particle reactions: from muon-catalyzed fusion to $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ production at $e^-e^+$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple model is proposed to explain the recently found wave-like enhancement of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pair production near the threshold at the $e^-e^+$ annihilation, which allows extracting parameters of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ interaction and the $\Lambda$-hyperon rms-radius from the oscillatory nature of the measured cross section. In particular, it predicts a single bound state of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ with a binding energy of $\varepsilon_{\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}}=(36\pm5)$MeV. The model is a generalization of the formulas obtained in our earlier work [1] to explain the effect of wave-like amplification found in it near the threshold of fusion reactions screened by a muon or electron. The analysis allows us to conclude that the effect of wave-like amplification is an integral feature of any two-particle near-threshold reaction. In this regard, it seems promising to investigate, within the framework of our model, the oscillatory nature of the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons and nucleons extracted in experiments on $e^- e^+$ annihilation. A natural further development of the model could be its generalization to processes of producing various hadron pairs in $e^-e^+$ annihilation.</description>

Abstract: We analytically discuss the resonance conditions among several neutrinos in matter. The discriminant for the characteristic equation of the Hamiltonian is expressed by the coefficients of the equation. The result of the computation for the discriminants tells us that the neutrino energy and the matter density are in inverse proportion to each other at the resonance states in not only 2- but also 3- and 4-neutrino models.</description>

      <title>Decoherence from quantum spacetime noise: An open-systems framework with application to neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general open-quantum-systems framework to model decoherence induced by stochastic Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime, focusing on the kappa-Minkowski noncommutative geometry as a representative quantum-gravity scenario. Treating the deformation parameter as Gaussian white noise, we derive a Lindblad-type master equation applicable to arbitrary quantum systems and obtain a distinctive inverse-energy scaling of the decoherence rate, Gamma proportional to E^{-4}. As an illustrative example, we analyze a three-level system motivated by neutrino flavor oscillations and derive closed-form expressions for survival and transition probabilities with spacetime-induced damping. The E^{-4} scaling contrasts sharply with the positive power laws often invoked in quantum-gravity phenomenology and predicts negligible decoherence for high-energy neutrinos consistent with IceCube observations, while implying that the strongest effects arise in the extreme low-energy regime. In this context, the sub-eV-scale energies characteristic of the cosmic neutrino background provide a natural infrared benchmark for illustrating the enhanced sensitivity to quantum-spacetime fluctuations. Our results establish a unified formalism connecting quantum-information methods, open-system dynamics, and quantum-spacetime phenomenology, thereby offering a framework for exploring potential signatures of Planck-scale physics in future low-energy neutrino studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient classification of electromagnetic activity from $\pi^0$ and electrons remains an open problem in the reconstruction of neutrino interactions in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors. We address this problem using the mathematical framework of Optimal Transport (OT), which has been successfully employed for event classification in other HEP contexts and is ideally suited to the high-resolution calorimetry of LArTPCs. Using a publicly available simulated dataset from the MicroBooNE collaboration, we show that OT methods achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in $e/\pi^0$ classification. The success of this first application indicates the broader promise of OT methods for LArTPC-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early Universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, for primordial black holes with masses exceeding $10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$, the associated stochastic background lies within the frequency range accessible to current and upcoming cosmic microwave background experiments, thereby providing a direct observational way to probe the existence of such extremely massive objects.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reduction using Syzygy-Constrained Symbolic Reduction Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding computational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The algorithm starts with solving syzygy equations in individual sectors to produce IBP operators that turn seed integrals into IBP equations without artificially raised propagator powers. The IBP operators are expressed in terms of index-shift operators and number operators. We perform row reduction to systematically reshuffle the IBP operators and expose reduction rules with symbolic dependence on the powers of propagators and numerators. When this is insufficient, we produce more symbolic reduction rules by directly solving the linear system of IBP equations in which some propagator/numerator powers are kept symbolic. This linear system is kept small, as the equations are generated from a small set of seed integrals in the neighborhood of the target integral. We stress-test our algorithm against two highly non-trivial examples, namely rank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless pentabox. As an application, we revisit the IBP reduction in a calculation of scattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems, which involves two-loop Feynman integrals with complexity greater than 20, and achieve much faster IBP reduction than that of the original calculation.</description>

      <title>New Interpretations of the Cosmological Preference for a Negative Neutrino Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) show some tension with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For one, the cosmological parameters determined by the CMB are at odds with the expansion history determined by latest BAO measurements. In addition, the combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass. Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing. In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields. However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard Model physics.</description>

      <title>Amortized Inference of Multi-Modal Posteriors using Likelihood-Weighted Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for amortized posterior estimation using Normalizing Flows trained with likelihood-weighted importance sampling. This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.</description>

      <title>Multi-neutron correlations in light nuclei via ab-initio lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand multi-neutron systems has a long history, and recent experimental efforts aim to probe candidate four-neutron configurations in neutron-rich light nuclei such as ${}^8$He and ${}^7$H via quasi-free knockout reactions. However, the ground-state energies of the hydrogen isotopes ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H are not yet well constrained, with substantial discrepancies across experimental analyses and theoretical predictions. Using ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory with an ensemble of 282 chiral two- and three-nucleon forces, we perform a Bayesian uncertainty-quantified analysis of the ground-state energies of ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H. The marginal posteriors suggest single-neutron separation energy $S_n({}^{7}\mathrm{H})=0.35^{+0.32}_{-0.32}$ MeV, which kinematically disfavors sequential decay via ${}^{6}\mathrm{H}+n$ and thereby makes multi-neutron emission channels comparatively more relevant. Intrinsic densities indicate triton- and $\alpha$-like clusters in ${}^7$H and ${}^8$He, respectively. By computing two-body and reduced four-body correlation functions, we find that the valence neutrons in the surface region of these systems form compact dineutrons that predominantly organize into approximately symmetric dineutron-dineutron configurations, with only a small but non-negligible fraction assembling into more compact tetraneutron-like substructures. In ${}^7$H, these components account for roughly 95\% and 5\% of the sampled four-neutron configurations, respectively, and ${}^8$He exhibits a similar hierarchy. For these configurations, we also extract the corresponding spatial and angular correlation patterns among the nucleons. These results provide nuclear-structure insights into the debate surrounding four-neutron clusters and complement ongoing experimental searches for tetraneutron signatures in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>
