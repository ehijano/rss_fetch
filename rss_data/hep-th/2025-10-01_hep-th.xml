      <title>Aspects of holographic entanglement using physics-informed-neural-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement physics-informed-neural-networks (PINNs) to compute holographic entanglement entropy and entanglement wedge cross section. This technique allows us to compute these quantities for arbitrary shapes of the subregions in any asymptotically AdS metric. We test our computations against some known results and further demonstrate the utility of PINNs in examples, where it is not straightforward to perform such computations.</description>

      <title>Holography vs. Scale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we point out a contradiction between holography and scale-separated AdS (i.e. parametrically large mass gap) in string theory, making the standard assumption that the holographic CFT describes the IR degrees of freedom on a brane that decouple from gravity. We show that the CFT can only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS satisfies a certain criterion. Namely, there must exist a scalar field trajectory that follows the gradient of the scalar potential to the asymptotic region of the scalar field space in which limit $V\sim m^\alpha$, where $\alpha\leq 2$ is a constant and $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower of states. This condition, which implies lack of scale-separation, is satisfied in the standard examples of AdS/CFT. However, proposed attempts at achieving scale separation, such as DGKT, employ scalar potentials that scale as $m^\alpha$ with $\alpha&gt;2$ in the asymptotic region of moduli space. We therefore conclude that the CFT duals of DGKT vacua cannot exist in string theory. Barring fine-tuning, our conclusions apply to other Ricci-flat flux compactifications including the KKLT scenario which relies on scale separation to obtain a metastable de Sitter uplift.</description>

      <title>Null matter and the ultrarelativistic origin of hydrodynamics at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a universal sector of relativistic fluid dynamics by taking a novel ultrarelativistic limit in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow simultaneously approaches the speed of light. In this regime, hydrodynamics becomes an effective theory of \emph{null matter}, characterised by a preferred null vector, a preferred scale, and their gradients. We show that this theory of null matter constitutes an example of a hydrodynamic theory that can be linearly stable and causal in an arbitrary choice of frame. The framework developed here for null matter can offer insights into ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysical phenomena with inherently large Lorentz factors, and the dynamics of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <title>An analytic approach for holographic entanglement entropy at (quantum) criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider holographic entanglement entropy in AdS black hole backgrounds by using the limit of large number of dimensions. By dividing the geometry to two patches (with one patch covering the vicinity of the black hole horizon and another covering the other regions), we are able to obtain fully analytic expressions for the entropy when the entanglement region is a strip. We argue that apart from conformal field theories at finite temperature in high number of dimensions, our method works for nearly critical theories in 3+1 dimensions. In the case of extremal black holes, dual to quantum critical systems, the results take a particularly simple form. We also comment on the case of soliton geometries. Finally, we analyze entanglement entropy for wide strips, and propose a general formula for the first subleading term in the expansion of the entropy in (inverse) system size for generic entanglement regions.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Quantum Particles in Global de Sitter Spacetime II: Scalars in Deep Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the S-matrix formalism developed in Part I to the interacting scalar theory in four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. The amplitudes are computed in the angular momentum basis, appropriate to the representations of $SO(1,4)$ de Sitter symmetry group. We discuss the properties of wavefunctions in Bunch-Davies vacuum and derive a new integral representation for the Feynman propagator. We focus on deep infrared processes probing the large scale structure of spacetime, in particular on the processes that are normally forbidden by the energy-momentum conservation laws in flat spacetime. We find that there are no stable particles in self-interacting scalar field theory, but the decay rates are exponentially suppressed for particles with masses far above $\hbar/c\ell$, where $\ell$ is the de Sitter radius. We also show that the ``all out'' amplitudes describing multiparticle production from the vacuum are identically zero, hence Bunch-Davies vacuum is stable with respect to the matter interactions. We show that at the tree level, all scattering amplitudes are infrared finite, well-defined functions of quantum numbers. They have no kinematic singularities, except for the processes involving conformally coupled scalars.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Running of CPT Operators In Lorentz-Violating Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional relativistic quantum field theory, the discrete operators C, P, and T are matrix operators with no renormalization scale dependence. However, in a Lorentz-violating theory with a fermion $f^{\mu}$ term in the action, these operators may acquire nontrivial renormalization group behavior. Because the $f^{\mu}$ term may actually be exchanged in the action for an equivalent $c^{\nu\mu}$ term, the scale dependence depends explicitly on the renormalization scheme, even at one-loop order. The scheme dependence means it is always possible to set the scale dependence parameter $X$ to zero, but for analyses of some high-energy electron-photon processes, using a scheme with $X=1$--and thus definite scale dependence for C, P, and T--may nonetheless be more convenient.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics of Scalar Particles in a Spinning Cosmic String Background with Topological Defects: A Feshbach-Villars Formalism Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relativistic quantum dynamics of spin-0 particles in the spacetime of a spinning cosmic string that carries both spacelike disclination (conical deficit $\alpha$) and screw dislocation (torsion $J_z$), as well as frame dragging ($J_t$). Using the Feshbach-Villars (FV) reformulation of the Klein-Gordon equation, we obtain a first-order Hamiltonian with a positive-definite density, enabling a clean probabilistic interpretation for bosons in curved or topologically nontrivial backgrounds. In the weak-field regime (retaining terms $\mathcal{O}(G)$ and discarding the $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ contribution that would otherwise lead to double-confluent Heun behavior), separation of variables in a finite cylinder of radius $R_0$ yields a Bessel radial equation with an effective index $\nu(\alpha, J_t, J_z; E, k)$ that mixes rotation and torsion. The hard-wall condition $J_\nu(\kappa R_0) = 0$ quantizes the spectrum, $E_n^2 = m^2 + k^2 + \left(\frac{j_{\nu,n}}{R_0}\right)^2$. Working in the stationary positive-energy sector, we derive closed-form normalized eigenfunctions and FV density, and we evaluate information-theoretic indicators (Fisher information and Shannon entropy) directly from the FV probability density. We find that increased effective confinement (via geometry/torsion) enhances Fisher information and reduces position-space Shannon entropy, quantitatively linking defect parameters to localisation/complexity. The FV framework thus provides a robust, computationally transparent route to spectroscopy and information measures for scalar particles in rotating/torsional string backgrounds, and it smoothly reproduces the pure-rotation, pure-torsion, and flat-spacetime limits.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect between semitransparent mirrors in a Lorentz-violating background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect for a massless scalar field confined between two parallel semitransparent mirrors in a vacuum modified by spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. Using Green's function techniques and a point-splitting evaluation of the stress-energy tensor, we compute the vacuum expectation value of the energy density $T_{00}$. After a suitable renormalization, the Casimir energy is obtained as the difference between the vacuum configurations with and without the mirrors. We derive closed-form expressions that generalize the conventional result by simultaneously incorporating the mirror transparency and the Lorentz-violating background. Our analysis shows that the effect of transparency and Lorentz violation consists of a multiplicative correction and an effective rescaling of the plate separation, thereby modifying the functional dependence of the energy on the distance. Beyond the formal derivation, we discuss possible physical realizations of this framework, emphasizing anisotropic media such as nematic liquid crystals (e.g., 5CB), where uniaxial dielectric properties could emulate the Lorentz-violating background. Numerical estimates for such systems illustrate the phenomenological impact of our results and open the possibility of constraining Lorentz-violating coefficients through precision Casimir measurements.</description>

      <title>Local vertices, quadratic propagators and double-copy structure of one-loop integrands from forward limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By worldsheet approach, $n$-point one-loop integrand can be expressed as a combination of $(n+2)$-point tree-level bi-adjoint scalar (BS) amplitudes under forward limit. The integrands constructed by this approach have two closely related features that are different from conventional Feynman diagrams. First, the denominators of loop propagators are linear functions of the loop momentum. Second, the local vertex expression is not manifest. In our previous work, a systematic approach was proposed to handle the nonlocal terms in the one-loop integrand of Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) theory. Upon canceling the nonlocalities, quadratic propagator forms of both YMS and Yang-Mills (YM) integrands are naturally obtained. In this paper, we generalize the calculation to theories involving gravitons by introducing the one-loop double Yang-Mills-scalar (dYMS) integrands. The cancellation of the nonlocalities of the dYMS integrand in the forward limit coincides with the emergence of local multi-point vertices. We provide two equivalent methods for extracting the vertices and give the final expression of the dYMS integrand with quadratic propagators. In this formula, tree-level effective subcurrents, which exhibit double-copy structures, are attached to the loop propagator line via the local vertices constructed. The quadratic propagator formulas for Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) and gravity (GR) integrands are further derived, by the help of the formula for dYMS. The extraction of local vertices in one-loop dYMS integrand also applies at tree-level, thus we have the corresponding expressions of tree-level dYMS, EYM, and GR amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In Part I, we showed that the infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical spectrum is restricted to global isometries.</description>

Abstract: We apply localization techniques to topologically $A$-twisted $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric theories of vector and chiral multiplets on $S^{2}$ and derive a novel exact formula for abelian observables, described by a distribution integrated along the real line. The distributional integral formula is verified by evaluating the correlator of the $A$-twisted $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ gauged linear sigma model and confirming the standard selection rule. Finally, we use hyperfunctions to demonstrate the equivalence between the distributional and complex contour integral descriptions of the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ correlator, and find agreement with the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue prescription.</description>

      <title>Abelian 3D TQFT gravity, ensemble holography and stabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model of 3D quantum gravity based on abelian topological quantum field theory (TQFT), by defining the gravitational path-integral as a sum over all 3D topologies with genus-$g$ boundary $\Sigma_g$. The path-integral of an abelian TQFT $\mathcal T$ on any single topology with boundary $\Sigma_g$ prepares a stabilizer state. This way, $\mathcal T$ partitions all these topologies into finitely many equivalence classes, where each topology within a class is associated with the same stabilizer state. The gravitational path-integral can thus be rephrased as a weighted sum over representative topologies, which are further organized into orbits under the mapping class group of $\Sigma_g$. One orbit is represented by handlebodies, whose average reproduces the ``Poincar\'e series of the vacuum", while additional orbits describe non-handlebody topologies. The resulting quantum gravity state is $Sp(2g,\mathbb Z)$-invariant and can be expressed as a weighted average of 2D CFT partition functions on $\Sigma_g$. This establishes a duality between a weighted sum over bulk topologies and a weighted sum over boundary CFTs. We introduce the ``$\lambda$-matrix", which relates bulk and boundary weights. The $\lambda$-matrix can be fully determined by the set of topological boundary conditions that the TQFT admits, and we present a systematic procedure to construct this set. Using this framework, we evaluate the $\lambda$-matrix and the TQFT gravity state in several tractable examples.</description>

      <title>Study of chaos and scrambling in hairy AdS Soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the classical and quantum chaos in a candidate five-dimensional hairy AdS soliton. It is a horizonless geometry holographically dual to a confining field theory with finite scalar potential. We probe classical chaos by using particle geodesics and closed classical string. While the former shows no signature of chaos, the latter provides chaotic dynamics of the string using the Lyapunov exponent and the evolution of the Poincar\'e section. Further we perform an independent spectral analysis using the tools of the random matrix theory (RMT), namely the level space distributions and the Dyson-Mehta(DM) $\Delta_{3}$-statistics. We observe a clear transition from the low energy Wigner-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) distribution to the high energy Poisson distribution. This signifies a flow from quantum chaos in the infrared to integrability in the ultraviolet. We quantitatively characterize the inherent quantum scrambling in the dual theory by computing the butterfly velocity, the rate of spatial spread of the information scrambling, inside the bulk. We undergo two independent holographic methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction and derivation of out-of-time-ordered correlators via shockwave analysis. In these methods, we heuristically treat the region near the soliton tip to analyse the infrared physics of scrambling similarly as done in the near-horizon region of black hole. We find that the hair parameter controls various scrambling properties. Finally, we make comments on the interplay between insulator/superconductor phase transition in hairy soliton geometry and dynamical transition from integrability to chaos as both of these are affected by the presence of the hair parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project, we will study a bottom$-$up holographic model for the color superconductivity (CSC) phase in the Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet (EGB) gravity. We consider the color superconductivity in the deconfinement phase which is dual to the planar GB$-$RN$-$AdS black hole in six-dimensional spacetime and we find the equation of state of the CSC phase in the inner core of the heavy compact star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holography implies scattering in the bulk can be mediated by entanglement on the boundary. The connected wedge theorem (CWT) of May, Penington, and Sorce is a concrete example where bulk scattering implies correlation between certain boundary regions. However the converse does not hold. We investigate a recent proposal of Leutheusser and Liu for a generalization of the CWT with converse. We prove the forward direction: having pairs of CFT ``input'' (and likewise ``output'') regions in a phase with connected entanglement wedge implies that a particular bulk subregion (the intersection of ``input'' and ``output'' entanglement wedges) is non-empty. We then establish a modified version of the proposal which has a converse, and identify counter-examples to the stronger conjecture.</description>

      <title>Long-range minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlocal conformal field theories in two dimensions which are obtained as deformations of the Virasoro minimal models. The construction proceeds by coupling a relevant primary operator $\phi_{r,s}$ of the $m$-th minimal model to a generalized free field, in such a way that the interaction term has scaling dimension $2-\delta$. Flowing to the infrared, we reach a new class of CFTs that we call long-range minimal models. In the case $r=s=2$, the resulting line of fixed points, parametrized by $\delta$, can be studied using two perturbative expansions with different regimes of validity, one near the mean-field theory end, and one close to the long-range to short-range crossover. This is due to a straightforward generalization of an infrared duality which was proposed for the long-range Ising model ($m = 3$) in 2017. We find that the large-$m$ limit is problematic in both perturbative regimes, hence nonperturbative methods will be required in the intermediate range for all values of $m$. For the models based on $\phi_{1,2}$, the situation is rather different. In this case, only one perturbative expansion is known but it is well behaved at large $m$. We confirm this with a computation of infinitely many anomalous dimensions at two loops. Their large-$m$ limits are obtained from both numerical extrapolations and a method we develop which carries out conformal perturbation theory using Mellin amplitudes. For minimal models, these can be accessed from the Coulomb gas representations of the correlators. This method reveals analytic expressions for some integrals in conformal perturbation theory which were previously only known numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplitude of an excited shape mode in a kink is expected to decay with a well-known power law via scalar radiation emission due to the nonlinear self-coupling of the scalar field. In this work we propose an alternative decay mechanism via pair production of fermions in a simple extension of the $\phi^4$ model in which the scalar field is coupled to a (quantum) fermionic field through a Yukawa-like interaction term. We study the power emitted through fermions as a function of the coupling constant in the semi-classical limit (without backreaction) and compare it to the case of purely scalar radiation emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal defects spontaneously break part of the symmetry algebra of a bulk CFT. We show that the broken Ward identities imply very general sum rules on the defect CFT data as well as on the DOE data of bulk operators, which we call defect soft theorems. Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones, including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact, optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals.</description>

Abstract: The standard model of particle physics relies heavily on the idea of symmetry. But recently, a new geometry-first picture has been proposed in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. Here, I extend the initial correspondence to include alternative -- and more transparent -- accounts of spontaneous symmetry breaking and of the Yukawa coupling: both fundamental for particles to have masses. These reformulations allow us to replace explanations that employ typical particle physics ideas and terminology with ones that are phrased geometrically</description>

      <title>The Hubble tension as an effect of the renormalization of fundamental constants and cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter we propose an interpretation of the Hubble tension as an effect of the scale-running of cosmological parameters and fundamental constants, as the Newton's constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Namely, the tension between $H_0$ measurements by CMB and Supernovae observations would be a consequence of the fact that the value of $H_0$ depends (due to the running of $G$ and $\Lambda$) on the scale at which it is measured. Indeed, the two different values of the Hubble parameter today correspond to the two different cosmological scales at which Supernovae and CMB measurements probe our universe. We discuss some possible theoretical scenarios in which the running of $G$ and $\Lambda$ can occur. We stress that one should interpret such a running as a scale-dependence of the cosmological parameters and fundamental constants at the same time rather than a time dependence, as it is usually considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tensions in the era of precision cosmology: Insights from Tensions in Cosmology 2025</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``Tensions in Cosmology'' series of conferences has been established as one of the main venues where the cosmological community collectively assesses the cracks in the concordance model and explores possible theoretical and observational remedies. The 2025 edition, held once again in Corfu, Greece, came at a crucial time: the Hubble constant $H_0$ discrepancy has now exceeded $6\sigma$, and new high-precision data from DESI, JWST, ACT, and other facilities have made this tension more robust while opening new windows on the early and late Universe. The $S_8$ tension, though milder and survey-dependent, remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Here we provide a report on the meeting and an update on the state of the tensions in 2025, highlighting progress since the pioneering 2022 event.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how inflation can emerge from four-fermion interactions generated by spacetime torsion, eliminating the need for additional scalar fields beyond the Standard Model. We partition fermions in two sectors and introduce two bound fields. In the effective theory approach, once all the fermions have been integrated out, the bound fields serve as the inflaton and the auxiliary field, in analogy to the hybrid inflation and accounting for a waterfall (hybrid) mechanism. The inclusion of an axial chemical potential naturally facilitates the end of reheating. During the waterfall regime, the effective potential governing the fermion condensate supports the formation of non-topological solitons, known as Q-balls, which can be accounted for seeding primordial black holes (PBHs).</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling superconductivity near Gross-Neveu quantum criticality in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As illustrated by Wigner, all symmetries forming a group structure (and hence invertible) must be either unitary or antiunitary. Relinquishing this assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Krylov Winding and Emergent Coherence in Operator Growth Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha &lt;1$, the winding with Pauli size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.</description>

      <title>Cosmic domain walls on a lattice: illusive effects of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in the study of scattering amplitudes have uncovered profound and unexpected connections with combinatorial geometry. These connections range from classical structures -- such as polytopes, matroids, and Grassmannians -- to more modern developments including positroid varieties and the amplituhedron. Together they point toward the unifying framework of positive geometry, in which geometric domains canonically determine analytic functions governing scattering processes. This survey traces the emergence of positive geometry from the physics of amplitudes, building towards recent progress on amplitudes for matroids.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Helicity, Magnetic Monopoles, and Higgs Winding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields,
  from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology.
  It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$. However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime. In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles.
  We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change.
  The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the chiral anomaly in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on $\phi$CDM dynamical dark energy cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field $\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ models where $A_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and $1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H_0=67.55_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega_m = 0.3096 \pm 0.0055$, $\sigma_8 = 0.8013_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A_L = 1.105 \pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard parametrix on half-Minkowski with Robin boundary conditions: Fundamental solutions and Hadamard states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of constructing fundamental solutions and Hadamard states for a Klein-Gordon field in half-Minkowski spacetime with Robin boundary conditions in $d \geq 2$ spacetime dimensions. First, using a generalisation of the Robin-to-Dirichlet map exploited by Bondurant and Fulling [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 38} 7 (2005)] in dimension $2$, we obtain a representation for the advanced and retarded Green operators in terms of a convolution with the kernel of the inverse Robin-to-Dirichlet map. This allows us to prove the uniqueness and support properties of the Green operators. Second, we obtain a local representation for the Hadamard parametrix that provides the correct local definition of Hadamard states in $d \geq 2$ dimensions, capturing `reflected' singularities from the spacetime boundary. We show that our fundamental solutions abide by this local parametrix representation. Finally, we prove the equivalence of our local Hadamard condition and the global Hadamard condition with a wave-front set described in terms of generalized broken bi-characteristics, obtaining a Radzikowski-like theorem in half-Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Axionic model in N = 1 Wess-Zumino gauge from CFJ approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose behind this work has been to construct a Supersymmetric extension of Axionic Electrodynamics based on a Lorentz Symmetry-Violating framework. Thus, in addition to the axion and the photon, our model naturally incorporates its supersymmetric partners - the axino and the photino - and allows for the interaction between them. This enriches the Axionic Electrodynamics not only from a theoretical standpoint but also for its phenomenological relevance, providing additional interactions between possible dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in a fast scrambling system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration -- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (cSYK) model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Using net quark number gain to probe the phases of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss an observable that probes the content of a QCD medium at finite temperature and chemical potential, the net quark number gain. It is the response of the thermal bath to a static quark or antiquark probe. While insignificant at high temperatures, it reveals the bath's tendency to form meson-like or baryon-like configurations (depending on the probe and chemical potential) at low temperatures, which would screen the probe's color charge. The net quark number gain also helps explain how a single quark/antiquark can be added to a supposedly confining medium in the first place: the latter provides the missing quarks/antiquarks to form hadron-like states. We sketch the derivation of this general result for temperatures much smaller than the constituent quark masses and discuss possible further applications to study the various features of the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Polynomials and asymptotic constants in a resurgent problem from 't Hooft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n&gt;0}\sqrt{n}z^n$ for $|z|&lt;1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n\in{\mathbb Z}}(2n\pi{\rm i}-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-e^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion $e^{-u}\sum_{k\ge0}P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. These polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x) R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants that have been determined at 100-digit precision. Their exact values remain to be identified. This work combines results from David C. Woods, on fractional polylogarithms, with evaluations of Hurwitz zeta values by Pari/GP.</description>

      <title>Strong random unitaries and fast scrambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how fast physical systems can resemble Haar-random unitaries is a fundamental question in physics. Many experiments of interest in quantum gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve queries to a random unitary $U$ alongside its inverse $U^\dagger$, conjugate $U^*$, and transpose $U^T$. However, conventional notions of approximate unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions achieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits. We further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth $O(\log^2 n)$ in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that strong PRUs can form in circuit depth $\text{poly}(\log n)$ in circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic times.</description>

Abstract: Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</description>

Abstract: We apply localization techniques to $A$-twisted $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories of vector multiplets on $S^{2}$. We derive formulae for $A$-model partition functions and correlators as integrals along a real contour, as opposed to a complex one. Using the correlator formula, we successfully recover the unstable instanton partition function of pure two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory from the vacuum expectation value of an $A$-model operator.</description>

      <title>Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. One of the best-known examples of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Despite extensive work on holographic thermodynamics, heat engines for CFT thermal states have not been explored. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT.</description>

      <title>Shadows of a Non-Commutative Black Hole under the Influence of a Magnetized Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the shadow cast by a black hole (BH) in a non-commutative spacetime surrounded by a plasma medium. BHs in a plasma environment can exhibit complex interactions that profoundly affect their shadow properties. In specific terms, we consider a special type of plasma medium motivated from the interactions among axions, photons and plasma excitations, or commonly termed as axion-plasmon in the presence of a magnetic field. We have studied the effect of these plasma parameters and the non-commutative parameter on the shadow properties by focusing particularly on the photon sphere radius, angular shadow and the shadow observed from the observer's perspective. For this we have considered two different forms of plasma, viz homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma. In this work we have presented the parameter dependence of these BH shadow properties. Finally, we have also studied the energy emission rate of the BH and how it depends on the model and plasma parameters.</description>

      <title>Loop Hori Formulae for T-duality and Twisted Bismut-Chern Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to establish the loop space formulation of T-duality in the presence of background flux. In particular, we construct a loop space analogue of the Hori formula, termed \textbf{the loop Hori map}, and demonstrate that it induces a quasi-isomorphism between the exotic twisted equivariant cohomologies on the free loop spaces of the T-dual sides. Spacetime, when viewed as the constant loops, is a submanifold of loop space. The duality that we prove on loop space restricts to the T-duality with $H$-flux on spacetime. This significantly refines the earlier work of the authors in 2015 where T-duality was established after localisation to the base space. The construction of the loop Hori map is an application of our generalization of the Bismut--Chern character in 2015, originally introduced in the loop space interpretation of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem by Atiyah--Witten and Bismut.</description>

      <title>Superstring amplitudes meet surfaceology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reformulate tree-level amplitudes in open superstring theory (type-I) in terms of stringy Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes with various kinematical shifts in the "curve-integral" formulation: while the bosonic-string amplitude with $n$ pairs of "scaffolding" scalars comes from a particularly simple shift of the Tr$(\phi^3)$ one (corresponding to $n$ length-$2$ cycles), the analogous superstring amplitude requires "correction" terms given by bosonic-string amplitudes with longer, even-length "cycles", which are also Tr$(\phi^3)$ ones at shifted kinematics dictated by the cycles; in total it is expressed as a sum of $(2n{-}3)!!$ shifted amplitudes originated from the expansion of a reduced Pfaffian. Upon taking $n$ scaffolding residues, this leads to a new formula of the $n$-gluon superstring amplitude, which is manifestly symmetric in $n{-}1$ legs, as a gauge-invariant combination of mixed bosonic string amplitudes with gluons and scalars, which come from length-$2$ cycles and longer ones respectively (the total sum is associated with the expansion a $n\times n$ symmetrical determinant); the corresponding prefactors are nested commutators of $2n$-gon kinematical variables, which nicely become traces of field-strengths for those legs corresponding to scalars in the mixed amplitudes. These interesting linear combinations of bosonic string amplitudes must guarantee the cancellation of tachyon poles and $F^3$ vertices ${\it etc.}$, and they give new relations between the superstring amplitude and its bosonic-string building blocks to all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion (the first order gives a new formula for gluon amplitudes with a single $F^3$ insertion in terms of Yang-Mills-scalar amplitudes). We provide both the worldsheet and "curve-integral" derivations, and discuss applications to heterotic and type II cases.</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich/complex-scaling regularization and rigged Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating the Zel'dovich regularization, the complex scaling method, and the rigged Hilbert space. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. Also, we find the most essential regulator of functional analyticity and construct a modified Hilbert space of the exact WKB framework for resonance, which is called the rigged Hilbert space. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Duality-symmetric D3-brane action with twisted self-dual 2-form doublet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we apply the Sen formalism, which is originally developed for chiral form fields, to construct non-linear $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ duality-symmetric actions in four dimensions. The non-linear actions contain a potential term whose allowed form satisfies a condition arising from a requirement that twisted self-duality condition of the theory is equivalent to a constitutive relation. This condition can be perturbatively solved to obtain the potential term. In special cases such as DBI theory or D3-brane, the potential term has a closed form. In particular, we construct the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ duality-symmetric D3-brane action coupled to the type IIB supergravity background in the Sen formalism Key features of the Sen formalism are also present in the duality-symmetric actions. For example, there are unphysical fields with the wrong sign of kinetic terms. These fields are uncoupled from physical fields at the equations of motion level. We show that the constructed duality-symmetric D3-brane action also has symmetries such as diffeomorphism and kappa symmetry. The action also gives required equations of motion. Hamiltonian analysis is also studied. The decoupling between physical and unphysical sectors are also shown at the Hamiltonian level.</description>

      <title>Emergence of CY Triple Intersection Numbers in M-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To give more credence to the M-theoretic Emergence Proposal it is important to show that also classical kinetic terms in a low energy effective action arise as a quantum effect from integrating out light towers of states. We show that for compactifications of type IIA on Calabi-Yau manifolds, the classical weak coupling Yukawa couplings, which are the triple intersection numbers of the Calabi-Yau threefold, can be obtained from the 1/2-BPS protected one-loop Schwinger integral over $D2$-$D0$ bound states, after employing a novel regularization for the final infinite sum of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. Approaching the problem in a consecutive manner from 6D decompactification over emergent string to the ultimate M-theory limits, we arrive at a mathematically concrete regularization that involves finite distance degeneration limits of Calabi-Yau threefolds in an intriguing way. We test and challenge this proposal by the concrete determination of the periods around such degeneration points for threefolds with one K\"ahler modulus and the two examples $\mathbb P_{1,1,1,6,9}[18]$ and $\mathbb P_{1,1,2,2,6}[12]$.</description>

      <title>On a 5D UV completion of Argyres-Douglas theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a novel UV completion of a class of Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories in the $\Omega$-background by its embedding into the renormalisation group flow from five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFT) on $S^1$. This is obtained via analysing these theories in the light of ($q$-)Painlev\'e/gauge theory correspondence, which allows to compute the five dimensional BPS partition functions as an expansion in the Wilson loop vev with integer $q$-polynomials coefficients. These are derived formulating the gauge theory on a blown-up geometry and using a five-dimensional lift of (topological) operator/state correspondence. We discuss in detail the phase diagram of the four dimensional limits, pinpointing the special AD loci. Explicit computations are reported for $\tilde E_1$ SCFT and its limit to H$_0=(A_1,A_2)$ AD theory.</description>

      <title>Free-field construction of Carrollian $W_N$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Carrollian contractions of $W_N$-algebras from a free-field perspective. Using a contraction of the Miura transformation, we obtain explicit free-field realizations of the resulting Carrollian $W_N$-algebras. At the classical level, they are isomorphic to the Galilean $W_N$-algebras. In the quantum case, we distinguish between two Carrollian constructions: a flipped Carrollian contraction, where the time direction is reversed in one sector, and a symmetric contraction. The flipped construction yields a quantum algebra isomorphic to the Galilean one, whereas the symmetric construction produces a distinct quantum Carrollian $W_N$-algebra whose basic structure constants are identical to those of the classical Carrollian $W_N$-algebra. These algebras provide a natural framework for studying extended symmetries in Carrollian conformal field theories, motivated by recent developments in flat space holography. Our construction provides tools for developing the representation theory of Carrollian (and Galilean) $W_N$-algebras using free-field techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: We construct an exact solution in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, describing multi-centered rotating black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges, obtained via dimensional reduction from five-dimensional Einstein gravity. This generalizes the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution to the rotating case, and extends the recent multi-centered rotating black hole solutions of Teo and Wan to configurations with unequal electric and magnetic charges. The resulting spacetimes are free of curvature singularities, conical defects, Dirac-Misner strings, and closed timelike curves, both on and outside the horizons, provided that the black holes have either aligned or anti-aligned spin orientations.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content gone largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian Kerr-Schild ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the Poincar\'e subalgebra containing exclusively time translations and spatial rotations. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz transition in a holographic finite density flavour brane Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a top-down holographic model of a Weyl semimetal to finite charge density and compute the fermionic spectral function by introducing two probe fermions of opposite chirality. The model is controlled by the boundary fermion mass M and the chemical potential $\mu$. In the zero density, small-M limit, we recover four energy bands, two Weyl points, and linear dispersion in their vicinity, the hallmarks of a Weyl semimetal. As M increases, the bands between the Weyl points become progressively compressed and the spectral weight associated with those bands is smeared out. At finite charge density, we map the Fermi surface in momentum space and identify a Lifshitz transition: two distinct Fermi pockets, each enclosing a different Weyl point, merge into a single large Fermi surface that encloses both. This transition can be induced by either control parameter. Varying M alters the band structure and thus the band shape, which drives the Lifshitz transition, whereas changing $\mu$ shifts the bands relative to the Fermi level without qualitatively changing the band structure, producing the Lifshitz transition by moving the band positions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After the successful full-shape analyses of BOSS data using the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure, we investigate what upcoming galaxy surveys might achieve. We introduce a ``perturbativity prior" that ensures that loop terms are as large as theoretically expected, which is effective in the case of a large number of EFT parameters. After validating our technique by comparison with already-performed analyses of BOSS data, we provide Fisher forecasts using the one-loop prediction for power spectrum and bispectrum for two benchmark surveys: DESI and MegaMapper. We find overall great improvements on the cosmological parameters. In particular, we find that MegaMapper (DESI) should obtain at least a 12$\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) evidence for non-vanishing neutrino masses, bound the curvature $\Omega_k$ to 0.0012 (0.012), and primordial inflationary non-Gaussianities as follows: $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc.}}$ to $\pm 0.26$ (3.3), $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{eq.}}$ to $\pm16$ (92), $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{orth.}}$ to $\pm 4.2$ (27). Such measurements would provide much insight on the theory of Inflation. We investigate the limiting factor of shot noise and ignorance of the EFT parameters.</description>

Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Killing (Super)Algebras Associated to Connections on Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalise the notion of a Killing superalgebra, which arises in the physics literature on supergravity, to general dimension, signature and choice of spinor module and Dirac current. We also allow for Lie algebras as well as superalgebras, capturing a set of examples previously defined using geometric Killing spinors on higher-dimensional spheres. Our definition requires a connection on a spinor bundle - provided by supersymmetry transformations in the supergravity examples and by the Killing spinor equation on the spheres - and we obtain a set of sufficient conditions on such a connection for the Killing (super)algebra to exist. We show that these Lie (super)algebras are filtered deformations of graded subalgebras of (a generalisation of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra and then study such deformations abstractly using Spencer cohomology. In the highly supersymmetric Lorentzian case, we describe the filtered subdeformations which are of the appropriate form to arise as Killing superalgebras, lay out a classification scheme for their odd-generated subalgebras and prove that, under certain technical conditions, there exist homogeneous Lorentzian spin manifolds on which these deformations are realised as Killing superalgebras. Our results generalise previous work in the 11-dimensional supergravity literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide some examples of Killing superalgebras on 2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds within the theoretical framework established in [SIGMA 21 (2025), 081, 61 pages, arXiv:2409.11306]. We compute the Spencer cohomology group $\mathsf{H}^{2,2}(\mathfrak{s}_-;\mathfrak{s})$ and filtered deformations of the non-chiral flat model (Euclidean and Poincar\'e) superalgebra $\mathfrak{s}$ for various Dirac currents and show these arise as Killing superalgebras for (imaginary) geometric Killing and skew-Killing spinors in both Riemannian and Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>Observable-projected ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Observational implications of Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observational implications of Wald--Gauss--Bonnet (WGB) topological dark energy, a modified cosmological framework derived from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture applied to the Universe's apparent horizon, with the Wald--Gauss--Bonnet entropy replacing the standard Bekenstein--Hawking one. Assuming a topological connection between the apparent horizon and interior black hole (BH) horizons, we derive modified Friedmann equations where the evolution of dark energy depends on BH formation and merger rates, which are approximated by the cosmic star formation rate. These equations introduce an additional, astrophysics--dependent contribution to the cosmological constant. We test two scenarios, one with a vanishing cosmological constant ($\Lambda = 0$) and another with a modified $\Lambda$ against late--Universe data (SNIa, BAO, Cosmic Chronometers) via a Bayesian analysis. Although the WGB framework is consistent with observations, information criteria statistically favor the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. An analysis of linear perturbations shows that the growth of cosmic structures is nearly indistinguishable from that of $\Lambda$CDM, with negligible dark energy clustering and minimal deviation in the effective Newton's constant. The standard thermal history is also preserved. In conclusion, WGB cosmology presents a phenomenologically rich alternative that connects dark energy to black hole astrophysics while remaining compatible with current cosmological data.</description>

      <title>The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by re-examining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Axionlike particle-assisted supercooling chiral phase transition in QCD: Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario to realize the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type chiral phase transition in the QCD thermal history. This scenario predicts an axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\gtrsim$ sub GeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at the mean-field approximation level. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history, to be probed by gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition in a view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological solutions for the modified gravity theory obtained from quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the geometry and matter fields. The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.</description>
