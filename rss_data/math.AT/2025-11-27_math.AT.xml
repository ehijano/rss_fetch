      <title>$\delta$-core subsampling, strong collapses and TDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a subsampling method for topological data analysis based on strong collapses of simplicial complexes. Given a point cloud and a scale parameter $\delta$, we construct a subsampling that preserves both global and local topological features while significantly reducing computational complexity of persistent homology calculations. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, showing improved persistence approximations compared to other subsampling techniques.</description>

      <title>The G-signature Theorem on Witt spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G be a compact Lie group and let X be an oriented Witt G-pseudomanifold. Using intersection cohomology it is possible to define Sign(G,X) in R(G), the G-signature of X. Let g be an element in G. Assuming that the inclusion of the fixed point set associated to g is normally non-singular, we prove a formula for Sign(g,X), the G-signature of X computed at g, thus extending to Witt G-pseudomanifolds the fundamental result proved by Atiyah, Segal and Singer on smooth compact G-manifolds. Along the way, we give a detailed study of the fixed point set of a Thom-Mather G-space X and our main result in this direction is a sufficient condition ensuring that the fixed point set associated to G is included in X in a normally non-singular manner. This latter result provides many examples where our formula applies.</description>

      <title>Twisted equivariant quasi-elliptic cohomology and M-brane charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.00554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a twisted version of quasi-elliptic cohomology. This theory can be constructed as a K-theory of a loop space. After establishing basic properties of the theory, including restriction, change-of-group and induction maps, we construct the Chern character map. And we compute the twisted quasi-elliptic cohomology theories of representation 4-spheres acted by the finite subgroups of SU(2), which, as conjectured by Sati and Schreiber, can produce good observables on M-brane charge in a Tate-elliptic enhancement of D-brane charge in twisted equivariant K-theory.</description>

      <title>Variations on the Nerve Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a locally finite cover of a simplicial complex by subcomplexes, Bj\"orner's version of the Nerve Theorem provides conditions under which the homotopy groups of the nerve agree with those of the original complex through a range of dimensions. We extend this result to covers of CW complexes by subcomplexes and to open covers of arbitrary topological spaces, without local finiteness restrictions. Moreover, we show that under somewhat weaker hypotheses, the same conclusion holds when one utilizes the multinerve introduced by Colin de Verdi\`ere, Ginot, and Goaoc. Our main tool is the \v{C}ech complex associated to a cover, as analyzed in work of Dugger and Isaksen. As applications, we prove a generalized crosscut theorem for posets and some variations on Quillen's Poset Fiber Theorem.</description>

      <title>Estimating the persistent homology of $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued functions using function-geometric multifiltrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an unknown $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued function $f$ on a metric space $X$, can we approximate the persistent homology of $f$ from a finite sampling of $X$ with known pairwise distances and function values? This question has been answered in the case $n=1$, assuming $f$ is Lipschitz continuous and $X$ is a sufficiently regular geodesic metric space, and using filtered geometric complexes with fixed scale parameter for the approximation. In this paper we answer the question for arbitrary $n$, under similar assumptions and using function-geometric multifiltrations. Our analysis offers a different view on these multifiltrations by focusing on their approximation properties rather than on their stability properties. We also leverage the multiparameter setting to provide insight into the influence of the scale parameter, whose choice is central to this type of approach. From a practical standpoint, we show that our approximation results are robust to input noise, and that function-geometric multifiltrations have good statistical convergence properties. We also provide an algorithm to compute our estimators, and we use its implementation to conduct extensive experiments, on both synthetic and real biological data, in order to validate our theoretical results and to assess the practicality of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the rational splitting of excisive endofunctors of spectra as a product of their homogeneous layers independent of rational Tate vanishing. We utilise the analogy between endofunctors of spectra and equivariant stable homotopy theory and as a consequence, we obtain an algebraic model for rational excisive functors.</description>

      <title>A Dwyer-Rezk classification for polynomial functors in Weiss calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Goodwillie calculus, unpublished work of Dwyer and Rezk provides a classification of reduced filtered colimit preserving $d$-excisive functors from pointed spaces to spectra as spectrum-valued functors on the category of finite sets of cardinality at most $d$ and epimorphisms. We prove through different methods the analogous result in Weiss calculus: $d$-polynomial functors are equivalent to spectrum-valued functors on the category of finite-dimensional inner product spaces of dimension at most $d$ and orthogonal epimorphisms. Via similar methods we obtain a new proof of the classification of homogeneous functors.</description>

      <title>Affineness and reconstruction in complex-periodic geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working in a generic derived algebro-geometric context, we lay the foundations for the general study of affineness and local descendability. When applied to $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ rings equipped with the fpqc topology, these foundations give an $\infty$-category of spectral stacks, a viable functor-of-points alternative to Lurie's approach to nonconnective spectral algebraic geometry. Specializing further to spectral stacks over the moduli stack of oriented formal groups, we use chromatic homotopy theory to obtain a large class of $0$-affine stacks, generalizing Mathew--Meier's famous $0$-affineness result. We introduce a spectral refinement of Hopkins' stack construction of an $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ ring, and study when it provides an inverse to the global sections of a spectral stack. We use this to show that a large class of stacks, which we call reconstructible, are naturally determined by their global sections, including moduli stacks of oriented formal groups of bounded height and the moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb{A}$-generators of the cohomology $H^{*}(V^{\oplus 5})=\mathbb{Z}/2[u_1,\ldots,u_5]$ and the cohomological transfer of rank 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the cohomology of the 2-primary Steenrod algebra $\mathbb{A}$ is a central problem in algebraic topology, as it forms the $E_2$-term of the Adams spectral sequence converging to the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The Singer cohomological transfer, $\varphi_n$, is a key homomorphism for characterizing this cohomology. Singer conjectured that $\varphi_n$ is always a monomorphism. The Singer transfer is closely linked to the Peterson hit problem, which seeks a minimal generating set for the $\mathbb{A}$-module $H^{*}(V^{\oplus n}) = \mathbb{Z}/2[u_1, \ldots, u_n]$, also unsolved for $n \geq 5$. In this paper, we study the hit problem for $H^{*}(V^{\oplus 5})$ and verify Singer's conjecture for the case $n=5$ in the general degree $d = 2^{t+5} + 2^{t+2} + 2^{t+1}-5$ for any non-negative integer $t$. We demonstrate that the Singer cohomological transfer is an isomorphism for $n=5$ in degree $d$. This provides a positive answer to Singer's conjecture in these specific cases. The appendix provides our new algorithm implemented on the computer algebra system OSCAR, through which all principal results of this paper have been completely verified.</description>

      <title>Matching complexes of $\bf 3 \times n$ grid graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matching complex of a graph $G$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are matchings in $G$. In the last few years the matching complexes of grid graphs have gained much attention among the topological combinatorists. In 2017, Braun and Hough obtained homological results related to the matching complexes of $2 \times n$ grid graphs. Further in 2019, Matsushita showed that the matching complexes of $2 \times n$ grid graphs are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. In this article we prove that the matching complexes of $3\times n$ grid graphs are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. We also give the comprehensive list of the dimensions of spheres appearing in the wedge.</description>

Abstract: For any geodesic metric space $X$, we give a complete cohomological characterisation of the hyperbolicity of $X$ in terms of vanishing of its second $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology. We extend this result to the relative setting of $X$ with a collection of uniformly hyperbolic subgraphs. As an application, we give a cohomological characterisation of acylindrical hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Insights into Protein Architecture: Persistent Homology and Machine Learning Applied to the Flagellar Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning approach that leverages persistent homology to classify bacterial flagellar motors into two functional states: rotated and stalled. By embedding protein structural data into a topological framework, we extract multiscale features from filtered simplicial complexes constructed over atomic coordinates. These topological invariants, specifically persistence diagrams and barcodes, capture critical geometric and connectivity patterns that correlate with motor function. The extracted features are vectorized and integrated into a machine learning pipeline that includes dimensionality reduction and supervised classification. Applied to a curated dataset of experimentally characterized flagellar motors from diverse bacterial species, our model demonstrates high classification accuracy and robustness to structural variation. This approach highlights the power of topological data analysis in revealing functionally relevant patterns beyond the reach of traditional geometric descriptors, offering a novel computational tool for protein function prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the ring structure of the torus-equivariant cohomology of rank-one juggling varieties with rational coefficients. By realizing these varieties as cyclic quiver Grassmannians, we construct a Knutson--Tao type basis for their equivariant cohomology. Using this basis, we give an explicit description of the ring structure in terms of generators and relations, and compute the corresponding structure constants. Finally, we show that these structure constants are integral.</description>
