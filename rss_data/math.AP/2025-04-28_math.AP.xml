      <title>On a Modified Mathematical Model Arising from a Trojan Y Chromosome Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a modified Trojan Y chromosome (TYC) strategy aimed at eradicating invasive species from natural habitats. The proposed mathematical model enhances the original TYC framework by ensuring the non-negativity of population densities and preventing potential solution blow-up. The new model is formulated as a strongly coupled reaction-diffusion system with distinct diffusion coefficients for each species. We first establish the global well-posedness of the system. Subsequently, a stability analysis is conducted. In particular, we demonstrate that the population densities converge to zero when the birth rate for each species falls below a critical threshold. Additionally, we prove the existence of a positive steady-state solution even as the artificially introduced YY-female population density tends to zero as $t$ tends to $\infty$. Furthermore, we identify a bifurcation in the system's solutions as the birth rate crosses the critical value.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to Strichartz estimates and gallery waves for the irrotational compressible Euler equation in a vacuum setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free boundary problem for the irrotational compressible Euler equation in a physical vacuum setting. By using the irrotationality condition in the Eulerian formulation of Ifrim and Tataru, we derive a formulation of the problem in terms of the velocity potential function, which turns out to be an acoustic wave equation that is widely used in solar seismology. This paper is a first step towards understanding what Strichartz estimates are achievable for the aforementioned equation. Our object of study is the corresponding linearized problem in a model case, in which our domain is represented by the upper half-space. For this, we investigate the geodesics corresponding to the resulting acoustic metric, which have multiple periodic reflections next to the boundary. Inspired by their dynamics, we define a class of whispering gallery type modes associated to our problem, and prove Strichartz estimates for them. By using a construction akin to a wave packet, we also prove that one necessarily has a loss of derivatives in the Strichartz estimates for the acoustic wave equation satisfied by the potential function. In particular, this suggests that the low regularity well-posedness result obtained by Ifrim and Tataru might be optimal, at least in a certain frequency regime. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for the irrotational compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum.</description>

      <title>On the gravity-capillary water waves with point vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional deep gravity-capillary water waves with point vortices. We first formulate the question in the holomorphic coordinates. Then, we derive an a priori energy estimate for water waves, and show that the water wave system has a unique solution for initial data in $\mathcal{H}^s\times \Omega_t^N$, $s&gt;\frac{3}{2}$. Finally, we show that if there are only two vortices, and vortices, initial velocity, and initial surfaces are symmetric with respect to the vertical axis, then the solution of pure capillary water waves with two point vortices has an extended cubic lifespan.</description>

We show that in dimensions $n\leq 4$, for all values of the Lagrangian phase, any $C^{1,1}$ solution is smooth and derive a $C^{k,\alpha}$ estimate for it, where $k \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic evolutions on the incompressible Navier--Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the asymptotic expansion, large-time behavior of incompressible Navier--Stokes flow in $n$ dimensional whole space is drawn. In particular, the logarithmic evolution included in flow velocity is focused. When the components of velocity are ordered from major to minor according to the parabolic scale, logarithmically evolving components appear in a certain pattern. This work asserts that this pattern varies depending on the evenness and oddness of the space dimension. In the preceding works, the expansion with $2n$th order was already derived. The assertion is derived by reexamining these works in detail.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium-diffusion limit of the radiation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We justify rigorously the equilibrium-diffusion limit of the model consists of a radiative transfer satisfied by the specific intensity of radiation coupled to a diffusion equation satisfied by the material temperature. For general initial data, we construct the existence of the solution to the coupled model in $\mathbb{T}^{3}$ by the Hilbert expansion and prove the convergence of the solutions to the limiting system in the equilibrium-diffusion regime. Moreover, the initial layer for the radiative density and the temperature are constructed to get the strong convergence in $L^\infty$ norm. We also get the convergence rates about the intensity of radiation and temperature in this paper.</description>

      <title>A nonvariational Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bounded open subset $\Omega$ of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in]0,1[$ and we solve the Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation both in $\Omega$ and in the exterior of $\Omega$. We look for solutions in the space for $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions that may not have a classical normal derivative at the boundary points of $\Omega$ and that may have an infinite Dirichlet integral around the boundary of $\Omega$. Namely for solutions that do not belong to the classical variational setting.</description>

      <title>Sharp decay estimates and numerical analysis for weakly coupled systems of two subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial-boundary value problem for weakly coupled systems of time-fractional subdiffusion equations with spatially and temporally varying coupling coefficients. By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The stability of current vortex sheets with transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to the results in \cite{Shivamoggi}, using the normal mode method, we have rigorously confirmed that a transverse magnetic field reduces the stability of the system. Specifically, a larger velocity is required for stability in the presence of a magnetic field than in its absence. More precisely, when the magnitude of the magneto-acoustic Mach number $M_{B}:=\frac{\dot{v}_1^{+}}{\bar{C}_{B}}&gt;\sqrt{2}$, we proved the well-posedness of the current vortex sheet problem for compressible MHD flows with a transverse magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we provide local $L^q$-estimates for the gradient of solutions of a class of quasilinear equations whose principal part lacks strong monotonicity.
  These estimates are used to establish uniform large-scale $L^q$-estimates for the gradient of solutions of degenerate/singular quasilinear equations with oscillating coefficients and large-scale Lipschitz estimates for solutions of non-degenerate equations.</description>

      <title>On a Cross-Diffusion System with Independent Drifts and no Self-Diffusion: The Existence of Totally Mixed Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of weak solutions for a two-species cross-diffusion system, set on the 1-dimensional flat torus, in which the evolution of each species is governed by two mechanisms. The first of these is a diffusion which acts only on the sum of the species with a logarithmic pressure law, and the second of these is a drift term, which can differ between the two species. Our main results hold under a total mixing assumption on the initial data. This assumption, which allows the presence of vacuum, requires specific regularity properties for the ratio of the initial densities of the two species. Moreover, these regularity properties are shown to be propagated over time. In proving the main existence result, we also establish the spatial BV regularity of solutions. In addition, our main results naturally extend to similar systems involving reaction terms.</description>

      <title>Absence of anomalous dissipation for vortex sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is said to present anomalous dissipation if energy dissipation due to viscosity does not vanish in the limit of small viscosity. In this article we present a proof of absence of anomalous dissipation for 2D flows on the torus, with an arbitrary non-negative measure plus an integrable function as initial vorticity and square-integrable initial velocity. Our result applies to flows with forcing and provides an explicit estimate for the dissipation at small viscosity. The proof relies on a new refinement of a classical inequality due to J. Nash.</description>

      <title>Upper and lower bounds of the value function for optimal control in the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of nonsmooth analysis in the Wasserstein space to finite-horizon optimal control problems for nonlocal continuity equations. We characterize the value function as a strict viscosity solution of the corresponding Bellman equation using the notions of $\varepsilon$-subdifferentials and $\varepsilon$-superdifferentials. The main paper's result is the fact that continuous subsolutions and supersolutions of this Bellman equation yield lower and upper bounds for the value function. These estimates rely on proximal calculus in the space of probability measures and the Moreau-Yosida regularization. Furthermore, the upper estimates provide a family of approximately optimal feedback strategies that realize the concept of proximal aiming.</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDEs with correlated, non-stationary Stratonovich noise of Dean--Kawasaki type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of the author and Gess [27] develop a robust well-posedness theory for a broad class of conservative stochastic PDEs, with both probabilistically stationary and non-stationary Stratonovich noise, and with irregular noise coefficients like the square root. However, one case left untreated by [27] is the case of SPDEs that combine conservative, non-stationary Stratonovich noise with square root-like nonlinearities. Such equations arise naturally in the fluctuating hydrodynamics of inhomogenous systems, and a new analysis is required to handle certain discontinuous coefficients appearing in their It\^o formulations. We treat the discontinuities by showing that the equation exhibits a novel regularization of the logarithm of the solution, and establish the well-posedness by building on the concept of a stochastic kinetic solution introduced in [27].</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying Riemannian structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized constraints and gauge equivariance, as demonstrated by several examples, including the linearized Einstein equations with sources, where the cohomology encodes geometric and topological data.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing Neumann and Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq\Rbb^n$ is a topic that goes back at least to the work of P\'olya \cite{polya}. We study the effect of the isoperimetric ratio of $\Omega$ on the number $N(\Omega)$ of Neumann eigenvalues that do not exceed the first Dirichlet eigenvalue, proving that $N(\Omega)$ is bounded above and below by a constant multiple of the isoperimetric ratio in the case of convex domains. We also show that these estimates do not hold in the non-convex setting, addressing questions of Cox-MacLachlan-Steeves \cite{coxetal} and Freitas \cite{freitas}. Despite these counterexamples, we find similar estimates for polygonal domains in $\Rbb^2$ as well as certain families of fiber bundles that asymptotically collapse onto their base spaces, the motivating examples being tubular neighborhoods of submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a novel nonlocal model for cell-cell adhesion via receptor binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local well-posedness is established for a highly nonlocal nonlinear diffusion-adhesion system for bounded initial values with small support. Macroscopic systems of this kind were previously obtained by the authors through upscaling in [32] and can account for the effect of microscopic receptor binding dynamics in cell-cell adhesion. The system analysed here couples an integro-PDE featuring degenerate diffusion of the porous media type and nonlocal adhesion with a novel nonlinear integral equation. The approach is based on decoupling the system and using Banach's fixed point theorem to solve each of the two equations individually and subsequently the entire system. The main challenge of the implementation lies in selecting a suitable framework. One of the key results is the local well-posedness for the integral equation with a Radon measure as a parameter. The analysis of this equation utilizes the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, marking the first application of this norm in handling a nonlinear integral equation.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of $p$-biharmonic equations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the $p$-biharmonic equation on graphs, which arises in point cloud processing and can be interpreted as a natural extension of the graph $p$-Laplacian from the perspective of hypergraph. The asymptotic behavior of the solution is investigated when the random geometric graph is considered and the number of data points goes to infinity. We show that the continuum limit is an appropriately weighted $p$-biharmonic equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The result relies on the uniform $L^p$ estimates for solutions and gradients of nonlocal and graph Poisson equations. The $L^\infty$ estimates of solutions are also obtained as a byproduct.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of axially-symmetric solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r$, $v_\varphi$, $\omega_\varphi$ vanish on the lateral boundary $\partial \Omega$ of the cylinder, and that $v_z$, $\omega_\varphi$, $\partial_z v_\varphi$ vanish on the top and bottom parts of the boundary $\partial \Omega$, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates, and we denoted by $\omega =\mathrm{curl}\, v$ the vorticity field. We use weighted estimates and $H^3$ Sobolev estimate on the modified stream function to derive three order-reduction estimates. These enable one to reduce the order of the nonlinear estimates of the equations, and help observe that the solutions to the equations are ``almost regular''. We use the order-reduction estimates to show that the solution to the equations remains regular as long as, for any $p\in (6,\infty)$, $\| v_\varphi \|_{L^\infty_t L^p_x}/\| v_\varphi \|_{L^\infty_t L^\infty_x}$ remains bounded below by a positive number.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities, log-Sobolev inequality and the stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general scale-dependent Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type identity involving a vector field on the hyperbolic space. By choosing suitable parameter, potential and vector field in this identity, we can recover, as well as derive new versions of and substantially improve several Poincar\'{e} type, Hardy type and Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type inequalities in the literature. We also investigate weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities on hyperbolic space, where the weight functions depend on a scaling parameter. This leads to a new family of scale-dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities with Gaussian type measure on the hyperbolic space which is of independent interest. As a result, we derive both scale-dependent and scale-invariant $L^{2}$-stability results for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this setting. Finally, we study the logarithmic Sobolev inequality with Gaussian measure on the hyperbolic spaces, that is still missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws with Flux Functions of Convexity Degeneracy and Global Dynamic Patterns of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with a new solution formula and its applications to the analysis of properties of entropy solutions of the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. We first introduce/validate the novel formula for entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem, which generalizes the Lax-Oleinik formula. Then, by employing this formula, we obtain a series of fine properties of entropy solutions and discover several new structures and phenomena, which include: (i) Series of results on the fine structures of entropy solutions, especially including the new criteria for all six types of initial waves for the Cauchy problem, the new structures of entropy solutions inside the backward characteristic triangle, and the new features of the formation and development of shocks such as all five types of continuous shock generation points, along with their criteria and the optimal regularities of the corresponding resulting shocks; (ii) Series of results on the global structures of entropy solutions, including the four new invariants of entropy solutions, the new criteria for the locations and speeds of divides, and the exact determination of the global structures of entropy solutions; (iii) Series of new results on the asymptotic behaviors of entropy solutions, including the asymptotic profiles and decay rates of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$, respectively in the $L^\infty$--norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$--norm. Through these results above, we obtain the global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) and general initial data in $L^\infty$. Moreover, the new solution formula is also extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Fujita-type results for the semilinear heat equations driven by mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the critical behavior of the semilinear heat equation $u_t+\mathcal{L}_{a, b}u=|u|^p+f(x)$, considering both the presence and absence of a forcing term $f(x).$ The mixed local-nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}_{a, b}=-a\Delta+b(-\Delta)^s,\,a,\,b \in \mathbb{R}_+,$ incorporates both local and nonlocal Laplacians. We determine the Fujita-type critical exponents by considering the existence or nonexistence of global solutions. Interestingly, the critical exponent is determined by the nonlocal component of the operator and, as a result, coincides with that of the fractional Laplacian.
  In the case without a forcing term, our results improve upon recent findings by Biagi et al. [Bull. London Math. Soc. 57 (2025), 265-284] and Del Pezzo et al. [Nonlinear Analysis 255 (2025), 113761]. When a forcing term is included, our results refine those of Wang et al. [J. Math. Anal. Appl., 488 (1) (2020), 124067] and complement the work of Majdoub [La Matematica, 2 (2023), 340-361].</description>

      <title>Pathwise Solvability and Bubbling in 2D Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation on a periodic 2D domain, driven by infinite-dimensional Gaussian noise in a Sobolev class. We establish strong local well-posedness in the energy space and characterize blow-up at random times in terms of energy concentration at small scales (bubbling). By iteration, we construct pathwise global weak solutions, with energy evolving as a c{\`a}dl{\`a}g process, and prove uniqueness within this class. These results offer a stochastic counterpart to the deterministic concept of Struwe solutions. The approach relies on a transformation that leads to a magnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with random gauge coefficients.</description>

      <title>Stability of neckpinch singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of neckpinch singularities. We show that if a mean curvature flow $\{M_t\}$ develops only finitely many neckpinch singularities at the first singular time, then the mean curvature flow starting at any sufficiently small perturbation of $M_0$ can also develop only neckpinch type singularities at the first singular time. We also show stability of nondegenerate neckpinch singularities in the above sense, which speaks in favor of stability of Type I singularities.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Boundary Control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Under Intermittent Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the perturbed Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation subject to intermittent sensing. We assume that we measure the state on a given spatial subdomain during certain time intervals, while we measure the state on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining time intervals. We assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains. Throughout the study, the equation's destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be unknown and possibly space dependent but bounded. As a result, adaptive boundary controllers are designed under different assumptions on the perturbation. In particular, we guarantee input-to-state stability (ISS) when an upperbound on the perturbation's size is known. Otherwise, only global uniform ultimate boundedness (GUUB) is guaranteed. In contrast, when the state is measured at every spatial point all the time (full state measurement), convergence to an arbitrarily-small neighborhood of the origin is guaranteed, even if the perturbation's maximal size is unknown. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>p and hp Spectral Element Methods for Elliptic Boundary Layer Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose p and hp least-squares spectral element methods for one-dimensional elliptic boundary layer problems. Stability estimates are derived and we design numerical schemes based on minimizing the residuals in the sense of least-squares in appropriate Sobolev norms. We prove parameter robust uniform error estimates i.e. error in the approximation is independent of the boundary layer parameter. For the p-version we prove a robust uniform convergence rate of O(sqrt(log W)/W), where W denotes the polynomial order used in approximation and for the hp-version the convergence rate is shown to be O(e^(-W/logW)). Numerical results are presented for a number of model elliptic boundary layer problems confirming the theoretical estimates and uniform convergence results for the p and hp versions.</description>

      <title>On the local stability of the elapsed-time model in terms of the transmission delay and interconnection strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elapsed-time model describes the behavior of interconnected neurons through the time since their last spike. It is an age-structured non-linear equation in which age corresponds to the elapsed time since the last discharge, and models many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions between neurons. We investigate the linearized stability of this equation by considering a discrete delay, which accounts for the possibility of a synaptic delay due to the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the rest of the ensemble. We state a stability criterion that allows to determine if a steady state is linearly stable or unstable depending on the delay and the interaction between neurons. Our approach relies on the study of the asymptotic behavior of related Volterra-type integral equations in terms of theirs Laplace transforms. The analysis is complemented with numerical simulations illustrating the change of stability of a steady state in terms of the delay and the intensity of interconnections.</description>
