      <title>Solid-State Maser with Microwatt Output Power at Moderate Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state masers are uniquely positioned to serve as ultra-low phase noise microwave sources due to their exceptionally low noise temperatures. However, their practical application has been historically limited by low output power and the need for deep cryogenic cooling. In this work, we present a novel design for a continuous-wave diamond-based maser oscillator operating at about 14.5 GHz and moderate cryogenic temperatures (about 180 K), achieving output power levels exceeding -30 dBm (1 microW). This performance represents a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous diamond or ruby-based maser oscillators.Our system integrates a high-Q (about 2460) compact metallic microwave cavity with optically pumped (111)-oriented NV-rich diamond crystals. The cavity supports efficient light coupling and thermal dissipation, enabling sustained high-power optical excitation (&gt;1 W) using cost-effective green LEDs. We demonstrate stable maser operation with good spectral quality and validate its output through both frequency- and time-domain analysis with phase noise data when operated in "free running" mode. Additionally, we provide phase noise estimations based on Leeson's model and show that, when coupled to a high-Q external resonator, such masers could approach thermally limited phase noise levels. These predictions suggest strong potential for diamond masers to outperform traditional ruby-based or similar maser systems, especially given their ability to operate at higher temperatures using rugged, He-free Stirling coolers. Despite current limitations related to frequency stability and jitter, this work establishes diamond-based masers as promising candidates for next-generation ultra-low phase noise microwave oscillators. Further engineering optimization - particularly in field stability, thermal regulation, and feedback locking - will be key to unlocking their full potential.</description>

      <title>Rhombohedral graphite junctions as a platform for continuous tuning between topologically trivial and non-trivial electronic phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the topological properties of quantum states can provide a way to protect them against disorder. However, typically, changing the topology of electronic states in a crystalline material is challenging because their nature is underpinned by chemical composition and lattice symmetry that are difficult to modify. We propose junctions between rhombohedral graphite crystals as a platform that enables smooth transition between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes distinguished by the absence or presence of topological junction states. By invoking an analogy with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the appearance of topological states is related to the symmetry of the atomic stacking at the interface between the crystals. The possibility to explore both the topological and non-topological phases is provided by sliding the crystals with respect to each other.</description>

      <title>Spin state of iron in I-42d-type Mg2SiO4 at ultra-high pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At extreme pressures of approximately 500 GPa, conditions characteristic of the deep interiors of super-Earths, the combination of NaCl-type MgO and post-perovskite-type MgSiO3 (PPv) has been reported to produce a post-PPv phase of Mg2SiO4 with an I-42d symmetry. This post-PPv (pppv) silicate is proposed as the primary mantle silicate in these massive rocky exoplanets. Understanding the fundamental properties of pppv, particularly in solid solutions with Fe2SiO4, is crucial for insights into the interior dynamics and compositions of such planets. In this study, we conduct an ab initio investigation of the properties of Fe2+-bearing pppv at pressures ranging from 400 GPa to 1 TPa. Given the localized nature of 3d-electrons in iron, we employ the LDA+Usc method alongside conventional DFT functionals to probe the electronic structure of this system. The dependence of the Hubbard parameter U on volume and spin state is carefully evaluated. Furthermore, we systematically explore the effects of pressure, temperature, and structural variations on the spin state of iron in Fe2+-bearing pppv, providing valuable data to improve mantle modeling for super-Earth-type exoplanets.</description>

      <title>How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ''path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.</description>
