      <description>arXiv:2412.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of $\theta$-Milstein methods with $\theta\ge 1$ to capture the non-negativity and the mean-reversion property of the exact solution of the CIR model is shown.
  In addition, the order of convergence and the preservation of the long-term variance is studied. These theoretical results are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Method with Low-Order Equations of Mixed Types and Two Grids in Photon Energy for Thermal Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal radiative transfer (TRT) is an essential piece of physics in inertial confinement fusion, high-energy density physics, astrophysics etc. The physical models of this type of problem are defined by strongly coupled differential equations describing multiphysics phenomena. This paper presents a new nonlinear multilevel iterative method with two photon energy grids for solving the multigroup radiative transfer equation (RTE) coupled with the material energy balance equation (MEB). The multilevel system of equations of the method is formulated by means of a nonlinear projection approach. The RTE is projected over elements of phase space to derive the low-order equations of different types. The hierarchy of equations consists of (1) multigroup weighted flux equations which can be interpreted as the multigroup RTE averaged over subintervals of angular range and (2) the effective grey (one-group) equations which are spectrum averaged low-order quasidiffusion (aka variable Eddington factor) equations. The system of RTE, low-order and MEB equations is approximated by the fully implicit Euler time-integration method in which absorption coefficient and emission term are evaluated at the current time step. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate convergence of a multilevel iteration algorithm in the Fleck-Cummings test problem with Marshak wave solved with large number of photon energy groups.</description>

      <title>A parsimonious approach to $C^2$ cubic splines on arbitrary triangulations: Reduced macro-elements on the cubic Wang-Shi split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method to obtain interesting subspaces of the $C^2$ cubic spline space defined on the cubic Wang-Shi refinement of a given arbitrary triangulation $\mathcal{T}$. These subspaces are characterized by specific Hermite degrees of freedom associated with only the vertices and edges of $\mathcal{T}$, or even only the vertices of $\mathcal{T}$. Each subspace still contains cubic polynomials while saving a consistent number of degrees of freedom compared with the full space. The dimension of the considered subspaces can be as small as six times the number of vertices of $\mathcal{T}$. The method fits in the setting of macro-elements: any function of such a subspace can be constructed on each triangle of $\mathcal{T}$ separately by specifying the necessary Hermite degrees of freedom. The explicit local representation in terms of a local simplex spline basis is also provided. This simplex spline basis intrinsically takes care of the complex geometry of the Wang-Shi split, making it transparent to the user.</description>

      <title>A positivity preserving second-order scheme for multi-dimensional system of non-local conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local systems of conservation laws play a crucial role in modeling flow mechanisms across various scenarios. The well-posedness of such problems is typically established by demonstrating the convergence of robust first-order schemes. However, achieving more accurate solutions necessitates the development of higher-order schemes. In this article, we present a fully discrete, second-order scheme for a general class of non-local conservation law systems in multiple spatial dimensions. The method employs a MUSCL-type spatial reconstruction coupled with Runge-Kutta time integration. The proposed scheme is proven to preserve positivity in all the unknowns and exhibits L-infinity stability. Numerical experiments conducted on both the non-local scalar and system cases illustrate the8 importance of second-order scheme when compared to its first-order counterpart.</description>

      <title>On computing local monodromy and the numerical local irreducible decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similarly to the global case, the local structure of a holomorphic subvariety at a given point is described by its local irreducible decomposition. Following the paradigm of numerical algebraic geometry, an algebraic subvariety at a point is represented by a numerical local irreducible decomposition comprised of a local witness set for each local irreducible component. The key requirement for obtaining a numerical local irreducible decomposition is to compute the local monodromy action of a generic linear projection at the given point, which is always well-defined on any small enough neighborhood. We characterize some of the behavior of local monodromy action of linear projection maps under analytic continuation, allowing computations to be performed beyond a local neighborhood. With this characterization, we present an algorithm to compute the local monodromy action and corresponding numerical local irreducible decomposition for algebraic varieties. The results are illustrated using several examples facilitated by an implementation in an open source software package.</description>

      <title>Shifted Composition III: Local Error Framework for KL Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling arguments are a central tool for bounding the deviation between two stochastic processes, but traditionally have been limited to Wasserstein metrics. In this paper, we apply the shifted composition rule--an information-theoretic principle introduced in our earlier work--in order to adapt coupling arguments to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Our framework combine the strengths of two previously disparate approaches: local error analysis and Girsanov's theorem. Akin to the former, it yields tight bounds by incorporating the so-called weak error, and is user-friendly in that it only requires easily verified local assumptions; and akin to the latter, it yields KL divergence guarantees and applies beyond Wasserstein contractivity.
  We apply this framework to the problem of sampling from a target distribution $\pi$. Here, the two stochastic processes are the Langevin diffusion and an algorithmic discretization thereof. Our framework provides a unified analysis when $\pi$ is assumed to be strongly log-concave (SLC), weakly log-concave (WLC), or to satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality (LSI). Among other results, this yields KL guarantees for the randomized midpoint discretization of the Langevin diffusion. Notably, our result: (1) yields the optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt d/\epsilon)$ rate in the SLC and LSI settings; (2) is the first result to hold beyond the 2-Wasserstein metric in the SLC setting; and (3) is the first result to hold in \emph{any} metric in the WLC and LSI settings.</description>

      <title>Unified Stochastic Framework for Neural Network Quantization and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish weak convergence rates for spectral Galerkin approximations of the stochastic viscous Burgers equation driven by additive trace-class noise. Our results complement the known results regarding strong convergence; we obtain essential weak convergence rate 2. As expected, this is twice the known strong rate. The main ingredients of the proof are novel regularity results on the solutions of the associated Kolmogorov equations.</description>

Abstract: We present new convergence estimates of generalized empirical interpolation methods in terms of the entropy numbers of the parametrized function class. Our analysis is transparent and leads to sharper convergence rates than the classical analysis via the Kolmogorov n-width. In addition, we also derive novel entropy-based convergence estimates of the Chebyshev greedy algorithm for sparse n-term nonlinear approximation of a target function. This also improves classical convergence analysis when corresponding entropy numbers decay fast enough.</description>

      <title>On Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz for Linear Systems with Time-Varying Noise and Corruption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale systems of linear equations arise in machine learning, medical imaging, sensor networks, and in many areas of data science. When the scale of the systems are extreme, it is common for a fraction of the data or measurements to be corrupted. The Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz (QRK) method is known to converge on large-scale systems of linear equations $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ that are inconsistent due to static corruptions in the measurement vector $\mathbf{b}$. We prove that QRK converges even for systems corrupted by time-varying perturbations. Additionally, we prove that QRK converges up to a convergence horizon on systems affected by time-varying noise and corruption. Finally, we utilize Markov's inequality to prove a lower bound on the probability that the largest entries of the QRK residual reveal the time-varying corruption in each iteration. We present numerical experiments which illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the Numerical Approximation of the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve Expansion for Random Fields with Random Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications, random fields reflect uncertain parameters, and often their moments are part of the modeling process and thus well known. However, there are practical situations where this is simply not the case. Therefore, we do not assume that we know moments or expansion terms of the random fields, but only have discretized samples of them. The main contribution of this paper concerns the approximation of the true covariance operator from these finite measurements. We derive explicit error estimates that include the finite-rank approximation error of the covariance operator, the Monte Carlo-type error for sampling in the stochastic domain, and the numerical discretization error in the physical domain. For this purpose, we use modern tapering covariance estimators adapted to high-dimensional applications, where the dimension is introduced by the resolution of the measurement process. This allows us to give sufficient conditions on the three discretization parameters to guarantee that the error is kept below a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation heat transfer in a graded-index medium often suffers accuracy problems due to the gradual changes in the refractive index. The finite element method, meshfree, and other numerical methods often struggle to maintain accuracy when applied to this medium. To address this issue, we apply physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based machine learning algorithms to simulate forward and inverse problems for this medium. We also provide the theoretical upper bounds. This theoretical framework is validated through numerical experiments of predefined and newly developed models that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the algorithms in solving radiation transport problems in the medium. The simulations show that the novel algorithm goes on with numerical stability and effectively mitigates oscillatory errors, even in cases with more pronounced variations in the refractive index.</description>

      <title>The Numerical Stability of Hyperbolic Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the exponential growth of the volume of the ball w.r.t. its radius, the hyperbolic space is capable of embedding trees with arbitrarily small distortion and hence has received wide attention for representing hierarchical datasets. However, this exponential growth property comes at a price of numerical instability such that training hyperbolic learning models will sometimes lead to catastrophic NaN problems, encountering unrepresentable values in floating point arithmetic. In this work, we carefully analyze the limitation of two popular models for the hyperbolic space, namely, the Poincar\'e ball and the Lorentz model. We first show that, under the 64 bit arithmetic system, the Poincar\'e ball has a relatively larger capacity than the Lorentz model for correctly representing points. Then, we theoretically validate the superiority of the Lorentz model over the Poincar\'e ball from the perspective of optimization. Given the numerical limitations of both models, we identify one Euclidean parametrization of the hyperbolic space which can alleviate these limitations. We further extend this Euclidean parametrization to hyperbolic hyperplanes and exhibits its ability in improving the performance of hyperbolic SVM.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretiza-tion method for simulating the radiative transport equation. However, the ray effect is a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests that exhibit the ray effect, we observe low regularity in the velocity variable of the solution. To address this issue, we propose a Random Ordinate Method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared to other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) the computational cost is comparable to that of DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing DOM-based code; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. A formal analysis is presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias. Numerical tests demonstrate the reduction in computational cost compared toDOM, as well as its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Dynamic Models Hybridisation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-based dynamic models (PBDMs) are simplified representations of complex dynamical systems. PBDMs take specific processes within a complex system and assign a fragment of variables and an accompanying set of parameters to depict the processes. As this often leads to suboptimal parameterisation of the system, a key challenge requires refining the empirical parameters and variables to reduce uncertainties while maintaining the model s explainability and enhancing its predictive accuracy. We demonstrate that a hybrid mosquito population dynamics model, which integrates a PBDM with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), retains the explainability of the PBDM by incorporating the PINN-learned model parameters in place of its empirical counterparts. Specifically, we address the limitations of traditional PBDMs by modelling the parameters of larva and pupa development rates using a PINN that encodes complex, learned interactions of air temperature, precipitation and humidity. Our results demonstrate improved mosquito population simulations including the difficult-to-predict mosquito population peaks. This opens the possibility of hybridisation concept application on other complex systems based on PBDMs such as cancer growth to address the challenges posed by scarce and noisy data, and to numerical weather prediction and climate modelling to overcome the gap between physics-based and data-driven weather prediction models.</description>
