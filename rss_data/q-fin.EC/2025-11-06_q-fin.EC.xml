      <title>Extreme events and public debt dynamics: Lessons from Croatia's experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Croatian data and the IMF's Natural Disaster Debt Dynamic Tool, this paper assesses how public debt adjusts to extreme events in a small open economy. We compare debt paths under baseline and stress scenarios, the latter simulating a major earthquake in 2025. Croatia provides a unique setting for evaluating post-disaster recovery in countries recently incorporated into the European Union. Our benchmark projections, which assume moderate economic growth and a broadly neutral fiscal stance, suggest the debt-to-GDP ratio will gradually decline to below 55% by 2040. In contrast, in the disaster scenario, we document a sharp short-term increase and a persistent upward shift in the debt trajectory, reaching 75% of GDP. Deterministic and stochastic simulations allow us to assess the distribution of potential outcomes. It is shown that, in the absence of shocks, public debt is on a sustainable downward path, but a severe natural disaster could reverse this trend and keep it elevated for years. Our findings highlight the importance of fiscal buffers that are critical for creating space to absorb shocks. The paper innovates by integrating natural disaster stress-testing into public debt analysis, with implications for fiscal risk management and policy planning. While we focus on Croatia, the mechanisms we uncover have broader implications for small open economies exposed to extreme events.</description>

      <title>A Computer Vision Based Proxy for Political Polarization in Religious Countries: A Turkiye Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a novel proxy for political polarization, initially proposed by Caliskan et al., which estimates intergroup distances using computer vision. Analyzing 1,400+ YouTube videos with advanced object detection, their study quantifies demographic and religious divides in Turkiye, a deeply polarized nation. Our findings reveal strong correlations between intergroup distances and electoral polarization, measured via entropy-based voting metrics weighted by religiosity and political inclination. Two key insights emerge: (1) Greater distances between religious and nonreligious individuals (NRP vs RP) heighten electoral entropy, underscoring sociocultural fragmentation. (2) Intragroup diversity among nonreligious individuals (NRP vs NRP) stabilizes polarization, aligning with Axelrod's cultural dissemination model. This research advances computational social science and economics by showing that physical distancing serves as a scalable proxy for polarization, complementing traditional economic indicators.</description>

      <title>Gender gap in the desired wages: Evidence from large administrative data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the gender gap in desired wages using large administrative data of public job referrals, which allows us to look at the desired salaries of individuals from a wider wage distribution. We conduct a decomposition analysis using available information on age, desired work region, and desired occupation. We find that of the three factors, desired occupation is the most important in generating differences in desired wages; however, the residuals are the largest outside of the three factors. To further probe the unexplained residuals, we also conduct heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses using the available data.</description>

      <title>Duration Dependence and Job Search over the Spell: Evidence from Job Seeker Activity Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how job search behavior evolves over the unemployment spell and the extent to which job seekers experience duration dependence in callbacks. Leveraging data on 2.4 million monthly activity reports containing detailed information on job applications, interviews, and other search activities, we separate within-spell changes from dynamic selection with a time-and-spell fixed effects design. We find that raw search effort increases with unemployment duration, but this pattern reflects dynamic selection: within-spell search effort remains flat and declines sharply in the months preceding re-employment. Around unemployment insurance (UI) exhaustion, search effort drops by approximately 10%, likely due to participation in labor market programs crowding out job search. Reported interviews indicate that callbacks decline by 6% per month, but only 10--14% of this decline reflects ``true'' duration dependence. Finally, we document substantial heterogeneity: search effort and duration dependence vary strongly by age, and job seekers in tight labor markets experience about 50% more duration dependence.</description>

      <title>Defining the payback period for nonconventional cash flows: an axiomatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The payback period is unambiguously defined for conventional investment projects, projects in which a series of cash outflows is followed by a series of cash inflows. Its definition for nonconventional projects is more challenging, since their balances (cumulative cash flow streams) may have multiple break-even points. Academics and practitioners offer a few contradictory recipes to manage this issue, suggesting to use the first break-even point of the balance, the last break-even point of the balance, or the break-even point of the modified cumulative cash flow stream, representing the moment of time in which the cumulative cash inflow exceeds the total cash outflow. In this note, we show that the last break-even point of the project balance is the only definition of the payback period consistent with a set of economically meaningful axioms. An analogous result is established for the discounted payback period.</description>

      <title>Supply Chain Disruptions, the Structure of Production Networks, and the Impact of Globalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a parsimonious multi-sector model of international production and use it to study the impact of a disruption in the production of some goods propagates to other goods and consumers, and how that impact depends on the goods' positions in, and overall structure of, the production network. We show that the short-run impact of a disruption can be dramatically larger than the long-run impact. The short-run disruption depends on the value of all of the final goods whose supply chains involve a disrupted good, while by contrast the long-run disruption depends only on the cost of the disrupted goods. We use the model to show how increased complexity of supply chains leads to increased fragility in terms of the probability and expected short-run size of a disruption. We also show how decreased transportation costs can lead to increased specialization in production, lowering the chances for disruption but increasing the impact conditional upon disruption. We use the model to characterize the power that a country has over others via diversions of its production as well as quotas on imports and exports.</description>

      <title>Google's Hidden Empire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents striking new data about the scale of Google's involvement in the global digital and corporate landscape, head and shoulders above the other big tech firms. While public attention and some antitrust scrutiny has focused on these firms' mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activities, Google has also been amassing an empire of more than 6,000 companies which it has acquired, supported or invested in, across the digital economy and beyond. The power of Google over the digital markets infrastructure and dynamics is likely greater than previously documented. We also trace the antitrust failures that have led to this state of affairs. In particular, we explore the role of neoclassical economics practiced both inside the regulatory authorities and by consultants on the outside. Their unduly narrow approach has obscured harms from vertical and conglomerate concentrations of market power and erected ever higher hurdles for enforcement action, as we demonstrate using examples of the failure to intervene in the Google/DoubleClick and Google/Fitbit mergers. Our lessons from the past failures can inform the current approach towards one of the biggest ever big tech M&amp;A deals: Google's $32 billion acquisition of the Israeli cloud cybersecurity firm Wiz.</description>

      <title>Effective and Scalable Programs to Facilitate Labor Market Transitions for Women in Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09968v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Women remain underrepresented in technology despite many support programs, partly due to limited evidence on which interventions work and how to allocate scarce program slots. We evaluate two approaches to facilitating technology-sector transitions for women in Poland: Challenges, a scalable and cheap-to-operate ($15/person) online program developing job-relevant portfolios (designed and implemented during this research), and one-on-one mentoring. The programs address distinct labor market barriers: expanding professional networks and teaching their effective use (Mentoring) versus providing credible skill signals (Challenges). Randomizing oversubscribed admissions, we find both programs substantially increase technology employment twelve months post-completion, Mentoring by 15 percentage points (p.p.) and Challenges by 11 p.p. Exploiting treatment effect heterogeneity, we show that algorithmic targeting based on predicted treatment effects achieves outcomes 86% larger than random assignment at current capacity levels. While mentors successfully identify high-benefit candidates (outcomes 48% above random selection), algorithmic allocation using observable characteristics yields an additional 11% improvement. The results demonstrate that (i) relatively low-cost interventions can meaningfully address gender gaps in technology, and (ii) data-driven allocation rules can substantially enhance program effectiveness even when expert judgment performs well.</description>

      <title>Meritocracy and Its Discontents: Long-run Effects of Repeated School Admission Reforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04429v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What happens if selective colleges change their admission policies? We study this question by analyzing the world's first implementation of nationally centralized meritocratic admissions in the early twentieth century. We find a persistent meritocracy-equity tradeoff. Compared to the decentralized system, the centralized system admitted more high-achievers and produced more occupational elites (such as top income earners) decades later in the labor market. This gain came at a distributional cost, however. Meritocratic centralization also increased the number of urban-born elites relative to rural-born ones, undermining equal access to higher education and career advancement.</description>

      <title>The Value of Non-Traditional Credentials in the Labor Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Workers without formal credentials experience substantially lower employment rates than their credentialed counterparts, but the extent to which information frictions contribute to these disparities remains unclear. We conducted a randomized experiment with over 800,000 online certificate earners from developing countries who lack college degrees, encouraging credential sharing on LinkedIn through reduced friction and reminders. We study credential visibility for the full sample and track employment outcomes for 40,000 learners. The intervention increased new employment by 6% (1.0 percentage point), with larger effects of 9% (1.2 percentage points) for jobs related to certificates. Treatment effects concentrate among learners with weak baseline employability: those in the bottom tercile experience employment gains of 12% while those in the top tercile see negligible effects. Those most responsive to the intervention benefit most from sharing, with a local average treatment effect of 11 percentage points for compliers. Counterfactual resume scoring shows that credentials improve perceived candidate quality by 8.5 points on average (on a scale from 1 to 100), with effects of 15-20 points for weak resumes but near-zero for strong resumes. Our findings demonstrate that information frictions substantially constrain employment for workers without traditional credentials, and that minimal-cost interventions targeting credential visibility can generate employment gains comparable to intensive training programs.</description>

      <title>The labour and resource use requirements of a good life for all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use multi-regional input-output analysis to calculate the paid labour, energy, emissions, and material use required to provide basic needs for all people. We calculate two different low-consumption scenarios, using the UK as a case study: (1) a "decent living" scenario, which includes only the bare necessities, and (2) a "good life" scenario, based on the minimum living standards demanded by UK residents. We compare the resulting footprints to the current footprint of the UK, and to the footprints of the US, China, India, and a global average. Labour footprints are disaggregated by sector, skill level, and region of origin.
  We find that neither low-consumption scenario provides a realistic path to providing a good life for all. While the decent living scenario would require only an 18-hour working week, and on a per capita basis, 35 GJ of energy use, 4.0 tonnes of emissions, and 5.5 tonnes of materials per year, it fails to provide essential needs. The good life scenario encompasses these needs, but would require a 46-hour working week, 73 GJ of energy use, 7.5 tonnes of emissions, and 13.2 tonnes of materials per capita. Both scenarios represent substantial reductions from the UK's current labour footprint of 65 hours per week, which the UK is only able to sustain by importing a substantial portion of its labour from other countries. We conclude that limiting consumption to the level of basic needs is not enough to achieve sustainability. Substantial changes to provisioning systems are also required.</description>

Abstract: The preparedness and readiness of Europe is currently being challenged not only by Russia, but since recently also by its long-standing allies. In response to the evolving external security environment, the EU's White Paper on European Defence Readiness 2030 outlines the key defence issues in Europe - including critical capability gaps of forces, challenges of the defence industry such as fragmented defence market and military mobility. Leveraging an empirically validated general equilibrium multi-sector model with ambiguity and risk, this study assesses how prepared is Europe to address protracted conflicts and systemic shocks. Exploring what strategies could enhance European readiness, scenario analysis of a hypothetical total trade war imply that today's existing problems will only be amplified by systemic shocks, if not addressed timely and in a targeted way.</description>

      <title>Environmental impacts and monetary costs of healthy diets worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using real-world food price and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for locally available food items in 171 countries, we measure how healthy diets could be obtained with the lowest possible emissions, compared to costs and emissions of the least expensive options and foods most commonly consumed. We find that foods with the lowest GHG emissions for a healthy diet would emit 0.67 kg CO2e. A healthy diet using the least expensive items in each country would emit 1.65 kg CO2e and cost 9.96. Ninety-one percent of the difference in emissions between the lowest-cost and lowest-emissions diets is driven by animal-source foods and starchy staples. Other food groups, especially fruits and vegetables, vary widely in cost but not in emissions. Results show how changes in food policy and choice can most cost-effectively support healthier and more sustainable diets worldwide.</description>

      <title>Novelty and Impact of Economics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework that recasts scientific novelty not as a single attribute of a paper, but as a reflection of its position within the evolving intellectual landscape. We decompose this position into two orthogonal dimensions: \textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual distinctiveness from its neighbors, and \textit{temporal novelty}, which captures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize these concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation metrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature. Applying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a fundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different outcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial novelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a typology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with distinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty can be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms, reflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally distinct consequences for scientific progress.</description>
