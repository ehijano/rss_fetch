      <title>On the boundedness of solutions of a forced discontinuous oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global boundedness of the solutions of a non-smooth forced oscillator with a periodic and real analytic forcing. We show that the impact map associated with this discontinuous equation becomes a real analytic and exact symplectic map when written in suitable canonical coordinates. By an accurate study of the behaviour of the map for large amplitudes and by employing a parametrization KAM theorem, we show that the periodic solutions of the unperturbed oscillator persist as two-dimensional tori under conditions that depend on the Diophantine conditions of the frequency, but are independent on both the amplitude of the orbit and of the specific value of the frequency. This allows the construction of a sequence of nested invariant tori of increasing amplitude that confine the solutions within them, ensuring their boundedness. The same construction may be useful to address such persistence problem for a larger class of non-smooth forced oscillators.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of core entropy for non-recurrent quadratic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that core entropy is H\"older continuous as a function of external angles for a large class of quadratic polynomials that are non-recurrent with respect to angle-doubling. The result follows from a symbolic analysis of the Mandelbrot set and the dynamics of Hubbard trees in terms of kneading sequences which has been established in previous work.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Proofs of Existence of Invariant Tori in Quasi-periodic Systems via Fourier Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a methodology to prove existence of (fiberwise hyperbolic) real-analytic invariant tori in real-analytic quasi-periodic skew-product dynamical systems that present nearly-invariant tori of the same characteristics. The methodology is based on the application of a Newton-Kantorovich theorem whose hypotheses are tested using Fourier analysis methods for a numerical approximation of the parameterization of an invariant torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Bowen's formula for the Julia set of a non-elementary, expanding, irreducible and aperiodic rational graph-directed Markov system satisfying the backward separating condition. Towards this end, we shall prove that the associated skew product map is topologically exact on the skew product Julia set, and satisfies the density of repelling periodic points. Moreover, we give a criterion for expandingness in terms of hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Universal bounds on the entropy of toroidal attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A toroidal set is a compactum $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ which has a neighbourhood basis of solid tori. We study the topological entropy of toroidal attractors $K$, bounding it from below in terms of purely topological properties of $K$. In particular, we show that for a toroidal set $K$, either any smooth attracting dynamics on $K$ has an entropy at least $\log 2$, or (up to continuation) $K$ admits smooth attracting dynamics which are stationary (hence with a zero entropy).</description>

      <title>Using an invariant knot of a flow to find additional invariant structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a continuous flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or any orientable $3$-manifold. Let $(Q_1, Q_0)$ be an index pair in the sense of Conley and consider the region $N := \overline{Q_1 - Q_0}$. (An example of this is a compact $3$-manifold $N$ such that trajectories of the flow cross $\partial N$ inwards or outwards transversally, or bounce off it from the outside). Suppose we know there is an invariant knot or link $K$ in the interior of $N$. We prove the following: if $K$ is contractible and nontrivial (in the sense of knot theory) in $N$, then every neighbourhood $U$ of $K$ contains a point $p \in N - K$ such that the whole trajectory of $p$ is contained in $N$. In other words, the presence of $K$ forces the existence of additional invariant structure in $N$ (besides $K$), and the latter can actually be found arbitrarily close to $K$.
  To prove this result we develop a ``coloured'' handle theory which may be of independent interest to study flows in $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$-error bounds for approximations of the Koopman operator by kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by defining data-based observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A dynamical interpretation of the connection map of an attractor-repeller decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Conley index theory one may study an invariant set $S$ by decomposing it into an attractor $A$, a repeller $R$, and the orbits connecting the two. The Conley indices of $S$, $A$ and $R$ fit into an exact sequence where a certain connection homomorphism $\Gamma$ plays an important role. In this paper we provide a dynamical interpretation of this map. Roughly, $R$ "emits" an element of its Conley index as a "wavefront", part of which intersects the connecting orbits in $S$. This subset of the wavefront evolves towards $A$ and is then "received" by it to produce an element in its Conley index.</description>

      <title>Deep polytopic autoencoders for low-dimensional linear parameter-varying approximations and nonlinear feedback design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-dimensional parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it outperforms standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems and how the particular architecture enables higher order series expansions at little extra computational effort. We illustrate the properties and potentials of this approach to computational nonlinear controller design for large-scale systems with a thorough numerical study.</description>

      <title>Incentive Designs for Learning Agents to Stabilize Coupled Exogenous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a large population of learning agents noncooperatively selecting strategies from a common set, influencing the dynamics of an exogenous system (ES) we seek to stabilize at a desired equilibrium. Our approach is to design a dynamic payoff mechanism capable of shaping the population's strategy profile, thus affecting the ES's state, by offering incentives for specific strategies within budget limits. Employing system-theoretic passivity concepts, we establish conditions under which a payoff mechanism can be systematically constructed to ensure the global asymptotic stabilization of the ES's equilibrium. In comparison to previous approaches originally studied in the context of the so-called epidemic population games, the method proposed here allows for more realistic epidemic models and other types of ES, such as predator-prey dynamics. Stabilization is established with the support of a Lyapunov function, which provides useful bounds on the transients.</description>

      <title>Compression of the Koopman matrix for nonlinear physical models via hierarchical clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods allow the prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems from data alone. The Koopman operator is one of them, which enables us to employ linear analysis for nonlinear dynamical systems. The linear characteristics of the Koopman operator are hopeful to understand the nonlinear dynamics and perform rapid predictions. The extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is one of the methods to approximate the Koopman operator as a finite-dimensional matrix. In this work, we propose a method to compress the Koopman matrix using hierarchical clustering. Numerical demonstrations for the cart-pole model and comparisons with the conventional singular value decomposition (SVD) are shown; the results indicate that the hierarchical clustering performs better than the naive SVD compressions.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of the contactomorphism group of finite regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given coorientable contact manifold $(M^{2n+1},\xi)$, we consider the group $ \operatorname{Cont}_c^{(r,\delta)}(M,\alpha)$ consisting of $C^{r,\delta}$ contactomorphisms with compact support which is equipped with $C^{r,\delta}$-topology of H\"older regularity $(r,\delta)$ for $r \geq 1$ and $0 &lt;\delta \leq 1$. We prove that for all H\"older class exponents with $r &gt; n + 2$ or $r = n+1, \, \frac12 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ (resp. $r &lt; n+1$ or $r = n+1$ and $ 0&lt; \delta &lt;\frac12$), the group is a perfect (and so a simple) group. In particular, $\operatorname{Cont}_c^r(M,\xi)$ is simple for all integer $r \geq 1$. For the case of $\operatorname{Cont}_c^{(r,\delta)}(M,\alpha)$ of general H\"older regularity, we prove the simplicity for all pairs $(r,\delta)$ leaving only the case of $(r,\delta) = (n+1,\frac12)$ open.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs of existence and stability of solitary waves in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves (solitons) in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of a stable soliton in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following parabolic-parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics,
  \begin{equation} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi_1 \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{w} \nabla w)+u(a_1-b_1u-c_1v) ,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr v_t=\Delta v-\chi_2 \nabla\cdot (\frac{v}{w} \nabla w)+v(a_2-b_2v-c_2u),\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr 0=\Delta w-\mu w +\nu u+ \lambda v,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial w}{\partial n}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain, and $\chi_i$, $a_i$, $b_i$, $ c_i$ ($i=1,2$) and $\mu,\, \nu, \, \lambda$ are positive constants. This is the first work on two-species chemotaxis-competition system with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics. Among others, we prove that for any given nonnegative initial data $u_0,v_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0+v_0\not \equiv 0$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution $(u(t,x;u_0,v_0),v(t,x;u_0,v_0),w(t,x;u_0,v_0))$ with $u(0,x;u_0,v_0)=u_0(x)$ and $v(0,x;u_0,v_0)=v_0(x)$ provided that $\min\{a_1,a_2\}$ is large relative to $\chi_1,\chi_2$ and $u_0+v_0$ is not small. Moreover, under the same condition, we prove that \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{t\to\infty} \|u(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)+v(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)\|_\infty\le M^*, \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*}
  \liminf_{t\to\infty} \inf_{x\in\Omega}(u(t,x,u_0,v_0)+v(t,x;u_0,v_0))\ge m^*, \end{equation*} for some positive constants $M^*,m^*$ independent of $u_0,v_0$, the latter is referred to as combined pointwise persistence.</description>

      <title>Follower Agnostic Methods for Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to solve online Stackelberg games, featuring multiple followers, in a follower-agnostic manner. Unlike previous works, our approach works even when leader has no knowledge about the followers' utility functions or strategy space. Our algorithm introduces a unique gradient estimator, leveraging specially designed strategies to probe followers. In a departure from traditional assumptions of optimal play, we model followers' responses using a convergent adaptation rule, allowing for realistic and dynamic interactions. The leader constructs the gradient estimator solely based on observations of followers' actions. We provide both non-asymptotic convergence rates to stationary points of the leader's objective and demonstrate asymptotic convergence to a \emph{local Stackelberg equilibrium}. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we use this algorithm to solve the problem of incentive design on a large-scale transportation network, showcasing its robustness even when the leader lacks access to followers' demand.</description>
