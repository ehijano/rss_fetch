      <title>Invertibility preservers of finitary incidence algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an arbitrary poset and $K$ an arbitrary field. We describe linear unital invertibility preservers of the finitary incidence algebra $FI(X,K)$ in terms of certain maps of the power set algebra $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and linear maps $FI(X,K)\to J(FI(X,K))$.</description>

      <title>Classification of Boolean Algebras through von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}-$Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a "von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring", which is a model for a specific equational theory. We delve into the characteristics of these rings and demonstrate that each Boolean space can be effectively represented as the image of a von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring through a specific functor. Additionally, we establish that every homomorphism between Boolean algebras can be expressed through a $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring homomorphism between von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-rings.</description>

      <title>Costability of Comodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the {\em stabilization} of the infinity category of $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>

      <title>Towards a General Theory of Dependent Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce dependent adders. A dependent adder $A$ has for every $x \in A$ a way of adding together $x$ many elements of $A$. We provide examples from many disparate branches of mathematics. Examples include the field with one element $\mathbb{F}_1$, the real numbers with integrals as sums, the category of categories with oplax colimits as sums. We also consider modules over dependent adders and provide examples.</description>

      <title>Entropies of Serre functors for higher hereditary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a higher hereditary algebra, we calculate its upper (lower) Serre dimension, the entropy and polynomial entropy of Serre functor, and the Hochschild (co)homology entropy of Serre quasi-functor. These invariants are given by its Calabi-Yau dimension for a higher representation-finite algebra, and by its global dimension and the spectral radius and polynomial growth rate of its Coxeter matrix for a higher representation-infinite algebra. For this, we prove the Yomdin type inequality on Hochschild homology entropy for a finite dimensional elementary algebra of finite global dimension. Our calculations imply that the Kikuta and Ouchi's question on relations between entropy and Hochschild (co)homology entropy has positive answer, and the Gromov-Yomdin type equalities on entropy and Hochschild (co)homology entropy hold, for the Serre functor on perfect derived category and the Serre quasi-functor on perfect dg module category of an indecomposable elementary higher hereditary algebra.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>

      <title>Quantum group deformations and quantum $ R $-(co)matrices vs. Quantum Duality Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the effect on quantum groups -- namely, both QUEA's and QFSHA's -- of deformations by twist and by 2-cocycles, showing how such deformations affect the semiclassical limit. As a second, more important task, we discuss how these deformation procedures can be "stretched" to a new extent, via a formal variation of the original recipes, using "quasi-twists" and "quasi-2-cocycles". These recipes seemingly should make no sense at all, yet we prove that they actually work, thus providing well-defined, more general deformation procedures. Later on, we explain the underlying reason that motivates such a result in light of the "Quantum Duality Principle", through which every "quasi-twist/2-cocycle" for a given quantum group can be seen as a standard twist/2-cocycle for another quantum group, associated to the original one via the appropriate Drinfeld functor. As a third task, we consider standard constructions involving $R$-(co)matrices in the general theory of Hopf algebras. First we adapt them to quantum groups, then we show that they extend to the case of "quasi-$R$-(co)matrices", and finally we discuss how these constructions interact with the Quantum Duality Principle. As a byproduct, this yields new special symmetries (isomorphisms) for the underlying pair of dual Poisson (formal) groups that one gets by specialization.</description>
