      <title>SceneSmith: Agentic Generation of Simulation-Ready Indoor Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation has become a key tool for training and evaluating home robots at scale, yet existing environments fail to capture the diversity and physical complexity of real indoor spaces. Current scene synthesis methods produce sparsely furnished rooms that lack the dense clutter, articulated furniture, and physical properties essential for robotic manipulation. We introduce SceneSmith, a hierarchical agentic framework that generates simulation-ready indoor environments from natural language prompts. SceneSmith constructs scenes through successive stages$\unicode{x2013}$from architectural layout to furniture placement to small object population$\unicode{x2013}$each implemented as an interaction among VLM agents: designer, critic, and orchestrator. The framework tightly integrates asset generation through text-to-3D synthesis for static objects, dataset retrieval for articulated objects, and physical property estimation. SceneSmith generates 3-6x more objects than prior methods, with &lt;2% inter-object collisions and 96% of objects remaining stable under physics simulation. In a user study with 205 participants, it achieves 92% average realism and 91% average prompt faithfulness win rates against baselines. We further demonstrate that these environments can be used in an end-to-end pipeline for automatic robot policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Faster-GS: Analyzing and Improving Gaussian Splatting Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have focused on accelerating optimization while preserving reconstruction quality. However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.</description>

      <title>MPM Lite: Linear Kernels and Integration without Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MPM Lite, a new hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian method that eliminates the need for particle-based quadrature at solve time. Standard MPM practices suffer from a performance bottleneck where expensive implicit solves are proportional to particle-per-cell (PPC) counts due to the the choices of particle-based quadrature and wide-stencil kernels. In contrast, MPM Lite treats particles primarily as carriers of kinematic state and material history. By conceptualizing the background Cartesian grid as a voxel hexahedral mesh, we resample particle states onto fixed-location quadrature points using efficient, compact linear kernels. This architectural shift allows force assembly and the entire time-integration process to proceed without accessing particles, making the solver complexity no longer relate to particles. At the core of our method is a novel stress transfer and stretch reconstruction strategy. To avoid non-physical averaging of deformation gradients, we resample the extensive Kirchhoff stress and derive a rotation-free deformation reference solution, which naturally supports an optimization-based incremental potential formulation. Consequently, MPM Lite can be implemented as modular resampling units coupled with an FEM-style integration module, enabling the direct use of off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, and unambiguous boundary conditions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MPM Lite preserves the robustness and versatility of traditional MPM across diverse materials while delivering significant speedups in implicit settings and improving explicit settings at the same time.

      <title>Free-Boundary Quasiconformal Maps via a Least-squares Operator in Diffeomorphism Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-boundary diffeomorphism optimization, an important and widely occurring task in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and biological imaging, requires simultaneously determining a planar target domain and a locally bijective map with well-controlled distortion. We formulate this task through the least-squares quasiconformal (LSQC) operator and establish key structural properties of the LSQC minimizer, including well-posedness under mild conditions, invariance under similarity transformations, and resolution-independent behavior with stability under mesh refinement. We further analyze the sensitivity of the LSQC solution with respect to the Beltrami coefficient, establishing stability and differentiability properties that enable gradient-based optimization over the space of Beltrami coefficients. To make this differentiable formulation practical at scale and to facilitate the optimization process, we introduce the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), a multiscale mesh-spectral surrogate that approximates the LSQC solution operator in a single differentiable forward pass. This yields SBN-Opt, an optimization framework that searches over admissible Beltrami coefficients and pinning conditions to solve free-boundary diffeomorphism objectives with explicit distortion control. Extensive experiments on equiareal parameterization and inconsistent surface registration demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional numerical algorithms.</description>
