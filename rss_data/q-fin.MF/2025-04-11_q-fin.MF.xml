      <title>Application of CTS (Computer to Screen) Machine in Printing Industries for Process Improvement &amp; Material Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The printing and labeling industries are struggling to meet the need for more complex and dynamic design requirements coming from the customers. It is now crucial to implement technological advancements to manage workflow, productivity, process optimization, and continual improvement. There has never been a time when the imagery and embellishments of apparel has been more commercially viable as it is now. Images and text are fused directly to fabric by heat transfer printing and labeling. For screen development which is required for heat transfer label mass production, many industries are still using the conventional method of screen development process. A CTS (computer-to-screen) innovates the printing and labeling industries by enhancing workflow, lowering consumable consumptions and chemical usage, speeding up setup, guaranteeing flawless design, and raising the print quality of the producing screens. The study's objective is to assess how CTS machines are used and how they affect existing heat transfer screen development processes in one of Bangladesh's leading printing and labeling companies. The study's primary goal is to highlight and analyze how the use of CTS machines reduces material and operational costs by optimizing the process. Costs for CapEx and OpEx are computed and compared for using CTS technology before and after adoption. Savings data such as material, consumable, and operating cost savings versus depreciation and machine payback period analysis were taken into consideration. It is clear from this study that CTS machines in the printing and labeling industries can guarantee profitability on top of Capital Expenditures.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback--Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and prove an explicit representation of the Radon--Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, resulting in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints. We propose two deep learning algorithms to approximate the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with an extended application to combine implied volatility smile models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Market Making Games via Multidimensional Decoupling Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the macroscopic market making framework as a control problem, this paper investigates its extension to stochastic games. In the context of price competition, each agent is benchmarked against the best quote offered by the others. We begin with the linear case. While constructing the solution directly, the \textit{ordering property} and the dimension reduction in the equilibrium are revealed. For the non-linear case, we extend the decoupling approach by introducing a multidimensional \textit{characteristic equation} to analyse the well-posedness of the forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Properties of the coefficients in this characteristic equation are derived using tools from non-smooth analysis. Several new well-posedness results are presented.</description>
