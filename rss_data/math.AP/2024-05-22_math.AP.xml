      <title>Stochastic porous media equation with Robin boundary conditions, gravity-driven infiltration and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at studying a novel mathematical model associated to a physical phenomenon of infiltration in an homogeneous porous medium. The particularities of our system are connected to the presence of a gravitational acceleration term proportional to the level of saturation, and of a Brownian multiplicative perturbation. Furthermore, the boundary conditions intervene in a Robin manner with the distinction of the behavior along the inflow and outflow respectively. We provide qualitative results of well-posedness, the investigation being conducted through a functional approach.</description>

      <title>Trend to equilibrium for degenerate reaction-diffusion systems coming out of chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend to equilibrium for reaction-diffusion systems coming out of chemistry is investigated, in the case when reaction processes might happen only on some open subsets of the domain. A special case has been studied recently in [Desvillettes, L., \\&amp; Phung, K. D. (2022). Journal of Differential Equations, 338, 227-255] using log convexity technique from controllability theory, which in turn requires some amount of regularity for the solutions, and is difficult to generalise to more general systems. In this paper, we prove the convergence to equilibrium directly using vector-valued functional inequalities. One major advantage of our approach is that it allows to deal with nonlinearities of arbitrary orders, for which only global renormalised solutions are known to globally exist. For a specific situation where solutions are known to be bounded, we also prove the convergence to equilibrium when the diffusion as well as the reaction rates are degenerate. For this situation, we also treat the case  of  reactions happening in a set of strictly positive measure which may have an empty interior.</description>

      <title>Constructions of bounded solutions of $div\, {\mathbf u}=f$ in critical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct uniformly bounded solutions of the equation $div\, {\mathbf u}=f$ for arbitrary data $f$ in the critical spaces $L^d(\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ is a domain of ${\mathbb R}^d$. This question was addressed by Bourgain &amp; Brezis, [On the equation ${\rm div}\, Y=f$ and application to control of phases, JAMS 16(2) (2003) 393-426], who proved that although the problem has a uniformly bounded solution, it is critical in the sense that there exists no linear solution operator for general $L^d$-data. We first discuss the validity of this existence result under weaker conditions than $f\in L^d(\Omega)$, and then focus our work on constructive processes for such uniformly bounded solutions. In the $d=2$ case, we present a direct one-step explicit construction, which generalizes for $d&gt;2$ to a $(d-1)$-step construction based on induction. An explicit construction is proposed for compactly supported data in $L^{2,\infty}(\Omega)$ in the $d=2$ case. We also present constructive approaches based on optimization of a certain loss functional adapted to the problem. This approach provides a two-step construction in the $d=2$ case. This optimization is used as the building block of a hierarchical multistep process introduced in [E. Tadmor, Hierarchical construction of bounded solutions in critical regularity spaces, CPAM 69(6) (2016) 1087-1109] that converges to a solution in more general situations.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation from conical boundary points for fractional equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide fine asymptotics of solutions of fractional elliptic equations at boundary points where the domain is locally conical; that is, corner type singularities appear. Our method relies on a suitable smoothing of the corner singularity and an approximation scheme, which allow us to provide a Pohozaev type inequality. Then, the asymptotics of solutions at the conical point follow by an Almgren type monotonicity formula, blow-up analysis and Fourier decomposition on eigenspaces of a spherical eigenvalue problem. A strong unique continuation principle follows as a corollary.</description>

      <title>Generalized Strauss conjecture for semilinear wave equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we focus on the more delicate nonlinearity of the semilinear wave equation $$\partial_{t}^2 u-\Delta_{\mathbb{R}^3}u=|u|^{p_S}\mu(|u|)\ ,u(0,x)=\varepsilon u_0,\ u_t(0,x)=\varepsilon u_1\ ,$$ where $p_S=1+\sqrt{2}$ is the Strauss critical index in $n=3$, and $\mu$ is a modulus of continuity. Inspired by Chen, Reissig\cite{Chen_2024} and Ebert, Girardi, Reissig\cite{MR4163528}, we investigate the sharp condition of $\mu$ as the threshold between the global existence and blow up with small data. We obtain the almost sharp results in this paper, which in particular disproves the conjecture in \cite{Chen_2024}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the phenomenon of enhanced dissipation using techniques from the Malliavin Calculus. In particular, we construct a concise, elementary argument, that allows us to recover the well-known enhanced dissipation timescale for shear flows, first obtained by Bedrossian and Coti Zelati in 2017, as well as the precise hypoelliptic regularisation in x.</description>

      <title>On an impulsive faecal-oral model in a periodically evolving environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand how impulsive intervention and regional evolution jointly influence the spread of faecal-oral diseases, this paper develops an impulsive faecal-oral model in a periodically evolving environment. The well-posedness of the model is first checked. Then, the existence of the principal eigenvalue dependent on impulse intensity and evolving rate is proved based on Krein-Rutman theorem. With the help of this value, the threshold dynamical behaviours of the model are explored. More importantly, this paper also derives the monotonicity of the principal eigenvalue with respect to initial region and impulse intensity and estimates the principal eigenvalue in some special cases. Finally, numerical simulations are used to verify the correctness of the theoretical results and to explore the impact of regional evolution rate on the spread of the diseases. Our research shows that large impulsive intensity $1-g'(0)$ and small evolving rate $\rho(t)$ play a positive role in the prevention and control of the diseases.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for the homogenization problem in nonlinear elasticity: the incompressible case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider periodic homogenization of hyperelastic models incorporating incompressible behavior via the constraint $\det(\nabla u)=1$. We show that the 'usual' homogenized integral functional $\int W_{\rm hom}(\nabla u)\,dx$, where $W_{\rm hom}$ is the standard multicell-formula of non-convex homogenization restricted to volume preserving deformations, yields an upper bound for the $\Gamma$-limit as the scale of periodicity tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis at any order of Helmholtz's problem in a corner with a thin layer: an algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Helmholtz equation in an angular sector partially covered by a homogeneous layer of small thickness, denoted $\varepsilon$. We propose in this work an asymptotic expansion of the solution with respect to $\varepsilon$ at any order. This is done using matched asymptotic expansion, which consists here in introducing different asymptotic expansions of the solution in three subdomains: the vicinity of the corner, the layer and the rest of the domain. These expansions are linked through matching conditions. The presence of the corner makes these matching conditions delicate to derive because the fields have singular behaviors. Our approach is to reformulate these matching conditions purely algebraically by writing all asymptotic expansions as formal series. By using algebraic calculus we reduce the matching conditions to scalar relations linking the singular behaviors of the fields. These relations have a convolutive structure and involve some coefficients that can be computed analytically. Our asymptotic expansion is justified rigorously with error estimates.</description>

      <title>Conformal deformations of initial data sets to the strict dominant energy condition using a spacetime Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an alternate proof of one of the results given in [16] showing that initial data sets with boundary for the Einstein equations $(M, g, k)$ satisfying the dominant energy condition can be conformally deformed to the strict dominant energy condition, while preserving the character of the boundary (minimal, future trapped, or past trapped) while changing the area of the boundary and ADM energy of the initial data set by an arbitrarily small amount. The proof relies on solving an equation that looks like the equation for spacetime harmonic functions studied in [7], but with a Neumann boundary condition and non-zero right hand side, which we refer to as a spacetime Poisson equation. One advantage of this method of proof is that the conformal deformation is explicitly constructed as a solution to a PDE, as opposed to only knowing the solution exists via an application of the implicit function theorem as in [16]. We restrict ourselves to the physically relevant case of a $3$-manifold $M$, though the proof can be generalized to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Feller generators with singular drifts in the critical range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider diffusion operator $-\Delta + b \cdot \nabla$ in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 3$, with drift $b$ in a large class of locally unbounded vector fields that can have critical-order singularities. Covering the entire range of admissible magnitudes of singularities of $b$ (but excluding the borderline value), we construct a strongly continuous Feller semigroup on the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, thus completing a number of results on well-posedness of SDEs with singular drifts. The previous results on Feller semigroups employed strong elliptic gradient bounds and hence required the magnitude of the singularities to be less than a small dimension-dependent constant. Our approach is different and uses De Giorgi's method ran in $L^p$ for $p$ sufficiently large, hence the gain in the assumptions on singular drift.
  For the critical borderline value of the magnitude of singularities of $b$, we construct a strongly continuous semigroup in a ``critical'' Orlicz space on $\mathbb R^d$ whose local topology is stronger than the local topology of $L^p$ for any $2 \leq p&lt;\infty$ but is slightly weaker than that of $L^\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We show the non-compactness of moduli space of solutions of the monopole equations for $3/2$-spinors on a closed 3-manifold is equivalent to the existence of `3/2-Fueter sections' that are solutions of an overdetermined non-linear elliptic differential equation. These are sections of a fiber bundle whose fiber is a special 4-dimensional submanifold of the hyperk\"ahler manifold of center-framed charged one $SU(2)$-instantons on $\mathbf{R}^4$. This fiber bundle does not inherit a hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of an $N$-particle Markovian controlled system to the solution of a family of stochastic McKean-Vlasov control problems, either with a finite horizon or Schr\"odinger type cost functional. Specifically, under suitable assumptions, we prove the convergence of the value functions, the fixed-time probability distributions, and the relative entropy of their path-space probability laws. These proofs are based on a Benamou-Brenier type reformulation of the problem and a superposition principle, both of which are tools from the theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an obstacle problem for a generalization of the p-elastic energy among graphical curves with fixed ends. Taking into account that the Euler--Lagrange equation has a degeneracy, we address the question whether solutions have a flat part, i.e. an open interval where the curvature vanishes. We also investigate which is the main cause of the loss of regularity, the obstacle or the degeneracy. Moreover, we give several conditions on the obstacle that assure existence and nonexistence of solutions. The analysis can be refined in the special case of the p-elastica functional, where we obtain sharp existence results and uniqueness for symmetric minimizers.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of planar Navier-Stokes shocks with spatial oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that for the three-dimensional compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations, the planar viscous shocks are time-asymptotically stable to suitably small initial perturbations with zero masses. In particular, the perturbations consist of not only $ H^3 $-perturbations, but also periodic ones that oscillate at spatial infinity. In the former case, the final shock locations can be predicted in terms of the initial conditions, while in the latter the locations are subject to the dynamics of the oscillations. The stability analysis is based on the $L^2$-energy method. The key point is that the bad effect due to the compression of the shock waves can be removed by a combination of an anti-derivative technique and the use of Poincar\'{e} inequality in the normal and transversal directions, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic version of the optimal transport problem. We provide an analysis by means of the study of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is set on the set of probability measures. We introduce a new definition of viscosity solutions of this equation, which yields general comparison principles, in particular for cases involving terms modeling stochasticity in the optimal control problem. We are then able to establish results of existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. These results rely on controllability results for stochastic optimal transport that we also establish.</description>

      <title>Cancellation properties and unconditional well-posedness for the fifth order KdV type equations with periodic boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fifth order KdV type equations and prove the unconditional well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s \ge 1$. It is optimal in the sense that the nonlinear terms can not be defined in the space-time distribution framework for $s&lt;1$. The main idea is to employ the normal form reduction and a kinds of cancellation properties to deal with the derivative losses.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal balance equation: representation and approximation of solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal balance equation that describes the evolution of a system consisting of infinitely many identical particles those move along a deterministic dynamics and can also either disappear or give a spring. In this case, the solution of the balance equation is considered in the space of nonnegative measures. We prove the superposition principle for the examined nonlocal balance equation. Furthermore, we interpret the source/sink term as a probability rate of jumps from/to a remote point. Using this idea and replacing the deterministic dynamics of each particle by a nonlinear Markov chain, we approximate the solution of the balance equation by a solution of a system of ODEs and evaluate the corresponding approximation rate. This result can be used for construction of numerical solutions of the nonlocal balance equation.</description>

      <title>No anomalous dissipation in two-dimensional incompressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any sequence of vanishing viscosity Leray-Hopf solutions to the periodic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations does not display anomalous dissipation if the initial vorticity is a measure with positive singular part. A key step in the proof is the use of the Delort-Majda concentration-compactness argument to exclude formation of atoms in the vorticity measure, which in particular implies that the limiting velocity is an admissible weak solution to Euler. This is the first result proving absence of dissipation in a class of solutions in which the velocity fails to be strongly compact in $L^2$, putting two-dimensional turbulence in sharp contrast with respect to that in three dimensions. Moreover, our proof reveals that the amount of energy dissipation can be bounded by the vorticity measure of a disk of size $\sqrt \nu$, matching the two-dimensional Kolmogorov dissipative length scale which is expected to be sharp.</description>

      <title>On self-similar solutions of a multi-phase Stefan problem in the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study self-similar solutions of a multi-phase Stefan problem for a heat equation on the half-line $x&gt;0$ with a constant initial data and with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. In the case of Dirichlet boundary condition we prove that a nonlinear algebraic system for determination of the free boundaries is gradient one and the corresponding potential is an explicitly written strictly convex and coercive function. Therefore, there exists a unique minimum point of the potential, coordinates of this point determine free boundaries and provide the desired solution. This result is also extended to the case of infinitely many phase transitions. In the case of Neumann boundary condition we demonstrate that the problem may have solutions with different numbers (called types) of phase transitions. For each fixed type $n$ the system for determination of the free boundaries is again gradient and the corresponding potential is proved to be strictly convex and coercive, but in some wider non-physical domain. On the base of these properties it is proved that there exists a unique solution of Stefan-Neumann problem, and we also provide precise conditions to specify the type of the solution.

      <title>Two-step minimization approach to an $L^\infty$-constrained variational problem with a generalized potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variational problem on $H^1({\mathbb R})$ under an $L^\infty$-constraint related to Sobolev-type inequalities for a class of generalized potentials, including $L^p$-potentials, non-positive potentials, and signed Radon measures. We establish various essential tools for this variational problem, including the decomposition principle, the comparison principle, and the perturbation theorem, which are the basis of the two-step minimization method. As for their applications, we present precise results for minimizers of minimization problems, such as the study of potentials of Dirac's delta measure type and the analysis of trapped modes in potential wells.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet problem for Monge-Amp\`ere type equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Dirichlet problem for Monge-Amp\`ere type equations for p-plurisubharmonic functions on Riemannian manifolds. The a priori estimates up to the second order derivatives of solutions are established. The existence of a solution then follows by the continuity method.</description>
