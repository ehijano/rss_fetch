      <title>How fast can protons decay?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current laboratory bounds imply that protons are extremely long-lived. However, this conclusion may not hold for all time and in all of space. We find that the proton lifetime can be $\sim 15$ orders of magnitude shorter in the relatively recent past on Earth, or at the present time elsewhere in the Milky Way. A number of terrestrial and astrophysical constraints are examined and potential signals are outlined. We also sketch possible models that could lead to spatial or temporal variations in the proton lifetime. A positive signal could be compelling evidence for a new long range force of Nature, with important implications for the limitations of fundamental inferences based solely on laboratory measurements.</description>

      <title>Testing cogenesis during reheating with primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in an extended reheating period after the end of slow-roll inflation. Within the regime of perturbative reheating, we consider different monomial potential of the inflaton field during reheating era. The inflaton condensate reheats the Universe by decaying into the Standard Model (SM) bath either via fermionic or bosonic decay modes. Assuming the leptogenesis route to baryogenesis in a canonical seesaw framework, we consider the bath to produce such RHNs during the period of reheating when the maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$ of the SM bath is well above the reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$. The DM, assumed to be a SM gauge singlet field, also gets produced from the bath during the reheating period via UV freeze-in. In addition to obtaining different parameter space for such non-thermal leptogenesis and DM for both bosonic and fermionic reheating modes and the type of monomial potential, we discuss the possibility of probing such scenarios via spectral shape of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The neutrino force at all length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model predicts a long-range force mediated by a pair of neutrinos, known as "the neutrino force." We derive an expression for this force that is valid for all $r$. For large $r$, it reduces to the known $G_F^2/r^5$ form, while for small $r$, it scales as $1/r$. We explore the implications of this result for atomic parity violation (APV) experiments. A key feature of the neutrino force is that it is a long-range effect, meaning it cannot be treated as a correction to the tree-level exchange $Z$ diagram. We calculate the effects in muonium and positronium, finding that the neutrino force contributes about 4% and 16%, respectively, compared to the leading $ Z$ exchange. This indicates a significant impact on APV, with important implications for detecting the neutrino force and measuring the weak mixing angle in APV experiments.</description>

      <title>Absorption of a twisted photon by an electron in strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work investigates absorption of a twisted photon, which possesses quantized total angular momentum (TAM), by a relativistic electron with the Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1-10$ in a strong magnetic field up to the Schwinger limit, $H_c = 4.4\cdot 10^{13}$ G. We examine the absorption cross sections and their dependence on the parameters of the incident photon and the initial Landau electron. It is found that total absorption cross sections decrease as angular momentum of the incident photon increases and increase as angular momentum of the initial electron grows. The process is also compared across different magnetic field strengths, and the contribution of various electron spin transitions to total absorption cross section is analyzed. We also find that the processes without an electron spin flip dominate and, on top of that, an asymmetry in the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' and the ``spin-up'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-down'' transitions is observed. Specifically, the cross sections for the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' transition are larger, which can be interpreted as an analogy of the Sokolov-Ternov effect present for photon emission. Finally, the cross sections are found to be almost constant as the transverse momentum of the photon varies from $0.1$ eV to $100$ keV. Our findings can help to improve the understanding of the QED processes in critical fields, typical for astrophysical environments, e.g. magnetospheres of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of Infrared Divergences in $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow q\bar{q}g$ in Light Front Coherent State Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of cancellation of infrared (IR) divergences at the amplitude level in Light Front Quantum Chromodynamics (LFQCD) using the coherent state formalism. We consider the process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow q\bar{q}g$ upto $\mathcal{O}(g^3)$ in light-cone-time-ordered Hamiltonian perturbation theory and show that IR divergences in S-matrix elements appear due to vanishing energy denominators. We construct the coherent state formalism for LFQCD and explicitly show that these divergences are cancelled when a coherent state basis is used for calculating the S-matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis for the anomalous $tq\gamma$ couplings via $ \gamma q {\rightarrow} t {\gamma}$ subprocess in photon-proton collisions at the FCC-${\mu}$p</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate anomalous flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions related to the top quark, particularly the $t\rightarrow q\gamma$ transition, within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. These rare processes are largely suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) and are strong indicators for new physics scenarios beyond the SM. In our study, we have analyzed the cross sections of the $ \gamma q {\rightarrow} t {\gamma}$ subprocess for two different center-of-mass energies, 17.3 TeV and 24.5 TeV, at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-${\mu}$p) collider. Our results derived from simulations show that the branching ratios for these processes can be reduced to the order of $10^{-5} $. These values provide significantly tighter limits than the current experimental limits. In light of these findings, it can be stated that the FCC-${\mu}$p collider offers significant potential for discovering new physics which represents a sensitivity improvement over the current experimental limits from CMS, enhancing sensitivity by approximately 30\%.Moreover, it has been demonstrated that higher centre-of-mass energies and integrated luminosity values significantly enhance the discovery potential of these rare processes. Accordingly, the results indicate that-energy colliders such as FCC-${\mu}$p are of critical importance in the search for new physics and in the study of the role of the top quark in the context of flavour physics. As a result, by providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis, this study contributes to the importance of FCNC processes in the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model and will shed light on future experimental and phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Minimal SO(10) ante portas: the importance of being effective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal $SO(10)$ grand unified theory, augmented by higher-dimensional operators, is based on the following Higgs representations: adjoint $45_{\rm H}$, spinor $16_{\rm H}$ and complex vector $10_{\rm H}$. It was recently realized that, as opposed to the conventional wisdom, any intermediate mass scale has to lie close to the grand unification one. This bears profound consequences for the scalar particles mass spectrum and the proton decay lifetime. A complete analysis of the parameter space shows the following interesting correlation under the requirement of perturbativity of the theory: A color octet below approximately $5\,\rm TeV$ would imply a lower bound on neutrino mass $m_{\nu}\gtrsim 0.2\,\rm eV$, soon to be probed, a scalar weak triplet below $500\,\rm GeV$ and a scalar weak doublet, color triplet below $3\,\rm TeV$. If one were to stick to no flavor cancellations in proton decay amplitudes, one would recover a recent result of all these states being accessible at collider energies. Moreover, the proton decay lifetime would then be tantalizingly close to the present experimental bound.</description>

      <title>Searches for BSM physics at a gamma-gamma collider with Energy &lt; $12$ GeV based on European XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of a Photon-Photon collider extension to the Beam dump of the $17.5$ GeV European XFEL has been discussed before as the first high energy collider of its sort. It would not just be to study the concept of photon colliders but would also be a collider without competition in the region of $5 - 12$ GeV for photon-photon collision. In this range, $b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ resonances, tetraquarks as well as mesonic molecules can be observed. Furthermore, some BSM processes can also be reached in this range. In this paper we want to discuss the possibility of observing ALPs at such a collider. We will use a simplified description of the compton backscattering process to get a first look at cross sections and extend this to the full beam dynamics included prediction.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>Probing long-lived doubly charged scalar in the Georgi-Machacek model at the LHC and in far detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for long-lived particles (LLPs) beyond the Standard Model (SM) is a promising direction in collider experiments. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model extends the scalar sector in the SM by introducing various new scalar bosons. In this study, we focus on the parameter space that allows the light doubly charged scalar to become long-lived. This light doubly charged scalar is fermophobic and predominantly decays into a pair of on-shell or off-shell same-sign $W$ bosons. We investigate three types of signal signatures at the LHC: displaced vertices in the inner tracking detector, displaced showers in the muon system, and heavy stable charged particles. Additionally, we analyze the potential for detecting such doubly charged scalars in far detectors, including ANUBIS, MATHUSLA, FACET, and FASER. By combining the LLP searches at the LHC and in far detectors, we project that the limits on the mixing angle, $\theta_H$, (between the doublet and triplets) can cover most of the parameter space with $\sin\theta_H\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for the mass range of long-lived doubly charged scalars between $50$ GeV to $180$ GeV, assuming luminosities of 300 fb$^{-1}$ and 3000 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>$P$-wave charmonium contribution to hidden-charm states from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze, considering the contribution of $P$-wave charmonia, lattice data for the $D \overline{D}$-$D_s \overline{D}_s$ coupled-channel and $D \overline{D}{}^\ast$ systems and search for hidden-charm states with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{++}$, and $2^{++}$ quantum numbers. For $0^{++}$, the analysis reveals three poles in the $D\overline{D}$-$D_s \overline{D}_s$ coupled-channel amplitude, corresponding to three states. Two of these poles, located near the $D\overline{D}$ and $D_s \overline{D}_s$ thresholds, can be interpreted as mostly molecular states. A third pole above the $D_s \overline{D}_s$ threshold is originated from the $P$-wave $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state. In the $1^{++}$ sector, we find two poles in the complex energy plane. The first one is related to the molecular $X(3872)$ state, with a compositeness exceeding $90\%$, while the second one, stemming from the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ charmonium, appears above the $D\overline{D}{}^\ast$ threshold and it likely corresponds to the recently discovered $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ state. In the $2^{++}$ sector, we also report two poles and find that the dressed $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ is lighter than the $D^\ast\overline{D}{}^\ast$ molecular state, with the dynamics of the latter closely related to that of the heavy-quark spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$.</description>

      <title>Formation, dissociation and regeneration of charmonia within microscopic Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic and dynamical model to study the formation, as well as dissociation and recombination processes of charmonium states in a heat bath at constant temperature and volume. Within this classical approach, the heavy quarks are described as Brownian particles in a background medium of light constituents and can therefore be described in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation with constant transport coefficients, which is then materialized through with relativistic Langevin simulations. The heavy quarks interact classically over a Coulomb-like screened potential to form a bound state if the relative energy of the pair becomes negative. Dissociation of bound states are possible as a result of screening effects of the potential as well as through scatterings with plasma particles. We demonstrate the full equilibration of the system and show that, for tuning the coupling constant, the obtained equilibrium charmonium yields are in accordance with the Statistical Hadronization Model.</description>

      <title>Approaching Stable Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of whether the ground state of baryon matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the ordinary nucleus or a quark matter state remains a long-standing question in physics. A critical parameter in this investigation is the bag parameter $B$, which quantifies the QCD vacuum energy and can be computed using nonperturbative methods such as Lattice QCD (LQCD). By combining the equation of state derived from perturbative QCD (pQCD) with the bag parameter to fit the LQCD-simulated data for isospin-dense matter, we address the stability of quark matter within the LQCD+pQCD framework. Our findings suggest that the current data imposes an upper bound on $B^{1/4} \lesssim 160$ MeV, approaching a conclusive statement on quark matter stability. Additionally, we derive more general thermodynamic bounds on the quark matter energy-per-baryon and $B$, which, while weaker, provide complementary insights.</description>

      <title>Flavoring the production of Higgs pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the possibility of observing a hypothetical particle known as the Flavon $H_F$, which is predicted in an extension of the standard model that includes the so-called Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. The proposed decay channel is through a $b\bar{b}h$ final state, where the Higgs boson $(h)$ decays to a pair of photons or a pair of $b$ quarks $(h\to \gamma\gamma,\,b\bar{b})$. We found that, under special scenarios of the model parameter space, the processes analyzed could provide evidence for the existence of the Flavon in the next stage of the LHC: the High Luminosity LHC. Specifically, we predict a \textit{signal significance} of $5\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) in the $h\to b\bar{b}$ ($h\to\gamma\gamma$) channel for a Flavon mass of $800$ ($900$) GeV and an integrated luminosity of $2500$ ($3000$) fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Lepton Portal on the WIMP-pFIMP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics and detection possibility of a pseudo-FIMP (pFIMP) dark matter (DM) in the presence of a thermal DM have been studied in different contexts. The pFIMP phenomenology largely depends on the WIMP-like partner DM, as pFIMP interacts with the standard model (SM) particles only via the partner DM loop. Introducing a lepton portal interaction, which connects DM directly to the SM lepton sector, improves its detection prospects. However, such possibilities are constrained strongly by the non-observation of lepton flavor-violating decays. Interestingly, this also makes it possible to probe such models in future low-energy experiments. In this article, we have tried to establish such connections and find parameter space which respects the limits from DM relic, direct, indirect, and lepton flavor violation (LFV). We also recast the constraints from di-lepton/di-tau plus missing energy signal at the LHC on our model and provide projections for HL-LHC and future lepton colliders. Although the LFV and collider limits mainly concern WIMPs, the parameter space for pFIMPs is also constrained due to its strong connection to WIMPs through DM relic density and detection prospects.</description>

      <title>Calculation of heavy meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for calculating heavy quark effective theory (HQET) light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) by employing a sequential effective theory methodology. The theoretical foundation of the framework is established, elucidating how the quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi DAs) with three scales can be utilized to compute HQET LCDAs. We provide theoretical support for this approach by demonstrating the rationale behind devising a hierarchical ordering for the three involved scales, discussing the factorization at each step, clarifying the underlying reason for obtaining HQET LCDAs in the final phase, and addressing potential theoretical challenges. The lattice QCD simulation aspect is explored in detail, and the computations of quasi DAs are presented. We employ three fitting strategies to handle contributions from excited states and extract the bare matrix elements. For renormalization purposes, we apply hybrid renormalization schemes at short and long distance separations. To mitigate long-distance perturbations, we perform an extrapolation in $\lambda= z\cdot P^z$ and assess the stability against various parameters. After two-step matching, our results for HQET LCDAs are found in agreement with existing model parametrizations. The potential phenomenological implications of the results are discussed, shedding light on how these findings could impact our understanding of the strong interaction dynamics and physics beyond the standard model. It should be noted, however, that systematic uncertainties have not been accounted for yet.</description>

      <title>Relativistic fluid dynamics in a 'hydro' frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate how field redefinition influences the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic fluid dynamics. We show that the hydrodynamic modes do not get affected under local field redefinition, whereas the non-hydrodynamic modes do. These non-hydrodynamic modes can be removed through a suitable all-order field redefinition. This process leads to a new frame containing only hydrodynamic modes, which we refer to as the hydro frame. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting stress-energy tensor may constitute an infinite series in momentum space, with the radius of convergence associated with the removed non-hydrodynamic mode, highlighting its role in the hydrodynamic expansion's validity.</description>

      <title>Graded transcendental functions: an application to four-point amplitudes with one off-shell leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a general method for constructing a minimal basis of transcendental functions tailored to a scattering amplitude. Starting with formal solutions for all master integral topologies, we grade the appearing functions by properties such as their symbol alphabet or letter adjacency. We rotate the basis such that functions with spurious features appear in the least possible number of basis elements. Since their coefficients must vanish for physical quantities, this approach avoids complex cancellations. As a first application, we evaluate all integral topologies relevant to the three-loop $Hggg$ and $Hgq\bar{q}$ amplitudes in the leading-colour approximation and heavy-top limit. We describe the derivation of canonical differential equation systems and present a method for fixing boundary conditions without the need for a full functional representation. Using multiple numerical reductions, we test the maximal transcendentality conjecture for $Hggg$ and identify a new letter which appears in functions of weight 4 and 5. In addition, we provide the first direct analytic computation of a three-point form factor of the operator $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^2)$ in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM and find agreement with numerical and bootstrapped results.</description>

      <title>A cosmological case study of a tower of warm dark matter states: $N$naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the cosmological effects of a tower of warm dark matter states on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and on large-scale structure (LSS). For concreteness, we consider the $N$naturalness model, which is a proposed mechanism to solve the Higgs hierarchy problem. In this framework, the sector of particles of the Standard Model is copied $N$ times where the Higgs mass-squared value is the only parameter that changes between sectors. The other sectors are similar to our own, except their particles are proportionally heavier and cooler compared to the Standard Model sector. Since each sector is extremely weakly coupled to other sectors, direct observations of the new particles are not expected. The addition of new photon-like species and new neutrino-like species, however, can be detected through the CMB and in LSS data. These additional neutrinos form a tower of states with increasing mass and decreasing temperature compared to the SM neutrinos. This tower causes a more gradual suppression of the matter power spectrum across different comoving wavenumbers than a single warm dark matter state would. We quantitatively explore these effects in the $N$naturalness model and compute the parameter space allowed by the Planck 2018, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ datasets. Depending on the underlying parameters, Planck 2018 and weak lensing data can require $N$naturalness to be tuned at the $10\%$ level for Dirac neutrinos and at the $5\%$ level for Majorana neutrinos. The additional neutrino states are crucial in constraining the model, particularly through their suppression of the power spectrum at small scales. The inclusion of many warm dark matter species is computationally very challenging and we make detailed assessments of our approximations and comment on potential future improvements.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard, Tsallis, and q-dual statistics from transverse momentum spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold (Au+Au) collisions across various centrality classes at center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV, as measured by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis employs standard (Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac), Tsallis, and q-dual statistics to fit the same $p_T$ spectra and derive distinct effective temperatures: $T_{\text{Standard}}$, $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$, and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$. In most instances, there exists an approximately linear relationship or positive correlation between $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, as well as between $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, when considering $T_{\text{Standard}}$ as a baseline. However, while both $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ increase from semi-central to central Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, where QGP is expected, changes in $T_{\text{Standard}}$ occur more gradually. This work suggests that $T_{\text{Standard}}$ is better suited for characterizing phase transitions between hadronic matter and QGP compared to $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ or $T_{\text{q-dual}}$, primarily due to the considerations related to entropy index in the Tsallis and q-dual statistics.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>A rigorous solution to the superluminal issue in the diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminal propagation is an intrinsic problem in the diffusion equation and has not been effectively addressed for a long time. In this work, a rigorous solution to this issue is obtained under the assumption that particles undergo a random flight process, where they move isotropically at a constant speed while experiencing random scatterings. We validate this solution by comparing it with comprehensive simulations of the random flight process and find that it significantly deviates from the solution derived from the J\"{u}ttner propagator. This solution is broadly applicable to various diffusion phenomena, such as cosmic-ray propagation. We emphasize that our rigorous solution is particularly crucial in scenarios involving burst-like particle injection, where previous phenomenological approaches to the superluminal diffusion problem may not yield accurate results.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Dyson Summation of Perturbation Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical system of approximations for summing both conventional perturbation theory and large N vector expansions of models in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. Each stage of the hierarchy consists of a closed set of nonlinear equations for one particle irreducible correlation functions with no more than K points and captures the perturbation expansion of each of those functions up to some finite order. As K goes to infinity the full Schwinger Dyson hierarchy is approached. We present an argument that for ordinary finite dimensional integrals, the procedure converges to the exact answer in this limit, despite the fact that no finite order of the hierarchy sees effects from non-leading saddle points of the integral. Some potential applications to the calculation of critical exponents, to low dimensional condensed matter systems, and to the phase structure of the homogeneous electron gas are outlined, but no detailed calculations are presented.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the two-photon exchange correction to the unpolarized cross section in the elastic muon-proton scattering within dispersion relations. One of the six independent invariant amplitudes requires a subtraction. We fix the subtraction function to the model estimate of the full two-photon exchange at one of three MUSE beam energies and make a prediction for the two other energies. Additionally, we present single and double polarization observables accounting for the lepton mass.</description>

Abstract: We study possible strong first-order electroweak phase transitions in Composite Higgs models and we quantify the part of parameter space that can be probed with future gravitational Wave experiments. We focus on models where the Composite Higgs sector arises from underlying four-dimensional strongly interacting gauge theories with fermions, and where the Standard Model fermion masses are induced via linear mixing terms with composite fermions -- the so-called fermion partial compositeness framework. We perform our analysis for the general class of Composite Higgs models arising from $ N $ Weyl fermions in a pseudo-real representation of the new strongly interacting gauge group that dynamically triggers the global chiral symmetry breaking pattern $\rm{SU(}$$N$$\rm{)}\rightarrow \rm{Sp(}$$N$$\rm{)}$. The minimal model has $ N=4 $ and for $ N&gt;4 $ the models feature complex scalar dark matter candidates arising as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We find a large number of points in the models parameter space which yield strong first-order electroweak phase transitions and identify the most important operators characterizing the strength of the phase transition. Almost all of these points are testable with future GW detectors such as LISA, Taiji, Tianqin, BBO, DECIGO and Ultimate-DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Leading two-loop corrections to the Higgs di-photon decay in the Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leading two-loop contributions to the di-photon decay of the Higgs boson are evaluated for the first time in the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). We employ for this calculation the Higgs low-energy theorem, meaning that we obtain corrections to the Higgs decay process by taking Higgs-field derivatives of the leading two-loop contributions to the photon self-energy. Specifically, we have included corrections involving inert BSM Higgs bosons and gauge bosons, as well as external-leg contributions involving inert scalars, gauge bosons and fermions. Our calculation has been performed with a full on-shell renormalization, and in the gauge-less limit. Moreover, we performed two independent calculations, using the background-field method and the pinch technique, in order to apply the Higgs low-energy theorem consistently, and found full agreement between the two calculations. We investigate our results numerically in two scenarios of the IDM: one with a light dark matter (DM) candidate (Higgs resonance scenario), and another with all additional scalars heavy (heavy Higgs scenario). In both cases, we find that the inclusion of two-loop corrections qualitatively modifies the behavior of the decay width, compared with the one-loop ($i.e.$ leading) order, and that they increase the deviation from the Standard Model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inclusion of the newly-computed two-loop corrections is essential to reliably interpret the observation or non-observation of a deviation in the Higgs di-photon decay width at current and future colliders.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that non-gravitational interactions between dark matter and baryonic matter can affect structural properties of galaxies. Detailed galaxy simulations and analytic estimates demonstrate that dark matter which collects inside white dwarf stars and ignites Type Ia supernovae can substantially alter star formation, stellar feedback, and the halo density profile through a dark matter-induced baryonic feedback process, distinct from usual supernova feedback in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decay rates in the presence of light sterile neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in minimal extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics where gauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos give rise to Dirac and Majorana neutrino mass terms. We argue that the standard treatment of these scenarios, based on mass-dependent nuclear matrix elements, is missing important contributions to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ amplitude. First, new effects arise from the exchange of neutrinos with very small (ultrasoft) momenta, for which we compute the associated nuclear matrix elements for the decays of ${}^{76}$Ge and ${}^{136}$Xe. These contributions can dominate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ rate in cases with light sterile neutrinos. The ultrasoft terms are also relevant in the more standard scenario of just three light Majorana neutrinos where they lead to a $10\%$ reduction of the total $0\nu\beta\beta$ amplitude. Secondly, we highlight the importance of short-range terms associated with medium-heavy sterile neutrinos and provide explicit formulae that can be used in phenomenological analyses. As examples we discuss impact of these new effects in several explicit scenarios, including a realistic $3+2$ model with two right-handed gauge-singlet neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Regularization effects in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model: Strong scheme dependence of inhomogeneous phases and persistence of the moat regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the phase structure of the non-renormalizable (3+1)-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with particular focus on inhomogeneous phases (IPs), where the chiral condensate is non-uniform in space, and the closely related moat regimes, where mesonic dispersion relations favor non-vanishing momenta. We use the mean-field approximation and consider five different regularization schemes including three lattice discretizations. The results within the different regularization schemes are systematically analyzed in order to study the dependence of the IP on the choice of regulatization scheme and regulator value. The IP exhibits a drastic dependence on the chosen regularization scheme rendering any physical interpretation of results on inhomogeneous phases in this model doubtful. In contrast, we find only a mild scheme dependence of the moat regime suggesting that its existence is a consequence of the action of the NJL model and its symmetries and, thus, that it might also exist in QCD.</description>

      <title>Constraints for scalars and pseudoscalars from $\left(g-2\right)_l$ and existing $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalars and pseudoscalars with masses in the MeV to GeV range are of interest in different extensions of the Standard Model. Such particles are often associated with dark matter, the strong CP problem and the $\left(g-2\right)_{\mu}$ anomaly. In this work we investigate limits for masses of such particles and their couplings to photons and leptons which can be derived from present and currently operating $e^+e^-$ collider experiments and recent $\left(g-2\right)_{l}$ measurements. Our work expands upon previous studies in several ways, demonstrating that the interplay of both couplings is a decisive factor in this type of analyses.</description>

      <title>Exploring multi-step electroweak phase transitions in the 2HDM+$\boldsymbol{a}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple electroweak phase transitions occurring sequentially in the early universe can give rise to intriguing phenomenology, compared to the typical single-step electroweak phase transition. In this work, we investigate this scenario within the framework of the two-Higgs-doublet model with a pseudoscalar, utilizing the complete one-loop finite-temperature effective potential. After considering relevant experimental and theoretical constraints, we identify four distinct types of phase transitions. In the first case, only the configuration of the CP-even Higgs acquires a non-zero value via a first-order or a cross-over electroweak phase transition, leading to electroweak symmetry breaking. In the remaining three cases, the pseudoscalar fields can obtain vacuum expectation values at different phases of the multi-step phase transition process, leading to spontaneous breaking of the CP symmetry. As the temperature decreases, the phase shifts to the vacuum observed today via first-order electroweak phase transition, at this point, the vacuum expectation value of the pseudoscalar field returns to zero, restoring the CP symmetry. Finally, we compare the transition strength and the stochastic gravitational wave background generated in the four situations along with the projected detection limits.</description>

      <title>Angular integrals with three denominators via IBP, mass reduction, dimensional shift, and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system. By explicit computation, we derive a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our proposed method using the scattering length drive is applicable to a wide range of ultracold atomic systems, and our results establish these as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Swampland Conjectures Constraints on Dark Energy from a Highly Curved Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC) and the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) in the context of multifield dark energy in a curved field space. In this scenario, the phase of accelerated expansion is realized as non-geodesic motion in a highly-curved field space, reminiscent of models developed in the context of inflation. The model features a stable attractor solution with near constant equation of state $w\simeq -1$, and predicts that the current era of accelerated expansion is eternal. The latter implies an eventual conflict with the TCC, which holds that the duration of any epoch of cosmic acceleration is bounded by the requirement that the large-scale observable universe is blind to Planck-scale early universe physics. This tension can be resolved by an interplay with the distance conjecture: for suitable parameter values, the apparent violation of the TCC occurs well after the fields have traversed a Planckian distance. The SDC then predicts a breakdown of the effective field theory (EFT) before the TCC can be violated. We derive the constraints on the model arising from the SDC+TCC and the de Sitter conjecture. We demonstrate that the model can be consistent with both swampland conjectures and observational data from Planck 2018 and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Spin Particles, On Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study on-shell scattering amplitudes for continuous-spin particles (CSPs). Poincar\'e invariance, little-group $ISO(2)$ covariance, analyticity, and on-shell factorisation (unitarity) impose stringent conditions on these amplitudes. We solve them by realizing a non-trivial representation for all little-group generators on the space of functions of bi-spinors. The three-point amplitudes are uniquely determined by matching their high-energy limit to that of definite-helicity (ordinary) massless particles. Four-point amplitudes are then bootstrapped using consistency conditions, allowing us to analyze the theory in a very transparent way, without relying on any off-shell Lagrangian formulation. We present several examples that highlight the main features of the resulting scattering amplitudes. We discuss CSP's amplitudes as a new infrared deformation of ordinary massless amplitudes, which is controlled by the scale of the Pauli-Lubanski vector squared, as opposed to the familiar mass deformation. Finally, we explore under which conditions it is possible to relax some assumptions, such as strict on-shell factorisation, analyticity, or others. In particular, we also investigate how continuous-spin particles may couple to gravity and electromagnetism, in a loose version of $S$-matrix principles.</description>
