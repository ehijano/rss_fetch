      <title>An analytic model for description of muonic oxygen X-ray time distribution in muonic experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analytical model and perform numerical simulations to study the time distribution of the characteristic muonic oxygen X-ray emission following muon transfer from muonic hydrogen to oxygen in a $H_2+O_2$ gas mixture. The model accounts for all fundamental processes that alter the kinetic energy and spin distribution of muonic hydrogen atoms. The impact of the uncertainties in various experimental parameters on the precision of the computed results is studied in detail by means of Monte Carlo method. Verification against available experimental data reveals the potential of this approach for both description and parameter optimization in planning and analysis of muonic experiments.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Crystallization of Highly Charged Ni^12+ Ions in a Linear Paul Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical clocks have garnered widespread attention due to their unparalleled precision in time-frequency standards, geodetic measurements, and fundamental physics research. Among emerging developments, highly charged ion (HCI)-based optical clocks have attracted significant scientific interest owing to their exceptional resilience against electromagnetic perturbations and enhanced sensitivity to variations in the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$). While the recent successful demonstration of an Ar$^{13+}$ optical clock has validated the feasibility of HCI-based systems, Ni$^{12+}$ -- featuring an ultranarrow clock transition linewidth -- stands out as a superior candidate for achieving HCI optical clocks with $10^{-19}$ level uncertainty and stability. In this work, we report the Coulomb crystallization of nickel highly charged ions (Ni-HCIs). Through a precision deceleration and sympathetic cooling protocol in a room-temperature Paul trap, high-energy Ni-HCI bunches were sympathetically cooled from megakelvin to the 100-millikelvin range using laser-cooled Be$^{+}$ ions. This work represents a pivotal step toward the realization of an optical clock based on the Ni$^{12+}$ ion.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Mg$^+$ Properties using Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and Relativistic Coupled-cluster Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate behaviors of correlation effects in the calculations of atomic properties through two commonly employed many-body methods; namely multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) methods. Particularly, we have bench-marked excitation energies, electric dipole (E1) matrix elements, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants ($A_{hf}$), and isotope shift (IS) constants in the singly ionized magnesium (Mg$^+$) systematically at different levels of approximation of both methods. We have also estimated the E1 polarizability of the ground state and lifetimes of the excited states using the E1 matrix elements from both methods. All these results are compared with the experimental values wherever available. We find that the computed results agree well with each other with a few exceptions; particularly the $A_{hf}$ and IS constants from the RCC method are found to agree with the measurements better. This comparison analysis would be useful in evaluating the above-discussed properties in other atomic systems using the MCDHF and RCC methods more reliably.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the total spin angular momentum &lt;Fz&gt; of alkali-metal atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important to evaluate the total spin angular momentum of alkali-metal atoms if the atoms serve as a reservoir of angular momenta. We use an absorption-monitoring technique to measure &lt;Fz&gt;, i.e., the expectation values of the quantization (z) axis components of the total angular momentum of cesium (Cs) atoms in the electronic ground state in both uncoated and anti-relaxation-coated vacuum cells at room temperature. Cs atoms are polarized via optical pumping and probed using their D2 transitions. The probe laser frequency is varied across the Doppler-broadened D2 transition; the &lt;Fz&gt; values are derived using the integrated absorption coefficients. The largest &lt;Fz&gt; is 2.5 for the coated cell. We then use a simple model of spin flow through vapor cells to estimate the atomic spin relaxation probabilities after a single surface collision.</description>

      <title>Modulation transfer spectroscopy of $^7$Li D1 line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first implementation of modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) on the D$1$ line of $^7$Li, carried out in a compact heat-pipe vapor cell with cold windows. By varying the pump and probe intensities and polarization configurations, we systematically map the MTS error-signal amplitude, effective linewidth, and slope for the ground-state crossover resonance $F=1\times2\rightarrow F'=2$. We observe Rabi-induced power broadening and identify optimal conditions for laser frequency stabilization via tightly focused beams with total power below 1 mW. The lin$\perp$lin polarization configuration yields a sharp, symmetric, high-contrast error signal with a maximal slope. Our findings establish the MTS spectrum of the $^7$Li D1 line transitions as a reliable frequency reference for quantum technology and ultracold atom experiments, particularly in scenarios where frequency stabilization must be achieved with low laser optical power.</description>

      <title>$^{208}$Pb nuclear charge radius revisited: closing the fine-structure-anomaly gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive reevaluation of the root-mean-square nuclear charge radius is presented for the doubly magic $^{208}$Pb extracted from muonic spectroscopy measurements. By integrating rigorous theoretical quantum electrodynamics calculations, state-of-the-art numerical methods, and a systematic reanalysis of the uncertainties, we reduced the long-standing muonic fine-structure anomaly and improved the goodness of fit by a factor of twenty. The resulting value of 5.5062(5) fm is fairly consistent with the previously reported muonic spectroscopy value, and three standard deviations larger than the commonly used compilation data, which indicates that the current value and its uncertainty could be significantly underestimated. Our study paves a new path for systematic reevaluation of all rms radii based on muonic spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion II -- hyperfine-Zeeman spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum field theory such as Lorentz invariance, CPT symmetry and locality may be tested to extremely high precision in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The narrow natural linewidth of rovibrational states in the hydrogen molecular ion $H_2^+$ and its antimatter counterpart $\bar{H}_2^-$, make these ideal candidates, and give $O(m_p/m_e)$ increased sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation in the proton sector compared to $H$ and $\bar{H}$ atoms. In a previous paper, we presented a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of $H_2^+$ and $\bar{H}_2^-$ in an effective QFT encoding Lorentz and CPT violation, focusing on spin-independent effects. Here, we extend this analysis to include the full hyperfine-Zeeman spectrum and include spin-dependent Lorentz and CPT violating operators in the effective theory. The results demonstrate how constraints on these symmetry-violating couplings may be extracted from specific rovibrational transitions between hyperfine-Zeeman states in the presence of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cavities in BCC-Fe with coexisting H and He under fusion environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fusion environment, understanding the synergistic effects of transmutation-produced hydrogen (H), helium (He), and irradiation-induced displacement damage in iron-based alloys is crucial for the development of structural materials for fusion reactors. When H and He atoms are simultaneously introduced into the matrix, the interaction between irradiation-induced cavity defects (voids and bubbles) with H and He, along with their evolutionary behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, the evolutionary behavior of cavities in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron (Fe) with H and He atoms is systematically investigated through a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and statistical thermodynamics. First, an efficient and suitable set of Fe-H-He ternary potential functions for describing interatomic interactions is established. Based on the newly developed MD model, the evolutionary behavior of H/He atoms and cavities is systematically investigated under various temperature and cavity structure conditions. Specifically, the kinetic process of H/He capture by cavities is elucidated for different scenarios. Additionally, thermodynamic analyses are employed to assess the feasibility of cavity trapping of H under varying conditions. The results exhibit strong consistency with experimental results and provide significant evidence supporting the formation of the core-shell structure (where He is confined at the cavity center while H accumulates at the surface) from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. This work provides mechanistic insights into the nucleation and growth of cavities over extended temporal and spatial scales in the presence of H-He synergies.</description>

      <title>The charge cycle of group IV vacancy centers in diamond: From DFT to rate equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in diamond is a promising system for quantum technologies due to its exceptional optical and spin properties. This has led to great interest in the silicon-vacancy center as well as in the other group IV vacancy centers. In this work, we model the charge cycle of the group IV vacancy centers from the $-2$ to $0$ charge state. As a first step, we compute the onset energies for all relevant one- and two-step ionization processes. Based on these results, we then derive the rate equations using Fermi's golden rule.</description>

      <title>Measurement and feed-forward correction of the fast phase noise of lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit fidelity of operation. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz$^{2}$/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremely narrow natural linewidths of rovibrational energy levels in the molecular hydrogen ion $\textrm{H}_2^{\,+}$, and the prospect of synthesising its antimatter counterpart $\overline{\textrm{H}}_2^{\,-}$, make it a promising candidate for high-precision tests of fundamental symmetries such as Lorentz and CPT invariance. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion in a low-energy effective theory incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. The focus is on the spin-independent couplings in this theory, for which the best current bounds come from measurements of the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen. We show that in addition to the improvement in these bounds from the increased precision of the transition frequencies, potentially reaching 1 part in $10^{17}$, rovibrational transitions have an enhanced sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation of $O(m_p/m_e)$ in the proton (hadron) sector compared to atomic transitions.</description>

Abstract: The 8.4 eV transition in the $^{229}$Th nucleus is the basis for a high-precision nuclear clock with exceptional sensitivity to new physics effects. We have identified several cases in the Th$^+$ ion where electronic excitations closely resonate with the nuclear excitation, with the smallest energy difference being $\Delta = -0.09$ cm$^{-1}$. We investigate the electronic bridge process, in which nuclear excitation is induced via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper selection of laser frequencies can lead to a dramatic enhancement of this effect. Additionally, we show that the interaction with electrons significantly shortens the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry analysis of Autler-Townes doublet in the trap-loss fluorescence spectroscopy of cesium MOT with single step Rydberg excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autler-Townes (AT) doublet, a fundamental manifestation of quantum interference effects, serves as a critical tool for studying the dynamic behavior of Rydberg atoms. Here, we investigate the asymmetry of the Autler-Townes (AT) doublet in trap-loss fluorescence spectroscopy (TLFS) of cesium (Cs) atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) with single-step Rydberg excitation using a 319-nm ultraviolet (UV) laser. A V-type three-level system involving the ground state $6\text{S}_{1/2}$ ($\text{F}$=4), excited state $6\text{P}_{3/2}$ ($\text{F}^{'}$=5) , and Rydberg state ($n\text{P}_{3/2}$ ($\text{m}_\text{J}$=+3/2)) is theoretically modeled to analyze the nonlinear dependence of the AT doublet's asymmetry and interval on the cooling laser detuning. Experiments reveal that as the cooling laser detuning $\Delta_1$ decreases from $-$15 MHz to $-$10 MHz, the AT doublet exhibits increasing symmetry, while its interval shows a nonlinear decrease. Theoretical simulations based on the density matrix equation and Lindblad master equation align closely with experimental data, confirming the model's validity. This study provides insights into quantum interference dynamics in multi-level systems and offers a systematic approach for optimizing precision measurements in cold atom spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Generating isolated elliptically polarized attosecond pulse in gapped graphene using linearly polarized laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the two-band density-matrix equations to calculate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and its ellipticity in gapped graphene irradiated by a femtosecond short-pulse laser under different orientation angles. The orientation-dependent harmonic spectra show obvious enhancement harmonics. We also focus on the ellipticity of these enhanced harmonics. Utilizing the recombination trajectory model, the enhanced harmonics are attributed to the caustic effect, whose orientation dependence originates from the inequivalence of $\textrm{K}$ points during the electron ionization process for different orientation angles. In addition, the harmonic ellipticity can be well understood by the phase difference of saddle-point currents. Based on our theory, we design a two-color field scheme to generate elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in gapped graphene. This work may shed light on the generation of elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <title>Laser power stabilization using conservation law in acoustic optic modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13447</link>

Abstract: Laser power stabilization plays an important role in modern precision instruments based on atom-laser interactions. Here we demonstrate an alternative active control method of laser power utilizing the conservation law in an acoustic optic modulator (AOM). By adjusting the 1st order beam power to dynamically follow the fluctuation of the total power of all diffraction beams, the 0th order application beam as the difference term, is stabilized. Experimental result demonstrates that the relative power noise of the controlled application beam is reduced by a factor of 200, reaching $4 \times 10^{-6} $ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 10$^{-4}$ Hz compared with the uncontrolled total power. Allan deviation shows that the application beam reaches a relative power instability of 3.28$\times 10^{-6}$ at 500 s averaging time. In addition, the method allows a high availability of total power source. The method opens a new way of laser power stabilization and shall be very useful in applications such as atomic clocks, laser interferometers and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of interacting bosons with propagating waveguide photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</description>
