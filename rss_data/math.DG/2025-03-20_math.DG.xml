      <title>On the first width of hyperbolic surfaces: multiplicity and lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian surface of negative curvature, we prove a characterization for configurations of closed geodesics arising from one parameter Allen-Cahn min-max constructions. One of the facts we conclude is that every geodesic occurs with multiplicity one. As an application we obtain a uniform sharp lower bound for the first min-max width of closed hyperbolic surfaces and prove it is only attained asymptotically. Moreover, we compute the first width of the Bolza surface and of some hyperbolic surfaces with small systoles.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity one 4-dimensional gradient Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simply-connected four-dimensional gradient Ricci solitons that are invariant under a compact cohomogeneity one group action have been studied extensively. However, the special case where the group is $SU(2)$ (the smallest possible example) has received comparatively little attention. The purpose of this article is to give a comprehensive study of simply-connected $SU(2)$-invariant expanding and shrinking cohomogeneity one gradient Ricci solitons. The first result is the construction of new 3-parameter families of complete $SU(2)$-invariant asymptotically conical expanding gradient Ricci solitons. New shrinking K\"ahler $U(2)$-invariant gradient Ricci solitons in dimension 4 with orbifold singularities are also constructed, leading to a classification of such metrics when the base space of the orbifold is a simply-connected smooth manifold. Finally, we highlight numerical evidence that all the compact cohomogeneity one shrinking gradient Ricci solitons are known.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic null curves in the special linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the theory of approximation for holomorphic null curves in the special linear group ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. In particular, we establish Runge, Mergelyan, Mittag-Leffler, and Carleman type theorems for the family of holomorphic null immersions $M\to{\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ from any open Riemann surface $M$. Our results include jet interpolation of Weierstrass type and approximation by embeddings, as well as global conditions on the approximating curves. As application, we show that every open Riemann surface admits a proper holomorphic null embedding into ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, and hence also a proper conformal immersion of constant mean curvature $1$ into hyperbolic 3-space. This settles a problem posed by Alarcon and Forstneric in 2015.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Grassmannians: plain, decorated, augmented</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decorated and augmented nonlinear Grassmannians can be used to parametrize coadjoint orbits of classical diffeomorphism groups. We provide a general framework for decoration and augmentation functors that facilitates the construction of a smooth structure on decorated or augmented nonlinear Grassmannians. This permits to equip the corresponding coadjoint orbits with the structure of a smooth symplectic Frechet manifold. The coadjoint orbits obtained in this way are not new. Here, we provide a uniform description of their smooth structures.</description>

      <title>Probing the topology of the space of tokens with structured prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a general and flexible method for prompting a large language model (LLM) to reveal its (hidden) token input embedding up to homeomorphism. Moreover, this article provides strong theoretical justification -- a mathematical proof for generic LLMs -- for why this method should be expected to work. With this method in hand, we demonstrate its effectiveness by recovering the token subspace of Llemma-7B. The results of this paper apply not only to LLMs but also to general nonlinear autoregressive processes.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for symmetric hyperbolic Partial Differential Operators on Complete Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a complete Riemannian manifold, as well as time independent smooth lower order terms appearing in a first order symmetric perturbation of a Riemannian wave operator can be uniquely recovered, up to the natural obstructions, from a local source to solution map of the respective hyperbolic initial value problem. Our proofs are based on an adaptation of the classical Boundary Control method (BC-method) originally developed by Belishev and Kurylev. The BC-method reduces the PDE-based problem to a purely geometric problem involving the so-called travel time data. For each point in the manifold the travel time data contains the distance function from this point to any point in a fixed \textit{a priori} known compact observation set. It is well known that this geometric problem is solvable. The main novelty of this paper lies in our strategy to recover the lower order terms via a further adaptation of the BC-method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the K\"ahler-hyperbolicity length of a bounded symmetric domain, defined by its rank and genus, as a unique constant determined by a constant gradient length of a special Bergman potential. Additionally, we establish a characterization of the lower bound of $L^\infty$ norm of the gradient length of any Bergman potential.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that a closed $n$-dimensional generalized $(\lambda, n+m)$-Einstein manifold of constant scalar curvature with weakly radially zero Ricci curvature is isometric to either a sphere ${\Bbb S}^n$, or a product ${\Bbb S}^{1} \times \Sigma^{n-1}$ of a circle with an $(n-1)$-dimensional Einstein manifold of positive Ricci curvature, up to finite cover and rescaling. Furthermore, if we assume $(M, g)$ has positive isotropic curvature, $M$ must be isometric to either a sphere ${\Bbb S}^n$, or a product ${\Bbb S}^{1} \times {\Bbb S}^{n-1}$ of a circle with an $(n-1)$-sphere.</description>

Abstract: We study a canonical class of perturbations of Dirac operators that are defined in any dimension and on any Hermitian Clifford module bundle. These operators generalize the 2-dimensional Jackiw-Rossi operator, which describes electronic excitations on topological superconductors. We also describe the low energy spectrum of these operators on complete surfaces, under mild hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Stability of fixed points in Poisson geometry and higher Lie theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a uniform approach to obtain sufficient criteria for a (higher order) fixed point of a given bracket structure on a manifold to be stable under deformations. Examples of bracket structures include Lie algebroids, Lie $n$-algebroids, singular foliations, Lie bialgebroids, Courant algebroids and Dirac structures in split Courant algebroids admitting a Dirac complement. We show that the stability problems are specific instances of the following problem: given a differential graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, a differential graded Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak h$ of degreewise finite codimension in $\mathfrak g$ and a Maurer-Cartan element $Q\in \mathfrak h^1$, when are Maurer-Cartan elements near $Q$ in $\mathfrak g$ gauge equivalent to elements of $\mathfrak h^1$? We show that the vanishing of a finite-dimensional cohomology group associated to $\mathfrak g,\mathfrak h$ and $Q$ implies a positive answer to the question above, and therefore implies stability of fixed points of the geometric structures described above. In particular, we recover the stability results of Crainic-Fernandes for zero-dimensional leaves, as well as the stability results for higher order singularities of Dufour-Wade.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense discontinuous surface groups for reductive symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G/H$ be a homogeneous space of reductive type with non-compact $H$. The study of deformations of discontinuous groups for $G/H$ was initiated by T.~Kobayashi. In this paper, we show that a standard discontinuous group $\Gamma$ admits a non-standard small deformation as a discontinuous group for $G/H$ if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to a surface group of high genus and its Zariski closure is locally isomorphic to $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. Furthermore, we also prove that if $G/H$ is a symmetric space and admits some non virtually abelian discontinuous groups, then $G$ contains a Zariski-dense discrete surface subgroup of high genus acting properly discontinuously on $G/H$. As a key part of our proofs, we show that for a discrete surface subgroup $\Gamma$ of high genus contained in a reductive group $G$, if the Zariski closure of $\Gamma$ is locally isomorphic to $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, then $\Gamma$ admits a small deformation in $G$ whose Zariski closure is a reductive subgroup of the same real rank as $G$.</description>

      <title>Some applications of canonical metrics to Landau-Ginzburg models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that a given smooth del Pezzo surface or Fano threefold $X$ admits a choice of log Calabi-Yau compactified mirror toric Landau-Ginzburg model (with respect to certain fixed K\"ahler classes and Gorenstein toric degenerations). Here we consider the problem of constructing a corresponding map $\Theta$ from a domain in the complexified K\"ahler cone of $X$ to a well-defined, separated moduli space $\mathfrak{M}$ of polarised manifolds endowed with a canonical metric. We prove a complete result for del Pezzos and a partial result for some special Fano threefolds. The construction uses some fundamental results in the theory of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. As a consequence $\mathfrak{M}$ parametrises $K$-stable manifolds and the domain of $\Theta$ is endowed with the pullback of a Weil-Petersson form.</description>

      <title>Horizon classification via Riemannian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>
