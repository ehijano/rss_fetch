      <title>Monitoring the Period Variation of KR Cyg Eclipsing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the period variation of the eclipsing binary system KR Cyg, a near-contact binary characterized by its short orbital period and significant stellar interactions. The precise orbital parameters of the system have been determined through light curve data collected periodically since 1999 and were published in our previous studies. Additionally, minimum light observations have been continuously monitored to analyze the period variation of the system. In our earlier work, the masses of the primary and secondary components were determined as $2.88\pm0.20 M_{\odot}$ and $1.26\pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$, with corresponding radii of $2.59\pm 0.06 R_{\odot}$ and $1.80\pm 0.04 R_{\odot}$. The bolometric albedo and effective temperature of the less massive star were also investigated, and deviations caused by mutual illumination effects were identified. These results provide valuable insights into the evolutionary status of KR Cyg and shed light on the dynamic processes that occur in near-contact binary systems. Using updated eclipse timings, an (O-C) diagram was constructed, revealing both long-term trends and periodic oscillations. These cyclical variations are thought to indicate the presence of a tertiary component affecting the system via the light-time effect. Additional observations and modeling are recommended to confirm the tertiary hypothesis and further refine the parameters of the system.</description>

      <title>The slow brightening of WNTR23bzdiq / WTP19aalzlk : Possible onset of common-envelope evolution in an asymptotic giant branch star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present WNTR23bzdiq/WTP19aalzlk, a slow eruption of an early-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in M31 identified by the Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) near-infrared and the NEOWISE mid-infrared surveyors. This source brightened gradually over seven years: a 0.5-mag optical rise (2018-2021), a 1-mag optical outburst lasting $\sim$1000 days (2021-2023), and another 1-mag optical rebrightening in 2024. This was accompanied by a steady mid-IR brightening of 1-mag over ten years in NEOWISE data. Archival optical data show only erratic, small amplitude ($&lt;0.3$\,mag) brightness variations from 2003 to 2015, revealing a progenitor star with T$_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3500$K and L $\approx1.6\times10^{4}$L$_{\odot}$ - consistent with a 7$\pm$2M$_{\odot}$ star in its early-AGB phase. During the eruption, the luminosity rose to $\approx5\times10^{4}$L$_{\odot}$ with slow photospheric expansion ($\approx5$km-s$^{-1}$) and constant temperatures ($\approx3600$K) inferred from the spectral energy distribution. Optical and NIR spectra of the eruption resemble late M-type stars, with a mixed-temperature behavior - transitioning from M1 in the optical to M7/M8 in the NIR. These properties of WNTR23bzdiq resemble those of stellar merger transients, particularly the giant star merger OGLE-2002-BLG-360, but on longer timescales. As such, WNTR23bzdiq potentially marks the onset of common-envelope evolution (CEE) in a binary with an AGB primary, and is possibly a member of the emerging population of infrared transients from CEE in giant stars. Continued multiwavelength monitoring, particularly mid-IR observations with JWST to quantify dust production, will shed further light on WNTR23bzdiq.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of magnetic field in 3D NLTE inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe our approach to solve the problem of ensuring the solenoidality of the magnetic field vector in three-dimensional (3D) inversions, as well as the estimation of the uncertainty in the inferred magnetic field. The solenoidality of the magnetic field vector is often disregarded in the inversion of spectropolarimetric data due to limitations in the traditional one-dimensional inversion techniques. We propose a method to ensure the solenoidal condition in 3D inversions based on our meshfree approach. The increase in dimensionality with respect to the 1D inversion techniques is such that some of the traditional methods to determine the uncertainties become unfeasible. We propose a method based on a Monte Carlo approach to determine the uncertainty of the magnetic field inference. Due to the physics of the problem, we can compute the uncertainty increasing the total required computational time by just a factor of about two. We also propose a metric to quantify the uncertainty to describe the degree of confidence of the magnetic field inference. Finally, we perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of both the method and the metric proposed to quantify the uncertainty.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy of the Dust-Obscured Metal-Poor Open Cluster Trumpler 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trumpler 5 is a moderately old, dust-obscured metal-poor open cluster. In this study, high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic data of seven giant stars from the Trumpler 5 cluster were analyzed to derive chemical abundances for 20 elements and $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. Color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis of BV and Gaia photometry has also been performed for a comprehensive study of the cluster. Thanks to the methodology employed, some targets are studied for the first time. Additionally, it provides a detailed color-magnitude diagram analysis using photometric and spectroscopic data. We gathered high-resolution spectra for seven Trumpler 5 red giants in the near-infrared H and K wavelength domains, using the Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS). We introduced a method to initially estimate the stellar surface gravity (log g) by using calibrated equivalent widths of the Ti II line at 15873 {\AA} from a large sample. We performed standard spectroscopic analyses to refine the model atmospheric parameters of our targets and determined the chemical abundances primarily through spectrum synthesis. We also performed color-magnitude diagram analyses to extract differential reddening correction to compare cluster parameters both with and without corrections. We derived stellar parameters for seven members of Trumpler 5 with our method and the results are consistent with both the literature and other methods. We also inferred elemental abundances for more than 20 species, along with the $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. The elemental abundances are in good agreement with the literature values for similar targets. Through CMD analysis, we found the reddening value, E(B-V)$\simeq$0.76 and estimated the age of the cluster to be approximately 2.50 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Strontium I, III, IV and V: Electron Impact Excitation Data for Kilonovae and White Dwarf Diagnostic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strontium (Sr) emissions have been observed across a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from kilonovae (KNe) events to white dwarf (WD) stars. Precise and extensive atomic data for low ionisation stages of Sr is required for accurate theoretical modelling and to improve our understanding of evolutionary pathways. We calculated energy levels, Einstein A coefficients and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for Sr I, Sr III, Sr IV and Sr V at the temperature and density ranges of interest in KNe and WD research. We developed new target structures using the GRASP0 and AUTOSTRUCTURE packages. The energies and A-values arising from the new structures were found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical equivalents reported in the literature. Maxwellian averaged electron impact collision strengths were calculated using the R-matrix approach, as applied through the DARC and RMBP coding packages. These are presented in adf04 file format. The new data sets allowed us to construct synthetic spectra for the first five ionisation stages of Sr and probe possible density and temperature diagnostic lines. The synthetic spectra within the KNe regime revealed possible Sr IV and Sr V candidate lines at 1027.69nm and 1203.35nm respectively. These may provide useful benchmarks for determining the extent of Sr ionisation that can be reached in an evolving KNe event. Additional diagnostic lines were found to be poor across the Sr ion stages for both KNe and WD regimes due to most levels being in either coronal or Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved centrifugal magnetosphere caught in motion around the secondary component of $\rho$ Oph A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered spectroscopic binary $\rho$ Oph A is a rare magnetic hot binary system composed of two early B-type stars, comprising a non-magnetic primary (Aa) and a slightly less massive magnetic secondary (Ab). Using near-IR interferometry, we aim to resolve the system's astrometric orbit. The high-spectral resolution VLTI/GRAVITY data also enables obtaining further information about the two stellar components, and about the centrifugal magnetosphere orbiting the magnetic star. We obtained a time-series of $K$-band interferometric data from VLTI/GRAVITY, and analyzed them with the geometrical model-fitting tool PMOIRED. The continuum was used to derive the relative astrometry and relative fluxes of the two components, leading to the astrometric orbital solution. Spectro-interferometry covering the Br$\gamma$ line was then used to obtain high-angular-resolution information about the dominant magnetospheric cloud in corotation with the magnetic Ab component. The combination of the astrometric orbital solution with the published radial velocities for both components led to a 3-dimensional orbital solution, dynamical masses, and a dynamical parallax, revealing a good agreement with previous estimates and confirming the previously inferred alignment of the orbital axis and the rotation axis of the Ab component, albeit at a much higher precision. Detailed analysis of the Br$\gamma$ spectrointerferometry then revealed the changing position of the magnetospheric cloud relative to the Ab component. Comparison to the location of the cloud predicted from $\rho$ Oph Ab's oblique rotator model and H$\alpha$ emission properties demonstrated excellent agreement. We are additionally able to demonstrate that the magnetic star exhibits prograde rotation. This represents the first time that the motion of a centrifugal magnetosphere has been detected in angularly resolved observations.</description>

      <title>A new approach for predicting the stability of hierarchical triple systems -- I. Coplanar Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical triple systems play a crucial role in various astrophysical contexts, and therefore the understanding of their stability is important. Traditional empirical stability criteria rely on a threshold value of $Q$, the ratio between the outer orbit's pericenter distance and the inner orbit's semi-major axis. However, determining a single critical value of $Q$ is impossible because there is a range of the value of $Q$ for which both stable and unstable systems exist, referred to as the mixed-region. In this study, we introduce a novel method to assess the stability of triple systems within this mixed-region. We numerically integrate equal-mass, coplanar hierarchical triples within the mixed-region. By performing Fourier analysis of the time evolution of the semi-major axes ratio during the first 1000 inner orbital periods of the systems, we find notable features in stable systems: if the main peaks are periodically spaced in the frequency domain and the continuous components and irregularly spaced peaks are small, the system tends to be stable. This observation indicates that the evolution of stable triples is more periodic than that of unstable ones. We quantified the periodicity of the triples and investigated the correlation between the Fourier power distribution and the system's lifetime. Using this correlation, we show that it is possible to determine if a triple system in the mixed-region is stable or not with very high accuracy. These findings suggest that periodicity in orbital evolution can serve as a robust indicator of stability for hierarchical triples.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of the equations of turbulent convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the efficiency and ease-of-use of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and Sparse Physics-Informed Discovery of Empirical Relations (SPIDER) framework in recovering the relevant governing equations and boundary conditions from data generated by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent convective flows. In the former case, a weak-form implementation pySINDy is used. Time-dependent data for two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) DNS simulation of Rayleigh-Benard convection and convective plane Couette flow is generated using the Dedalus PDE framework for spectrally solving differential equations. Using pySINDy we are able to recover the governing equations of 2D models of Rayleigh-Benard convection at Rayleigh numbers, R, from laminar, through transitional to moderately turbulent flow conditions, albeit with increasing difficulty with larger Rayleigh number, especially in recovery of the diffusive terms (with coefficient magnitude proportional to 1/R^0.5). SPIDER requires a much smaller library of terms and we are able to recover more easily the governing equations for a wider range of R in 2D and 3D convection and plane flow models and go on to recover constraints (the incompressibility condition) and boundary conditions, demonstrating the benefits and capabilities of SPIDER to go beyond pySINDy for these fluid problems governed by second-order PDEs. [We] demonstrat[e] the potential of machine-learning methods to validate numerical solvers and solutions for such flow problems. We also find that properties of the flow, specifically the correlation time and spatial scales, should inform the initial selection of spatiotemporal subdomain sizes [abbreviated]</description>

      <title>Enhanced Mass Loss of Very Massive Stars: Impact on the Evolution, Binary Processes, and Remnant Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMS) play a fundamental role in astrophysics due to their winds and supernovae (SN), and their role as massive black hole (BH) progenitors. However, their origin and evolution remain a significant challenge. Recent theoretical work and observations suggest that VMS approaching the Eddington limit may experience mass loss above the standard wind predictions. This study investigates how enhanced winds influence single and binary VMS evolution, observable properties, and resulting BH populations. New stellar wind prescriptions, sensitive to the Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and the luminosity-to-mass ratio, were implemented into the stellar evolution code PARSEC v2.0. These updated single-star tracks (100 - 600 M$_{\odot}$ at Z=0.006) were used to model the VMS population in the Tarantula Nebula and integrated into the SEVN binary evolution code. The $\Gamma_e$-enhanced single-star tracks match observed VMS properties better than standard models. Explaining the most massive star, R136a1, through a single-star origin suggests a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass limit of $&lt;$ 400 M$_{\odot}$ regardless of the wind recipe used. However, binary stellar mergers also offer a suitable origin for R136a1 and other observed VMS, potentially lowering the upper ZAMS mass limit by ~100 M$_{\odot}$. In binaries, enhanced winds inhibit main-sequence stellar mergers and limit BH production above the pair-instability mass gap's lower edge (~50 M$_{\odot}$). Binary BHs merging in a Hubble time with enhanced winds yield more primary BHs above 30 M$_{\odot}$ and enable secondary BHs between 30-40 solar masses, a range not found with standard stellar winds at LMC metallicity. This study highlights the crucial role that stellar winds and binary interactions play in VMS evolution and offers predictions relevant for interpreting VMS observations and gravitational wave source origins.</description>

      <title>Imaging and spectropolarimetric observations of a band-split type II solar radio burst with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II solar radio bursts are generated by electrons accelerated by coronal shock waves. They appear in dynamic spectra as lanes drifting from higher to lower frequencies at the plasma frequency and its harmonic. These lanes can often be split into two or more sub-bands that have similar drift rates. This phenomenon is called band-splitting, and its physical origins are still under debate. Our aim is to investigate the origin of band-splitting using novel imaging and spectropolarimetric observations of a type II solar radio burst from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We used LOFAR imaging at multiple frequencies and time steps to track the locations of the radio sources corresponding to the two components of the band-split emission lane. In addition, we estimated the degree of circular polarisation (dcp) for both components using LOFAR's full Stokes dynamic spectra. From the imaging of the type II burst, we found two close but clearly separated emission regions clustered over several frequencies spanning each split band. One emission region corresponds to the lower frequency band and the other to the higher frequency band of the split lane. Using the full Stokes dynamic spectra, we also found the dcp to be very similar for both bands. The two distinct emission regions suggest that the split bands originate from two separate regions at the shock. The similar values of dcp for both sub-bands correspond to similar values of magnetic field strength in the two regions and indicate little to no change in the emission region plasma. Thus, our findings are in contradiction with previous theories, which have suggested that split bands originate in the same region but upstream and downstream of the shock. Instead, our results suggest that both bands originate in two separate upstream regions since we find a clear separation in locations and no magnetic compression.</description>

      <title>A hybrid SLAM-Payne framework for atmospheric parameter and abundance determination of early-type Stars from LAMOST DR9 low-resolution Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-type stars are key drivers of Galactic chemical evolution, enriching the interstellar medium with alpha elements through powerful stellar winds and core-collapse supernovae, fueled by their short lifetimes and high masses. However, their spectra remain challenging to analyse due to rapid rotation, weak metal lines, and non-LTE effects. While large spectroscopic surveys provide extensive low-resolution data, extracting reliable parameters remains difficult due to methodological limitations for hot stars. Our goal is to develop a unified framework combining data-driven and synthetic spectral approaches to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for hot stars using low-resolution spectra, addressing limitations in current methodologies while retaining critical spectral information. We present a hybrid approach integrating the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) and the Payne frameworks, for low-resolution ($R\sim 1800$) spectra from LAMOST DR9. Our method preserves full spectral information including Balmer series and metal-line blends, employing neural-network interpolation for efficient parameter estimation ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, and $v\sin i$) and abundance determination for O, Mg, Si, and Fe, across 8000 - 20000 K. We derive stellar parameters and abundances for 315,822 stars with $\mathrm{SNR} \geqslant 10$ in the $r$-band. Additionally, we detect abundance trends ([$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]) that exhibit temperature-dependent systematics and a distinct $\alpha$-poor stellar population within $0.0 \leqslant \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leqslant 0.5$ dex. The radial abundance gradients are negative and consistent with that derived from Cepheids, with a slope of $-0.070\pm0.007$ in \feh in the region $6 \leqslant R_\mathrm{GC}\leqslant 15$ kpc.</description>

Mediated by the magnetic field of the white dwarf, their spin and binary orbit are (mostly) synchronized. They play an important role in our understanding of close binary evolution and the generation of strong magnetic fields in white dwarfs. Thanks to X-ray all-sky surveys, optical variability, and spectroscopic surveys, the number of polars and LARPs has grown from just a few in the 1980s to more than 200 today. Follow-up studies are facilitated by the systematic compilation of these systems presented here, which is also made available as an online resource. Yearly updates are planned, and community input is highly appreciated.</description>

      <title>Observations of a New Form of Partial Filament Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and coronal jets are two of the best-studied forms of solar eruptions, with the same underlying physics. Previous studies have presented partial eruptions producing coronal jets. We report, for the first time, a detailed analysis of three partial eruptions that segmented after the eruption began and produced CMEs. We use multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory, and Solar Orbiter to reconstruct the three-dimensional evolution of the events. The magnetic field extrapolations indicated that the initial filaments were overlaid by pseudostreamer structures, and the splitting occurred after the interaction between the filament-supporting flux and external open field through their null points. The breakout mechanism seems to play a key role in both halting the system and splitting it. However, this initial evolution and consequent splitting into an erupting flux rope above the prominence segment that failed to erupt poses severe challenges to theories of solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum relaxation in models of rotating early-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational evolution of stars is still an open question of stellar physics because of the numerous phenomena that can contribute to the distribution of angular momentum. This paper aims at determining the time scale over which a rotating early-type star relaxes to a steady baroclinic state or, equivalently, in which case its nuclear evolution is slow enough to let the evolution of the star be modelled by a series of quasi-steady states. We investigate the damping time scale of baroclinic and viscous eigenmodes that are potentially excited by the continuous forcing of nuclear evolution. We first investigate this problem with a spherical Boussinesq model. Since much of the dynamics is concentrated in the radiative envelope of the star, we then improve the realism of the modelling by using a polytropic model of the envelope that takes into account a realistic density profile. The polytropic model of the envelope underlines the key role of the region at the core-envelope interface. The results of evolutionary models recently obtained with two-dimensional axisymmetric ESTER models turn out to be a consequence of the slow damping of viscous modes. Using a vanishing Prandtl number appears to be too strong an approximation to explain the dynamics of the models. Baroclinic modes previously thought as good candidates of this relaxation process turn out to be too quickly damped. The dynamical response of rotating stars to the slow forcing of its nuclear evolution appears as a complex combination of non-oscillating eigenmodes. Simple Boussinesq approach are not realistic enough to explain this reality. The present work underlines the key role of layers near the core-envelope interface in an early-type star and also the key role of any angular momentum transport mechanism, here played by viscosity, for early-type stars to reach critical rotation, presumably associated with the Be phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Measuring Long Stellar Rotation Periods (&gt;10 days) from TESS FFI Light Curves is Possible: An Investigation Using TESS and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation period of a star is an important quantity that provides insight into its structure and state. For stars with surface features like starspots, their periods can be inferred from brightness variations as these features move across the stellar surface. TESS, with its all-sky coverage, is providing the largest sample of stars for obtaining rotation periods. However, most of the periods have been limited to shorter than the 13.7-day TESS orbital period due to strong background signals (e.g., scattered light) on those timescales. In this study, we investigated the viability of measuring longer periods (&gt; 10 days) from TESS light curves for stars in the Northern Continuous Viewing Zone (NCVZ). We first created a reference set of 272 period measurements longer than 10 days for K &amp; M dwarfs in the NCVZ using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) that we consider as the "ground truth" given ZTF's long temporal baseline of 6+ years. We then used the unpopular pipeline to de-trend TESS light curves and implemented a modified Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram that accounts for flux offsets between observing sectors. For 179 out of the 272 sources (66%), the TESS-derived periods match the ZTF-derived periods to within 10%. The match rate increases to 81% (137 out of 170) when restricting to sources with a TESS LS power that exceeds a threshold. Our results confirm the capability of measuring periods longer than 10 days from TESS data, highlighting the dataset's potential for studying slow rotators.</description>

      <title>Operational and Exploration Requirements and Research Capabilities for SEP Environment Monitoring and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating risks posed by solar energetic particles (SEPs) to operations and exploration in space and Earth's atmosphere motivates the development of advanced, synergistic approaches for monitoring, modeling, and analyzing space weather conditions. The consequences of SEPs and their interactions with the near-Earth space environment are numerous, including elevated radiation levels at aviation altitudes during major events, satellite damage, and health risks to astronauts, resulting in economic impacts and potential hazards for space exploration. This contribution will present a high-level overview of the operational requirements and research capabilities for SEP event environment monitoring and forecasting that were highlighted during a workshop at Georgia State University, held on October 16-19, 2024. Specifically, it summarizes the presented activities concerning the following: (1) Identifying needs for SEP event forecasting and nowcasting, including practical forecast timeframes; (2) Reviewing availability and coverage of the current observational data and identifying tangible data resources for research, operations and the R2O2R loop; (3) Mapping existing forecast capabilities and identifying meaningful modeling advances for research and operations.</description>

      <title>Digging Deeper for RR Lyrae Stars with Low Modulation Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the goal of searching for very low modulation amplitudes among fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and assess their incidence rate, we performed a survey of 36 stars observed by the Kepler satellite during the entire four-year period of its mission. The search was conducted by a task-oriented code, designed to find low-amplitude signals in the presence of high-amplitude components and instrumental systematics. We found 7 new modulated stars and negate one earlier claimed star, whereby increasing the number of known Blazhko stars from 17 to 24 and yielding an observed occurrence rate of 67% for the Kepler field. Six of the new stars have the lowest modulation amplitudes found so far, with ~250 ppm Fourier side-lobe amplitudes near the fundamental mode frequency. Because of the small sample size in the Kepler field, we extended the survey to 12 campaign fields observed by K2, the ``two-wheeled'' mission of Kepler. From the 1061 stars we found 514 Blazhko stars. After correcting for the short duration of the time spent on each field, and for the noise dependence of the detections, we arrived at an underlying occurrence rate of ~75% - likely a lower limit for the true rate of Blazhko stars in the K2 fields.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Recurrent Nova M31N 2008-12a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near infrared (NIR) 0.9--2.5$\mu$m spectra of the remarkable recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a were obtained on days 6.3 and 10.3 after discovery of its 2024 outburst, and are the first NIR spectra of this object. The only prominent line seen in the spectra is that of HeI 1.083$\mu$m, on day 6.3. Apart from this HeI line, there are only two other weak emission features: one at 1.0786$\mu$m, suggested to be the [FeXIII] 1.075$\mu$m coronal line, and one unidentified feature at 1.0969$\mu$m. The observed full width at half maximum of the HeI line on day 6.3 (1350 km s$^{-1}$) is consistent with the behaviour of optical HeI lines during earlier eruptions of this RN, which show that the nova ejecta decelerate as they interact with the secondary's wind. The HeI 1.083$\mu$m line faded rapidly, and was absent in the day 10.3 spectrum, along with any other emission lines. We use the relative strengths of optical He and H lines in previous eruptions to estimate the expected strengths of the HeI 1.083$\mu$m line and of other infrared (including coronal) lines at 6.3 days after eruption. Our findings are consistent with the infrared spectra we observed during the 2024 eruption. We apply our analysis to account for the relative weakness of NIR coronal emission in known Galactic recurrent novae with giant secondaries.</description>

      <title>Recurrent eruptions from the emergence of a toroidal flux tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar eruptive behavior is often modeled with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetic flux emergence. The usual geometry considered is that of a horizontal cylindrical magnetic flux tube. An alternative is the toroidal tube geometry which has some advantages over the cylindrical one, namely, that the emerging bipolar pair of sunspots do not drift apart indefinitely. In addition to the toroidal tube, we include an oblique, ambient field in the simulation, which leads to the production of increased activity from the interaction of ambient and emerging fields. Letting the simulation run for a long time reveals that six eruptive jets take place after an initial reconnection jet. In an attempt to better understand the eruptive activity we examine the evolution of free energy and relative helicity of the coronal volume, as well as, the magnetic tension forces acting on the magnetic system. We find that all quantities decrease in magnitude during the eruptive jets and rebuild afterwards. This recurrent activity continues even after flux emergence ceases and stops once the examined quantities saturate to nearly constant values.</description>

      <title>The Relationship between the Kinematics of Coronal Mass Ejections and the Brightness of the Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation into an apparent relationship between white-light coronal brightness and the kinematics of flare-associated CMEs. Using a unique dataset known as the LASCO Coronal Brightness Index (CBI), we conduct a study that explores the brightness in the lower solar corona and its relationship to the velocity of flare-associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We analyze all M- and X-class flares that take place on or near the limbs of the Earth-facing disk of the Sun between 1996 and 2022, determine if these flares are associated with CMEs, and record the projection-corrected velocity of the eruptions if they occurred. Using the CBI dataset, we evaluate the brightness in the corona directly overlying the flare source locations between 2.4 and 6.2 solar radii, and find that above a certain level of coronal brightness, the likelihood of a high-velocity CME significantly decreases. This result implies coronal brightness could be an important indicator of the kinematics of solar CMEs. We also highlight and discuss the unique nature of Active Region (AR) 12192 in 2014, observing that its unprecedented overlying coronal brightness may be related to the low CME productivity of that region.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue of Ultracompact Mass-Transferring White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview and catalogue of all known mass-transferring binary systems that have white dwarf accretors and orbital periods shorter than 70 minutes, including the AM CVn-type binary systems and a number of related objects. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature background and describe recent breakthroughs, open questions, and connections to other fields. This overview is intended to provide a starting point for researchers who are relatively new to the fields of ultracompact binaries or AM CVn-type binaries. We define the scope of the catalogue (the criteria for inclusion) and describe its format and contents (what data have been included for each target). We also summarise the observed properties of the known mass-transferring ultracompact binaries, including their orbital periods and component stellar masses and radii. The catalogue presented here aims to provide a central resource to enable researchers to track the current status of the known sample. At the time of writing, the catalogue includes 123 confirmed binaries and 29 candidates. The catalogue is hosted on a public platform (Zenodo) with version control, and will be updated regularly.</description>

      <title>Mass, Gas, and Gauss around a T Tauri Star with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of young planets help us understand planet evolution and investigate important evolutionary processes such as atmospheric escape. We monitored IRAS 04125+2902, a 3 Myr-old T Tauri star with a transiting planet and a transitional disk, with the SPIRou infrared spectropolarimeter on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Using these data, we constrained the mass and density of the Jupiter-size companion to &lt;0.16 M_J and &lt;0.23 g/cm^3, respectively (90\% upper limits). These rule out a Jovian-like object and support the hypothesis that it is an ancestor to the numerous sub-Neptunes found around mature stars. We unambiguously detect magnetic fields at the stellar surface, small-scale fields reaching 1.5 kG and the large-scale field mostly consisting of a 0.80-0.95 kG dipole inclined by 5-15deg to the rotation axis. Accretion onto the star is low and/or episodic at a maximum rate of ~10^{-11} Msun/yr, indicating that IRAS 04125+2902 is most likely in a magnetic 'propeller' regime, possibly maintaining the star's slow rotation (11.3~d). We discover persistent Doppler-shifted absorption in a metastable He I line, clear evidence for a magnetized wind from a gaseous inner disk. Variability in absorption suggests structure in the disk wind that could reflect disk-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization in SN 1006 southwest shows spatial variations and differences with the radio band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of a spatial variation of X-ray polarization in the southwestern shell of SN 1006 (SN 1006 SW) using IXPE. The shell has an average X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $21.6\%\pm 4.5\%$ and polarization angle (PA) of $-48^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--4 keV energy band, similar to those in the northeastern shell. The PD varies along SN 1006 SW, with a peak PD$= 40\%\pm 8\%$ in the south and a significantly lower PD $\lesssim 27\%$ (99\% upper limit) in the west where the shell has been proposed to be interacting with an interstellar cloud. The correlation between the PD, which reflects the magnetic orderliness, and the preshock density provides observational evidence that magnetic turbulence and amplification are environment-dependent. The high PD detected in the southern region of the shell constrains the magnetic turbulence scale of $\lesssim 0.1$~pc. Moreover, by comparing the IXPE X-ray and MeerKAT radio polarization measurements for SN 1006 SW, we found that magnetic fields traced by X-ray polarization are nearly radially distributed, whereas those traced by radio polarization tend to follow a direction parallel to the Galactic plane. This suggests that the X-ray polarization probes freshly amplified magnetic fields from small-scale structures in the immediate postshock region, while the radio traces more extended regions influenced by the pre-existing ambient magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: This review article delves into the study of low-mass exoplanets: super-Earths, mini-Neptunes and the new categories within and between that we are starting to discover. We provide an overview of current exoplanet observational capabilities, their limitations, and what they are allowing us to learn about low-mass planets. We briefly summarize the most important aspects of planet formation, with an emphasis on processes that may be testable with small exoplanets, in particular those that affect their composition. We also describe the observed compositional diversity of low-mass exoplanets and what it teaches us about planet formation pathways. We finish this review summarizing the study of the composition of small exoplanets during the very last stage of stellar evolution, by studying white dwarfs. This review is written as the JWST is making its first contributions to small planet characterization, rapidly opening new lines of inquiry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dust dynamics in the molecular outflow using an analytical magnetohydrodynamical outflow model. Specifically, we investigate the maximum size of dust grains $a_{\rm d,max}$ that can be lifted by the outflow and whether they can escape into interstellar space. We also investigate the dependence of the maximum size of the dust grains on various outflow parameters, such as the mass ejection rate of the outflow $\dot{M}$, the disk size $r_{\rm disk}$, the mass of the central protostar $M_{*}$ and the internal dust density $\rho_{\rm mat}$. We find the empirical formula for the maximum dust size as a function of the outflow parameters. $a_{\rm d,max}$ depends on the parameters as $a_{\rm d,max}$ $\propto$ $\dot{M}^{1.0}$ $r_{\rm disk}^{-0.44}$ $M_{*}^{-0.82}$ $\rho_{\rm mat}^{-1.0}$. We also find that the dust grains with size of 100 $\rm \mu$m to 1 mm can be lifted by the outflow and can distribute in the well outside of the disk when the mass ejection rate of the outflow has the value of $10^{-7}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$. This result is consistent with recent observations that show a correlation between the mass ejection rate of the outflow and the spectral index $\beta$ of the dust opacity at the envelope scale.</description>

      <title>Non-transiting exoplanets as a means to understand star-planet interactions in close-in systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies showed evidence of a dearth of close-in exoplanets around fast rotators, which can be explained by the combined action of intense tidal and magnetic interactions between planet and their host star. Detecting more exoplanets experiencing such interactions, with orbits evolving on short timescales, is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. For this purpose, we perform a new search for close-in non-transiting substellar companions in the Kepler data, focusing on orbital periods below 2.3 days. We focus on main-sequence solar-type stars and subgiant stars for which a surface rotation period was measured. For each star, we look for an excess in the power spectral density of the light curve, that could correspond to the signature of a close-in non-transiting companion. We compare our candidates with existing catalogues to eliminate potential contaminants in our sample, and we visually inspect the phase-folded light curve and its wavelet decomposition. We identify 88 stars, exhibiting a signature consistent with the presence of a close non-transiting substellar companion. We show that the objects in our sample are located mostly within the dearth zone, emphasising the importance of performing follow-up of such systems in order to gather observational evidence of star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>An Eccentric Sub-Neptune Moving Into the Evaporation Desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though missions such as Kepler, K2, and TESS have discovered $&gt;$2,000 sub-Neptune and Neptunian planets, there is a dearth of such planets at close-in (P$\lesssim$3 days) orbits. This feature, called the Neptune desert or the evaporation desert, is believed to be primarily shaped by planetary migration and photoevaporation. However, this region is not completely devoid of planets--a small number of very hot Neptunes reside within the desert. These planets provide an opportunity to directly probe the effects of migration and photoevaporation. We present confirmation of TOI-5800 b, an eccentric sub-Neptune on a $\approx$2.6 day period that is likely actively undergoing tidal migration. We use radial velocity measurements from the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) to constrain TOI-5800 b's mass and eccentricity. We find that it has an unusually high eccentricity (0.39$\pm$0.07) for its short orbit. TOI-5800 is therefore currently experiencing high levels of tidal heating as it moves into the desert. Ranked as a top candidate for transmission and emission spectroscopy within its temperature and radius regime, TOI-5800 b is a prime target for atmospheric characterization with JWST. TOI-5800 b presents a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of a planet undergoing tidal heating and to probe the composition of sub-Neptune planets.</description>

      <title>Searching for Accreting Compact Binaries in eROSITA DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact binary candidates in the eROSITA DR1 by combining Gaia astrometry and ZTF time-domain photometry. We select accreting compact binary candidates whose X-ray emission is likely accretion-driven, based on their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, and further identify systems with short-period ZTF light curves, thereby ruling out AGNs. The resulting 22 candidates, including two known compact binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature and explore their physical properties. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and optical color, and time-domain photometry in selecting accreting compact binaries. The method is scalable and adaptable to future multi-wavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact binaries in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Too fast to be single: Tidal evolution and photometric identification of stellar and planetary companions</title>

Abstract: Many stars, including those in binary or multiple systems, exhibit modified rotational evolution due to tidal interactions. While magnetic braking slows rotation in single stars, close binaries experience synchronization from tidal forces, resulting in high spin rates. Thus, fast rotators often signify synchronized binaries or planetary systems. We analyze stellar rotation in the Kepler field to photometrically identify non-single systems. Establishing an initial rotation-temperature relationship for individual stars via young clusters, we confirm our findings through magnitude excess and prior binary star system studies. Stars rotating faster than this relationship display a bimodal distribution in peculiar velocity, indicative of non-single or young stars. Leveraging this, we separate non-single stars when peculiar velocity is measurable, or estimate likelihood for those without. Our method identifies 2229 potential non-single star systems with rotation periods exceeding 3 days. For ultra-fast rotators ($P_{rot} &lt; 3 days$), we compile a catalog of 1518 ultra-short-period binary candidates, often part of hierarchical triples, reinforcing rapid spin's association with multiplicity. Applying our method to planet-host stars uncovers Kepler-1184 as a potential circumbinary system and identifies Kepler-493 and Kepler-957 potentially synchronized by close-in planets, with three others as potential false positives. Analysis of known non-single stars reveals clear tidal effects: period synchronization, orbit circularization, and a minimal pericenter constraint for binaries ($r_p \propto (P_{orb}/P_{rot})^{0.77}$). These findings offer insights into tidal evolution, provide a robust method for identifying stellar multiplicity, and have implications for stellar evolution, binary formation, and exoplanet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional tearing instability of flux-tube-like magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental plasma process, is pivotal in understanding energy conversion and particle acceleration in astrophysical systems. While extensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) configurations, the dynamics of reconnection in three-dimensional (3D) systems remain under-explored. In this work, we extend the classical tearing mode instability to 3D by introducing a modulation along the otherwise uniform direction in a 2D equilibrium, given by $g(y)$, mimicking a flux tube-like configuration. We perform linear stability analysis (both analytically and numerically) and direct numerical simulations to investigate the effects of three-dimensionality. Remarkably, we find that a tearing-like instability arises in 3D as well, even without the presence of guide fields. Further, our findings reveal that the 3D tearing instability exhibits reduced growth rates compared to 2D by a factor of $\int g(y)^{1/2} dy~/\int dy$, with the dispersion relation maintaining similar scaling characteristics. We show that the modulation introduces spatially varying resistive layer properties, which influence the reconnection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Jet-shaped filamentary ejecta in common envelope evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE) of a neutron star (NS) that launches jets as it spirals in inside the envelope of a rotating red supergiant (RSG) stellar envelope and find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities form filamentary ejecta. We first study the 3D RSG envelope properties before we launch the jets. Adding envelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and contract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after two oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model. In addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the non-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we strengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar models of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding jets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that envelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than in the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with and without envelope rotation. The jet-inflated high-pressure volumes around the NS accelerate the envelope, a process prone to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>Insights into the 3D layered structure of nearby open clusters through N-body simulations</title>

Abstract: Context. Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation, dynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between cluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of the layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the three-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the formation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial distribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a layered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd N-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the correlation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius of the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals that OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results from N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is strongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star and the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova explosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore, clusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure, likely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations caused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse and slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive stars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption of the layered structure in OCs.</description>

      <title>Architecture of Tianyu Software: Relative Photometry as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.
