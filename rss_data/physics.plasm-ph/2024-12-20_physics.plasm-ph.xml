      <title>Higher-order dissipative anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the method of moments to the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and derive the equations of motion for the irreducible moments of arbitrary tensor-rank of the invariant single-particle distribution function. We study two cases, in the first of which the moments are taken to be irreducible with respect to the little group associated with the time-like fluid four-velocity, while in the second case they are assumed to be also irreducible with respect to a space-like four-vector orthogonal to the fluid four-velocity, which breaks the spatial isotropy to a rotational symmetry in the plane transverse to this vector. A systematic truncation and closure of the general moment equations leads, in the first case, to a theory of relativistic higher-order dissipative resistive magnetohydrodynamics. In the second case, we obtain a novel theory of dissipative resistive anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics, where the momentum anisotropy is in principle independent from that introduced by the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A coordinate-free expression of plasma theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of plasmas, that is collectives of charged particles, is developed using the coordinate-free and geometric methods of exterior calculus. This dramatically simplifies the algebra and gives a geometric physical interpretation. The fundamental foundation on which the theory is built is the conservation of phase space volume expressed by the Generalized Liouville Equation in terms of the Lie derivative. The theory is expanded both in the order of the correlation and in the weakness of the correlation. This gives a Generalized BBGKY (Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) Hierarchy. The derivation continues to give a new generalized formula for the Variational Theory of Reaction Rates (VTRR). Pullbacks of the generalized formulas to generic canonical coordinates and Poisson brackets are done. Where appropriate, the canonical coordinates are assumed to be "action-angle" coordinates that are generated by the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the action. Finally, generalized forms of all the common kinetic equations are derived: the Vlasov Equation, the Boltzmann Equation, the Master Equation, the Fokker-Planck Equation, the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) Equation, the Fluid Equations, and the MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) Equations. Specific examples are given of these equations. The application of the VTRR to three-body recombination in a strong magnetic field is shown.</description>

      <title>Generation and Acceleration of Isolated-Attosecond Electron Bunch in a Hollow-Channel Plasma Wakefield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for generating and accelerating simultaneously a dozen-GeV isolated attosecond electron bunch from an electron beam-driven hollow-channel plasma target. During the beam-target interaction, transverse oscillations of plasma electrons are induced, and subsequently, a radiative wakefield is generated. Meanwhile, a large number of plasma electrons of close to the speed of light are injected transversely from the position of the weaker radiative wakefield (e.g., the half-periodic node of the radiative wakefield) and converge towards the center of the hollow channel, forming an isolated attosecond electron bunch. Then, the attosecond electron bunch is significantly accelerated to high energies by the radiative wakefield. It is demonstrated theoretically and numerically that this scheme can efficiently generate an isolated attosecond electron bunch with a charge of more than 2 nC, a peak energy up to 13 GeV of more than 2 times that of the driving electron beam, a peak divergence angle of less than 5 mmrad, a duration of 276 as, and an energy conversion efficiency of 36.7% as well as a high stability as compared with the laser-beam drive case. Such an isolated attosecond electron bunch in the range of GeV would provide critical applications in ultrafast physics and high energy physics, etc.</description>

      <title>An upper pressure limit for low-Z benign termination of runaway electron beams in TCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for the particle balance in the post-disruption runaway electron plateau phase of a tokamak discharge. The model is constructed with the help of, and applied to, experimental data from TCV discharges investigating the so-called "low-Z benign termination" runaway electron mitigation scheme. In the benign termination scheme, the free electron density is first reduced in order for a subsequently induced MHD instability to grow rapidly and spread the runaway electrons widely across the wall. The model explains why there is an upper limit for the neutral pressure above which the termination is not benign. We are also able to show that the observed non-monotonic dependence of the free electron density with the measured neutral pressure is due to plasma re-ionization induced by runaway electron impact ionization. At higher neutral pressures, more target particles are present in the plasma for runaway electrons to collide with and ionize. Parameter scans are conducted to clarify the role of the runaway electron density and energy on the upper pressure limit, and it is found that only the runaway electron density has a noticeable impact.</description>

      <title>Single-mode laser guiding in non-parabolic plasma channels for high-energy electron acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of laser wakefield acceleration in gaseous plasma was a major milestone that could lead to a significant reduction of size and cost of large electron accelerators. For higher-energy laser-driven electron acceleration guiding plasma channels were proposed, which are matched to the laser pulse parameters. For guiding a Gaussian beam, a parabolic density profile is needed, which is difficult to realize experimentally. The realistic channel profiles can be described by higher order polynomial functions which are not optimal for guiding due to the development of undesired distortions in the laser intensity envelope. However, here we show that for non-parabolic plasma channels well-defined matching conditions exist, which we call mode matching. This leads to the guiding of the fundamental mode only in the acceleration regime, where the plasma electron density is modulated by the high-intensity laser pulse. In this way, we eliminate two deteriorating factors of laser wakefield acceleration, namely the mode dispersion and energy leakage. We apply this new matching condition for single-mode guiding in quasi-3D simulations to show that 10 GeV energies can be reached in a distance of less than 15 cm.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the parameter space of piecewise omnigenous stellarator magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise omnigenous fields are stellarator magnetic fields that are optimized with respect to radial neoclassical transport thanks to a second adiabatic invariant that is piecewisely constant on the flux-surface. They are qualitatively different from omnigenous fields (including quasi-isodynamic or quasisymmetric fields), for which the second adiabatic invariant is a flux-surface constant. Piecewise omnigenous fields thus open an alternative path towards stellarator reactors. In this work, piecewise omnigenous fields are characterized and parametrized in a systematic manner. This is a step towards including piecewise omnigenity as an explicit design criterion in stellarator optimization, and towards a systematic study of the properties of nearly piecewise omnigenous stellarator configurations.</description>

      <title>ThinCurr: An open-source 3D thin-wall eddy current modeling code for the analysis of large-scale systems of conducting structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new thin-wall eddy current modeling code, ThinCurr, for studying inductively-coupled currents in 3D conducting structures -- with primary application focused on the interaction between currents flowing in coils, plasma, and conducting structures of magnetically-confined plasma devices. The code utilizes a boundary finite element method on an unstructured, triangular grid to accurately capture device structures. The new code, part of the broader Open FUSION Toolkit, is open-source and designed for ease of use without sacrificing capability and speed through a combination of Python, Fortran, and C/C++ components. Scalability to large models is enabled through use of hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank compression of the inductance matrix, which is otherwise dense. Ease of handling large models of complicated geometry is further supported by automatic determination of supplemental elements through a greedy homology approach. A detailed description of the numerical methods of the code and verification of the implementation of those methods using cross-code comparisons against the VALEN code and Ansys commercial analysis software is shown.</description>

      <title>The pellet rocket effect in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pellets of frozen material travelling into a magnetically confined fusion plasma are accelerated by the so-called pellet rocket effect. The non-uniform plasma heats the pellet ablation cloud asymmetrically, producing pressure-driven, rocket-like propulsion of the pellet. We present a semi-analytical model of this process by perturbing a spherically symmetric ablation model. Predicted pellet accelerations match experimental estimates in current tokamaks ($\sim 10^5 \;\rm m/s^2$). Projections for ITER high-confinement scenarios ($\sim 10^6 \;\rm m/s^2$) indicate significantly shorter pellet penetration than expected without this effect, which could limit the effectiveness of disruption mitigation.</description>

      <title>Performance envelope of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser wakefield accelerator experiments have made enormous progress over the past $\sim 20$ years, but their promise to revolutionize high-energy particle sources is only beginning to be realized. To make the next step toward engineering LWFAs for different accelerator outcomes, we need more reliable and quantitative models to predict performance. Using the data from $&gt;50$ published experiments, we estimate scalings and the performance envelope. We compare the observed scalings with several models in the literature. We find that the total beam energy (centroid energy times beam charge) scales almost linearly with laser energy, supporting the value of investment in progressively higher energy driver lasers. The dataset includes pulse durations from 8 to 160 fs, but only laser wavelengths of 800 nm and 1 \si{\micro\meter}, meaning we could not check proposed wavelength scalings for alternative laser technologies. As a benchmark next-generation case, the observed scalings suggest that achieving a 100-GeV LWFA stage will require a $\gtrsim 30$ PW laser operating at electron density $&lt;10^{17}/$cm$^3$.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetries for the Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics Equations in a Rotating Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed Lie symmetry analysis for the hyperbolic system of partial differential equations that describe the one-dimensional Shallow Water magnetohydrodynamics equations within a rotating reference frame. We consider a relaxing condition $\mathbf{\mathbf{\nabla }}\left( h\mathbf{B} \right) \neq 0$ for the one-dimensional problem, which has been used to overcome unphysical behaviors. The hyperbolic system of partial differential equations depends on two parameters: the constant gravitational potential $g$ and the Coriolis term $f_{0}$, related to the constant rotation of the reference frame. For four different cases, namely $g=0,~f_{0}=0$; $g\neq 0\,,~f_{0}=0$; $g=0$, $f_{0}\neq 0$; and $g\neq 0$, $f_{0}\neq 0$ the admitted Lie symmetries for the hyperbolic system form different Lie algebras. Specifically the admitted Lie algebras are the $L^{10}=\left\{ A_{3,3}\rtimes A_{2,1}\right\} \otimes _{s}A_{5,34}^{a}$; $% L^{8}=A_{2,1}\rtimes A_{6,22}$; $L^{7}=A_{3,5}\rtimes\left\{ A_{2,1}\rtimes A_{2,1}\right\} $; and $L^{6}=A_{3,5}\rtimes A_{3,3}~$respectively, where we use the Morozov-Mubarakzyanov-Patera classification scheme. For the general case where $f_{0}g\neq 0$, we derive all the invariants for the Adjoint action of the Lie algebra $L^{6}$ and its subalgebras, and we calculate all the elements of the one-dimensional optimal system. These elements are then considered to define similarity transformations and construct analytic solutions for the hyperbolic system.</description>

      <title>Influence of ICME-driven Magnetic Cloud-like and Sheath Region induced Geomagnetic Storms in causing anomalous responses of the Low-latitude Ionosphere: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic conditions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06$^\circ$N, 72.54$^\circ$E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20$^\circ$), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It is shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it is the non-fluctuating southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind variations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.</description>

      <title>Rydberg states and new resonant states of the imidogen molecule NH: pathways for nitrogen release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral resonant states of molecules play a very important role in the dissociation dynamics and other electronic processes that occur via intermediate capture into these states. With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Transient chirp reconstruction of electron beam via tightly focused chirped laser pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the phase space of particle beams is essential for the generation of high-quality, ultrashort electron beams in plasma-based accelerators. Accurately diagnosing the transient energy chirp, which evolves rapidly at the onset of acceleration, presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel method for reconstructing the transient energy chirp of ultrashort electron beams by employing tightly focused and chirped laser pulses. We investigate the conditions that enhance the modulation of electron-beam divergence and illustrate the reconstruction of transient chirp based on the intrinsic phase correlation of the modulated divergence as projected onto specific phase space coordinates. Additionally, we estimate the temporal delay between the laser and electron beam by applying a Fourier transform to the reconstructed divergence modulation in the frequency domain. This approach holds promise for optimizing accelerator performance and facilitates the probing of timing jitter in ultrafast electron diffraction with attosecond-level precision.</description>

      <title>Ion acceleration from micrometric targets immersed in an intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of proton acceleration by intense laser irradiation of micrometric bar targets, whose dimensions are transversely immersed in the laser focal volume and longitudinally smaller than half its wavelength. Using only 120 mJ of laser energy, we recorded proton energies in excess of 6 MeV, exceeding those reported with any other experimental method by a factor of 3. 3D particle-in-cell simulations revealed that the efficient energy transfer from the diffracted laser fields to electrons on both sides of the target, combined with its reduced surface area, results in a thicker electron sheath and higher accelerating electric field gradients. We demonstrated numerically how this ion acceleration technique opens up the possibility of laser ion acceleration in multiple stages, allowing manipulation of the accelerated ion spectrum by optical means.</description>

      <title>On turbulent magnetic reconnection: fast and slow mean steady-states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of turbulent magnetic reconnection introduced by Higashimori, Yokoi and Hoshino (Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 255001) and show that the classic two-dimensional, steady-state Sweet-Parker and Petschek reconnection solutions are supported. We present evidence that these are the only two steady-state reconnection solutions, and we determine the criterion for their selection. Sweet-Parker reconnection occurs when there is no growth in turbulent energy, whereas Petschek reconnection occurs when the current density in the reconnecting current sheet is able to surpass a critical value, allowing for the growth of turbulent energy that creates the diffusion region. Further, we show that the Petschek solutions are self-similar, depending on the value of the turbulent time scale, and produce a universal steady reconnection rate. The self-consistent development of Petschek reconnection through turbulence, within the model, is an example of fast and steady magnetic reconnection without an explicit need for the collisionless terms in an extended Ohm's law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Madelung transformation on a generalized scalar Gross-Pitaevski equation, a nonlinear continuum fluid equations are derived for a classical fluid. A unitary quantum lattice algorithm is then determined as a second order discrete representation of this Gross-Pitaevski equation and the simulations are compared to those using classical fluid dynamic techniques.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Theory Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability of Parker's Steady Solar Wind Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a novel optimal theoretical framework based on potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics which provides a smooth extrapolation of Parker's steady solar wind model to the unsteady case. The viability of this framework is illustrated by providing the first ever systematic theoretical formulation to successfully address the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point (where the solar wind flow velocity equals the speed of sound in the gas) in the linear stability problem of Parker's steady solar wind solution. This development involves going outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporating the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system, and hence provides an appropriate nonlinear recipe to regularize this singularity. The stability of Parker's steady wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by analyzing the concomitant nonlinear problem. The new theoretical framework given here seems, therefore, to have the potential to provide a viable basis for future formulations addressing various theoretical aspects of Parker's unsteady solar wind model.</description>

      <title>Effect of Turbulent Kinetic Helicity on Diffusive beta effect for Large Scale Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated a plasma system with kinematic viscosity ($\nu = 0.006$) and magnetic diffusivity ($\eta = 0.006$), driven by helical kinetic energy, to study the dynamics of energy and helicity in magnetic diffusion. Using the numerical data obtained, we explored methods to determine the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients that linearize the nonlinear electromotive force (EMF) and the dynamo process. Initially, we applied conventional statistical approaches such as mean-field theory (MFT), direct interaction approximation (DIA), and eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure. We then proposed a simpler alternative method using large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data to calculate $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Our findings show that while $\alpha$ qualitatively aligns with theoretical predictions, $\beta$ remains negative, indicating an inverse cascade of energy through magnetic diffusion. This deviated from conventional models and was further analyzed using a recursive method in the second moment identity, revealing that small-scale kinetic helicity couples with large-scale current density to transport energy inversely. We validated our method by reproducing the numerically calculated data. The consistency between our method and direct numerical simulations (DNS) suggests that the negative diffusion process in plasma has a physical basis.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of light-matter interactions in degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</description>
