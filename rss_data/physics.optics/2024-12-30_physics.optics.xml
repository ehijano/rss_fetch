      <title>Robust phase correction techniques for terahertz time-domain reflection spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic approach that enables two robust methods for performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.</description>

      <title>Phononically shielded multi-wavelength photonic-crystal membrane for cavity quantum optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and design a stoichiometric silicon-nitride membrane resonator featuring highly reflective at multi-wavelengths and high mechanical quality factor. The membrane resonator has a thickness of 100 nm and 2D-photonic and phononic crystal patterns. By designing concentric holes of suitable radius on both sides of the membrane, high reflectivity at multi-wavelengths can be achieved. In particularly, the simulation shows that high reflectivity can be realized at telecommunications wavelength and alkaline atoms absorption lines, with reflectivity of 99.76% at 852 nm, and 99.98% at 1054 nm, and 99.96% at 1566 nm, respectively. The designed device can find useful applications in cavity optomechanical system to realize quantum frequency conversion and precise quantum measurement, and other field of quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Conductance-Photoacoustic Spectroscopy for OneSignal Measurement of Multi-components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and efficiency in emerging hydrogen-hydrocarbon fuel systems requires accurate measurement of multiple gas components in real time. However, existing detection techniques generally lack the capability to quantitatively measure hydrogen and natural gas constituents simultaneously. Here, we present a novel conductance-photoacoustic spectroscopy (CPAS) method that integrates platinum-modified conductance measurements with beat-frequency photoacoustic detection. By bridging a quartz tuning fork with a platinum microwire, our approach enables direct monitoring of hydrogen concentration via frequency modulation, while simultaneously capturing propane's photoacoustic signal with a single detection channel. Experimental results confirm that the platinum microwire effectively fine-tunes the tuning fork's mechanical properties for high-sensitivity hydrogen measurement, and the beat-frequency photoacoustic signals from propane absorption reveal complementary hydrocarbon concentration information. This unified sensor design is inherently compact, rapid, and calibration-free, making it particularly suitable for applications that demand real-time multiparameter gas analysis, including industrial process control and environmental monitoring. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that combining conductance and photoacoustic spectroscopies into a single integrated platform significantly advances the state of multi-component gas detection and holds promise for further enhancements in sensitivity and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic tuning of ENZ wavelength in conductive polymer films via polaron excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional metal and n-type doped semiconductor materials serve as emerging epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, showcasing great potential for nonlinear photonic applications. However, a significant limitation for such materials is the lack of versatile ENZ wavelength tuning, and thus dynamic tuning of the ENZ wavelength remains a technical challenge, thereby restricting their potential applications, such as multi-band communications. Here, dynamic tuning of the ENZ wavelength in p-type organic PEDOT: PSS films is achieved through a reversible change in hole concentrations originated from the polaron formation/decoupling following optical excitation, and a tunable ENZ wavelength shift up to 150 nm is observed. Experimental investigations about ultrafast dynamics of polaron excitation reveal an approximately 80 fs time constant for polaron buildup and an approximately 280 fs time constant for polaron decoupling, indicating the potential of reversal ultrafast switching for the ENZ wavelength within subpicosecond time scale. These findings suggest that $p$--type organic semiconductors can serve as a novel platform for dynamically tuning the ENZ wavelength through polaron excitation, opening new possibilities for ENZ--based nonlinear optical applications in flexible optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Engineering whispering gallery modes in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure nanocavities: Towards developing all-TMDC light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as highly promising materials for nanophotonics and optoelectronics due to their exceptionally high refractive indices, strong excitonic photoluminescence (PL) in monolayer configurations, and the versatility to engineer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</description>

      <title>Wavelength Control of Perovskite Metasurface Lasing via Electrical Microheaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskites have recently brought significant advances to active nanophotonics, offering a unique combination of gain and phase-change properties for tunable light-emitting devices. However, current wavelength-tunable devices often rely on tuning mechanisms or device architectures that lead to slow modulation or bulky setups. In this study, we overcome limitations on speed and size by demonstrating a compact tunable microlaser embedding electrical microheaters beneath a perovskite metasurface. This architecture allows to efficiently deliver heat and rapidly modulate the phase transition. Our device leverages the optical gain and crystallographic phase tuning of the perovskite, and a high-quality factor cavity design based on bound states in the continuum. With it, we demonstrate reversible laser wavelength switching between 763 nm and 783 nm within 13 ms at 2.3 V. This work unlocks the potential of perovskite metasurfaces for electrically tunable light sources and introduces a flexible platform which can be easily extended to the dynamic control of polarization or directionality for optical communication, sensing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Flat panel laser displays enabled by large-scale visible photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-based displays are highly sought after for their superior brightness and color performance, especially in advanced applications like augmented reality (AR). However, their broader adoption has been hindered by bulky projector designs and complex optical module assemblies. Here, we introduce a new laser display architecture enabled by large-scale visible photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to address these challenges. Unlike previous projector-style laser displays, this architecture features an ultra-thin, flat-panel form factor, replacing bulky free-space illumination modules with a single, high-performance photonic chip. Centimeter-scale PIC devices, which integrate thousands of distinct optical components on-chip, are carefully tailored to achieve high display uniformity, contrast, and efficiency. We demonstrate a 2 mm-thick flat-panel laser display combining the PIC with a liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) panel, achieving 211% of the color gamut and more than 80% volume reduction compared to traditional LCoS displays. We further showcase its application in a see-through AR system. Our work represents a major advancement in the integration of nanophotonics with display technology, enabling a range of new display concepts, from high-performance immersive displays to slim-panel 3D holography.</description>

      <title>Integrated Electro-Optic Absorption Modulator for Silicon Nitride Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) is currently the most prominent platform for photonics at visible and near-IR wavelength bandwidth. However, realizing fast electro-optic (EO) modulators, the key components of any integrated optics platform, remains challenging in SiN. Recently, transparent conductive oxides (TCO) have emerged as a promising platform for photonic integrated circuits. Here we make an important step towards exceeding possibilities of both platforms, reporting for the first-time high-speed ITO electro-optic modulators based on silicon nitride waveguides. The insertion losses of 5.7 dB and bandwidth of about 1 GHz are shown for 300 nm-thickness SiN waveguide platform with 9.3-um-length hybrid waveguide. The fabrication process of devices requires only standard clean room tools, is repeatable and compatible with the CMOS technology. Simulation results of optimized device designs indicate that further improvement is possible and offer promising opportunities towards silicon nitride photonic computation platforms based on ITO.</description>

      <title>Optical probing of fractal and multifractal connection to structural disorder in weakly optical disordered media: Application to cancer detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light scattering experiment establishes a relationship between refractive index fluctuations and fractal dimension in weakly scattering tissue-like media. Based on the box-counting approach, an analytical model is developed and shows that the fractal dimension has a functional dependency on the structural disorder or refractive index fluctuation for short-range correlation and approximately linearly depends on each other for tissue-like media. Several parametric imaging systems can be connected using this approach. Further, tissue's weak multifractality optical scattering is explored using the box-counting method. It is shown that with a functional transformation, the distribution follows lognormal distributions.</description>

      <title>Versatile High-Power Monolithic All-Glass Fiber Amplifier for Pulsed Signals with a Wide Range of Repetition Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a compact, high-power monolithic all-glass spun tapered double-clad fiber amplifier for single-stage amplification of narrow linewidth picosecond pulsed signals from a few tens of mW to several hundred Watts of average power and MW level of peak power, covering a wide range of repetition rates. The absence of free-space elements in the amplifier module enhances its overall reliability by omitting the dependency on the pump alignment and internal back reflections. The versatile all-glass amplifier module delivers 50 ps pulses with over 2 MW peak power at 1 MHz, 50 ps pulses with over 625 W average power at 20 MHz, and 20 ps pulses with over 645 W average power at 1 GHz, all exhibiting excellent spectral, spatial, and polarization characteristics. This monolithic all-glass ultra-large mode area fiber amplifier is verified as a robust solution for direct amplification of short pulses attaining high peak/average power laser systems with excellent spectral, spatial, and polarization characteristics.</description>

      <title>Photonic classification on a single diffractive layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computation started to shape the future of fast, efficient and accessible computation. The advantages brought by light based Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (D2NN), are shown to be overwhelmingly advantageous especially in targeting classification problems. However, cost and complexity of multi-layer systems are the main challenges that reduce the deployment of this technology. In this study, we develop a simple yet extremely efficient way to achieve optical classification using a single diffractive optical layer. A spatial light modulator is used not only to emulate the classifying system but also the input medium for the objects to be classified by the system. Using our approach, we classify road traffic signs which has a direct application on daily life and safety. We perform classification of road signs under the effect of noise and show that we can successfully classify road signs with more than 75% accuracy under 20% noise/imperfection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for retrieving the ultrafast valley polarization (VP) dynamics in two-dimensional hexagonal materials via attosecond circular dichroism (CD) transient absorption spectroscopy. This approach builds on the CD transition between the first and higher conduction bands induced by the circularly polarized probe pulses. The population imbalance at nonequivalent valleys in the first conduction band is proportionally mapped onto the difference in absorption coefficients of two probe pulses with opposite helicities, supporting an unprecedented quantitative retrieval of the corresponding VP dynamics with subfemtosecond time resolution. We theoretically demonstrate the scheme for h-BN and MoS2 through ab initio calculations, achieving an accurate retrieval of the VP dynamics, particularly the transient VP switching processes, with a time resolution of 250 as.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of the spatial structural alteration in the human brain tissues and cells and DNA and chromatin due to Parkinsons disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinsons disease (PD) is considered one of the most frequent neurological diseases in the world. There is a need to study the early and efficient biomarkers of Parkinsons, such as changes in structural disorders like DNA and chromatin, especially at the subcellular level in the human brain. We used two techniques, Partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect the changes in structural disorder in the human brain tissue samples. It was observed from the PWS experiment that there was an increase in structural disorder in Parkinsons disease tissues and cells when compared to normal tissues and cells using mesoscopic light transport theory. Furthermore, the IPR experiment also showed DNA and chromatin structural alterations that have the same trend and support the PWS results. The increase in mass density in the nuclei components, such as DNA and chromatin, can be linked to the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of the brain. This protein deposition is considered a significant cause of neuronal death in the brains of PD patients. We also did a histological analysis of brain tissues, which supports our results from dual photonics techniques. The results show that this dual technique is a powerful approach to detect the changes. Our results highlight the potential of the parameter, related to the structural disorder strength, as an efficient biomarker for PD progress, paving the way for research into early disease detection.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits on Fiber-Based Electron Acceleration $-$ and How to Overcome Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accelerate ultra-relativistic charged particles, such as electrons, using an electromagnetic pulse along a hollow-core waveguide, the pulse needs to have a longitudinal electric field component and a phase velocity of $c$, the speed of light in vacuum. We derive an approximate closed-form expression for the wavelength at which the phase velocity of the TM$_{01}$ mode in a metal-clad hollow-core fiber with a dielectric layer is $c$. The expression is then used to derive conditions for material dispersion required of the dielectric in order to simultaneously have $c$ phase and group velocity. It is shown that the dispersion would need to be so heavily anomalous that the losses in the anomalously dispersive regime would render such a particle accelerator useless. We then propose the utilization of gain in the form of two spectral peaks in the dielectric to circumvent the otherwise fundamental limits and allow for TM$_{01}$ pulses with $c$ phase and group velocity and thus arbitrary length-scaling of fiber-based electron accelerators. In theory, the group velocity dispersion could also be made zero with further gain-assisted dispersion engineering, allowing for the co-propagation of dispersionless electromagnetic pulses with relativistic particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform extensive simulations of the two-dimensional cavity-coupled electron gas in a modulating potential as a minimal model for cavity quantum materials. These simulations are enabled by a newly developed quantum-electrodynamical (QED) auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. We present a procedure to greatly reduce finite-size effects in such calculations. Based on our results, we show that a modified version of weak-coupling perturbation theory is remarkably accurate for a large parameter region. We further provide a simple parameterization of the light-matter correlation energy as a functional of the cavity parameters and the electronic density. These results provide a numerical foundation for the development of the QED density functional theory, which was previously reliant on analytical approximations, to allow quantitative modeling of a wide range of systems with light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration and modeling of near-infrared nonlinear third-order triple-photon generation stimulated over one mode</title>

Abstract: Triple Photon Generation (TPG) is a third-order nonlinear optical interaction in which a photon, i.e. the pump, splits into three lower energy photons, i.e. modes 1, 2 and 3. The triplets possess different quantum signatures from those of photon pairs, with a strong interest in quantum information. In the present study, we performed the first experimental demonstration of TPG stimulated over one mode of the triplet, mode 1, the previous work on TPG concerning stimulation over two modes,2 and 3. The nonlinear medium is a KTiOPO4 crystal pumped in the picosecond regime (15 ps, 10 Hz) at a pump wavelength of 532 nm. The stimulation beam is emitted by a tunable optical parametric generator: the phase-matching was found at a stimulation wavelength of 1491 nm, the other two modes of the triplet being both at 1654 nm in orthogonal polarizations. Using superconducting nanowires single photon detectors, the measurement of the polarizations and wavelength signatures of the two generated modes are in full agreement with calculations. It has been possible to generate a total number of photons per pulse on modes 2 and 3 up to 2x10-4, which corresponds to the generation of 10-4 triplets per pulse, or 10-5 triplets per second since the repetition rate is equal to 10 Hz. We interpreted these results in the framework of a model we developed on the basis of the nonlinear momentum operator in the Heisenberg representation under the undepleted pump and stimulation approximation.</description>

      <title>Achieving Robust Single-Photon Blockade with a Single Nanotip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscattering losses, due to intrinsic imperfections or external perturbations that are unavoidable in optical resonators, can severely affect the performance of practical photonic devices. In particular, for quantum single-photon devices, robust quantum correlations against backscattering losses, which are highly desirable for diverse applications, have remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that single-photon blockade against backscattering loss, an important purely quantum effect, can be achieved by introducing a nanotip near a Kerr nonlinear resonator with intrinsic defects. We find that the quantum correlation of single photons can approach that of a lossless cavity even in the presence of strong backscattering losses. Moreover, the behavior of such quantum correlation is distinct from that of the classical mean-photon number with different strengths of the nonlinearity, due to the interplay of the resonator nonlinearity and the tip-induced optical coupling. Our work sheds new light on protecting and engineering fragile quantum devices against imperfections, for applications in robust single-photon sources and backscattering-immune quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Entangled dual-comb spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Optical frequency combs have emerged as a cornerstone for a wide range of areas, including spectroscopy, ranging, optical clocks, time and frequency transfer, waveform synthesis, and communications. However, quantum mechanical fluctuations of the optical carrier impose fundamental performance limits on the precision of traditional classical laser frequency combs, particularly in their use for interferometry and spectroscopy. Entanglement, as a quintessential quantum resource, allows for surpassing the fundamental limits of classical systems. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate entangled dual-comb spectroscopy (EDCS) that surmounts the fundamental limits of classical DCS. EDCS builds on tailored entangled spectral structures of the frequency combs, enabling simultaneous detection of all comb lines below the standard quantum limit of classical DCS. Applying EDCS in gas detection, we achieve a 2.6 dB enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio and a 1.7-fold reduction in integration time over classical DCS, rendering EDCS particularly suited for dynamic chemical and biological sensing, where fast, precise measurements subject to power constraints are required. EDCS represents a new paradigm for quantum frequency combs, underscoring their prospects in a plethora of applications in precision metrology, spectroscopy, and timekeeping.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Expressions for Nonlinearity Coefficients in Multimode Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel approximate closed-form expressions for the nonlinear coupling coefficients appearing in the Manakov equations for multimode fibers for space-division multiplexing in the two regimes of strong and weak coupling. The expressions depend only on few fiber design parameters. In particular, the Manakov coefficients are shown to be simple rational numbers which depend solely on the number of guided modes. The overall nonlinearity coefficients are found to decrease with increasing core radius and to stay nearly constant with increasing refractive index difference between core and cladding. Validation is performed through a numerical approach. The consequences of the findings onto fiber design are discussed in terms of achievable data rates. The analysis is mainly focused on the trenchless parabolic graded-index profile, but considerations on the use of realistic trenches and non-parabolic indices, and on the step-index profile are given.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation in zinc oxide subjected to intense mid-infrared femtosecond laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate photo-excitation of electron-hole pairs and high harmonic generation in the bulk of zinc oxide (ZnO) subjected to intense femto-second laser pulses with mid-infrared wavelength. We show that the non-adiabatic response of electrons occurs on a sub-femtosecond time scale interval localized near the peaks of the driving laser electric field. It allows us to obtain an effective Hamiltonian which describes weak interaction of electrons with atto-second pulse train with the second harmonic of the drive laser frequency being the repetition frequency in the train. Electron-hole pairs with energies above-threshold are born in coherent super-position of states by resonant absorption of UV photons and subsequently produce rapidly oscillating electric dipole moment. The dipole radiation emitted during each half-cycle of the laser pulse is characterized by broad continuous spectrum with well-defined cutoff. High-order harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency emerge on top of the continuous background via interference in time of emissions from all half-cycles within the pulse duration. We also discuss the relevance of the pulse envelope for producing clean frequency combs as observed in experiments. Good semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found: clean and well defined odd-order harmonic peaks extending beyond the band edge of ZnO are exhibited for laser linearly polarized at right angles to the optical axis of the crystal.</description>

      <title>High-purity valley-polarized currents induced by bichromatic optical fields in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Producing currents predominantly from a single valley, namely valley-polarized currents, at optical-cycle timescales is an important aspect of the petahertz valleytronics, yet it remains less developed. This work exhibits the feasibility of achieving this goal using bichromatic optical fields, which allow for the precise control of sub-cycle electron dynamics. The combined effect of the helical and asymmetric waveforms of the optical fields leads to highly asymmetric excitation at different valleys and displacement of the excited electrons concurrently, thereby inducing valley-polarized currents with high valley purity, on the sub-optical-cycle timescale. Inherently, the purity of the currents built up from the optical approach remains high even for materials with short decoherence time. Moreover, the direction of the currents can be precisely controlled by adjusting the relative phase of the bichromatic components. Our work offers a promising avenue for generating and modulating high-purity valley-polarized currents at the femtosecond timescale, facilitating the development of petahertz valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Majorana constellations for optical scalar beams and vector fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore Majorana stellar representation on the Riemann sphere for optical scalar beams and vector fields, leveraging the spin and orbital angular momentum of light. For scalar beams, the star constellations for the Laguerre-Gaussian beam basis reside at the poles of the sphere. For vector fields, these constellations represent well-defined circular polarization. The underlying $su(2)$ symmetry of angular momenta enables populating the sphere through generalized unitary rotations of the basis elements, resulting in optical analogues of Bloch and generalized $su(2)$ coherent states for both scalar beams and vector fields. Constellations for scalar Hermite-Gaussian beams and vector Hermite-Gaussian partial Poincar\'e fields, restricted to linear polarization, occupy the equator of the sphere as a result of these rotations. Additionally, we investigate scalar and vector analogues of cat codes and kings of quantumness, providing insights into the visualization and characterization of complex optical beams and fields with potential applications in optical communications.</description>

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution visualization of atomic structures as well as various functional imaging modes utilizing phase contrast. In this study we introduce a semicircular aperture in STEM bright field imaging, which gives a phase contrast transfer function that becomes complex and includes both lower and higher spatial frequency contrast transfer. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional phase plate methods, having no charge accumulation, degradation, or unwanted background noise, which are all problematic in the phase plate material. Also compared to the differential phase contrast or ptychography equipment, this semicircular aperture is far less costly. We apply this approach to visualization of polymer, biological and magnetic samples.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Gas-Phase Transfer and Direct Stamping of Nanomaterials: Comparison of Nanosecond and Femtosecond Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional nanomaterial, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was cleanly transferred via a blister-based laser-induced forward-transfer method. The transfer was performed utilizing femtosecond and nanosecond laser pulses for separation distances of ~16 and ~200 micrometers between a titanium donor film deposited on a glass substrate and a silicon/silicon dioxide receiver. Transfer efficiency was examined for isolated laser pulses as well as for series of overlapping pulses and single layer transfer was confirmed. It was found that hBN is transferable for all tested combinations of pulse duration and transfer distances. The results indicate that transfer proceeds via direct stamping for short donor-to-receiver distances while, for the larger distance, the material is ejected from the donor and lands on the receiver. Furthermore, with overlapping pulses, nanosecond laser pulses enable a successful printing of hBN lines while, for fs laser pulses, the Ti film can be locally disrupted by multiple pulses and molten titanium may be transferred along with the hBN flakes. For reproducibility, and to avoid contamination with metal deposits, low laser fluence transfer with ns pulses and transfer distances smaller than the blister height provide the most favourable and reproducible condition.</description>

Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How pigment distribution influences the cuticle density within a microscopic butterfly wing scale, and how both impact final reflected color remains unknown. We used ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to quantitatively determine, at nanoscale resolutions, the three-dimensional mass density of scales with pigmentation differences. By comparing cuticle densities between pairs of scales with pigmentation differences, we determine that the density of the lower lamina is inversely correlated with pigmentation. In the upper lamina structure, low pigment levels also correlate with sheet-like chitin structures as opposed to rod-like structures. Within each scale, we determine that the lower lamina in all scales has the highest density and distinct layers within the lower lamina help explain reflected color. We hypothesize that pigments, in addition to absorbing specific wavelengths, can affect cuticle polymerization, density, and refractive index, thereby impacting reflected wavelengths that produce colors.</description>

Abstract: Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the state dimension minus one, and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the state dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement with single-particle states is advantageous in quantum technology because of their ability to encode and process information more securely than their multi-particle analogs. Threeway and nonlocal two-way entangled single-particle states are desirable in this context. Herein, we generate genuine three-way entanglement from an initially separable state involving three degrees of freedom of a quantum particle, which evolves via a 2D alternate quantum walk employing a resource-saving single-qubit coin. We achieve maximum possible values for the three-way entanglement quantified by the {\pi}-tangle between the three degrees of freedom. We also generate optimal nonlocal two-way entanglement, quantified by the negativity between the nonlocal position degrees of freedom of the particle. This prepared architecture using quantum walks can be experimentally realized with a photon.</description>

      <title>On the Development of an RFSoC-Based Ultra-Fast Phasemeter With GHz Bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of the frequency and phase of an electrical or optical signal play a key role in various branches of science and engineering. Tracking changing laser frequencies is especially demanding when the lasers themselves are noisy or if the frequencies rapidly change because they encode highly dynamic signals in, e.g., Doppler-ranging or dynamic cavity readout. Here, to address these and other possible applications, we report the development of a high signal bandwidth (&gt; 2 GHz) and high tracking bandwidth (2 MHz) multi-channel Phasemeter. The implementation utilizes an all-digital phase-locked loop realized within the field programmable gate array (FPGA) part of a radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC), the programmable logic (PL). The new features of the phasemeter are obtained by operating the PL at its timing limits and introducing a multi-demodulation and phase accumulation scheme. We present performance measurements, discuss the role of the high tracking bandwidth for tracking highly dynamic signals, and demonstrate ultra-stable phase locking of a beat note between two widely tunable external cavity diode lasers. We achieve a phase-noise floor in the sub-milli radian regime when comparing two signals, even for GHz frequencies, and demonstrate stable tracking of signals with a frequency change rate of 240 GHz/s.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation with topological edge states and electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been found previously that the presence or absence of topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has a huge impact on harmonic generation spectra. More specifically, the yield of harmonics for harmonic orders that correspond to photon energies below the band gap is many orders of magnitude different in the trivial and topological phase. It is shown in this work that this effect is still present if electron-electron interaction is taken into account, i.e., if a Hubbard term is added to the SSH Hamiltonian. To that end, finite SSH-Hubbard chains at half filling are considered that are short enough to be accessible to exact diagonalization but already showing edge states in the topological phase. We show that the huge difference in the harmonic yield between the trivial and the topological phase can be reproduced with few-level models employing only the many-body ground state and a few excited many-body states.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Framework for Engineering Arbitrary Floquet Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-system entanglement occurs between non-separable modes within the same system. For optical systems, the various degrees of freedom of light represent different modes, and the potential use of light to create higher dimensional classical entangle states offers a promising potential to drive new technological developments. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating the orthogonality between transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of different spatiotemporal topological charges, a previously unverified property of t-OAM. Based on those results, we developed methods to create and characterize a novel family of t-OAM and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light. We further provide theoretical analysis to support our study of the entanglement between those modes. By demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging t-OAM as a new family of modes for classical entanglement, our work represents a new advancement towards higher dimensional classical entanglement strategies.</description>
