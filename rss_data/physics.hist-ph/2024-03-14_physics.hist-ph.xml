      <title>GR as a classical spin-2 theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-interaction spin-2 approach to general relativity (GR) has been extremely influential in the particle physics community. Leaving no doubt regarding its heuristic value, we argue that a view of the metric field of GR as nothing but a stand-in for a self-coupling field in flat spacetime runs into a dilemma: either the view is physically incomplete in so far as it requires recourse to GR after all, or it leads to an absurd multiplication of alternative viewpoints on GR rendering any understanding of the metric field as nothing but a spin-2 field in flat spacetime unjustified.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Divide(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the possible divides resulting from the introduction of emerging quantum technologies (QT) to society. It provides the multidirectional impacts of QT on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We aim to challenge the idea of a singular "quantum divide" by presenting a more comprehensive perspective. To complement the existing literature on the quantum divide, we propose four distinct divides that could result from the emergence of QT. Firstly, we examine the "Quantum Divide in Science", representing the paradigmatic gap among scientists and inequalities in access to knowledge/resources within research communities. We suggest the "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency" as the second possible divide, examining the adoption processes of certain technologies to be developed by nations, firms, and research communities. The discussion extends internationally, focusing on the "Quantum Divide between Countries," by dealing with the reasons and outcomes of the adoption processes between countries of different development levels (economically, industrially, and technologically). As the final divide, we put forth our perspective on the "Quantum Divide within Societies", one of the most explored ones in the literature, addressing societal implications. For each type of the divide, we propose several directions to navigate them, some complementary, some incompatible. Finally, we discuss the interconnectedness and distinctness of different types of divides and how they impact the directions to navigate them. This study serves as a guidance for those interested in a more in-depth investigation of the concept of quantum divide, possible directions of navigating the divides, and how the introduction of QT might affect the innovation ecosystems by impacting the scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</description>

      <title>Bell Correlations as Selection Artefacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Bell correlations may arise as a special sort of selection artefact, produced by ordinary control of the initial state of the experiments concerned. This accounts for nonlocality, without recourse to any direct spacelike causality or influence. The argument improves an earlier proposal in (arXiv:2101.05370v4 [quant-ph], arXiv:2212.06986 [quant-ph]) in two main respects: (i) in demonstrating its application in a real Bell experiment; and (ii) in avoiding the need for a postulate of retrocausality. This version includes an Appendix, discussing the relation of the proposal to the conclusions of Wood and Spekkens (arXiv:1208.4119 [quant-ph]).</description>
