      <title>Apparatus for Optical-Atomic System Integration &amp; Calibration: 1 atm to 1$\times$10$^{-11}$ Torr in 24h</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms exquisitely controlled by lasers are the quantum foundation, particularly for sensing, timekeeping, and computing, of state-of-the-art quantum science and technology. However, the laboratory-scale infrastructure for such optical-atomic quantum apparatuses rarely translates into commercial applications. A promising solution is miniaturizing the optical layouts onto a chip-scale device integrated with cold atoms inside a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber. For prototyping purposes, however, rapidly loading or exchanging test photonic devices into a UHV chamber is limited by the evacuation time from atmospheric pressures to the optimal pressures for ultracold atoms of $1\times10^{-11}$ Torr, a process typically taking weeks or months without cryogenics. Here, we present a loadlock apparatus and loading procedure capable of venting, exchanging, and evacuating back to $&lt;1\times10^{-11}$ Torr in under 24 hours. Our system allows for rapid testing and benchmarking of various photonic devices with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>A BCS state formulation for the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative expression for the ground state wave function of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. Our wave function is constructed based on the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix. We demonstrate that the newly found wave function describes the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas under any external potential. By expressing the proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit expressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the suitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. With this, we prove and show how to detect that the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits non-trivial quantum correlations but is also a paired state.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Sound in a Tunable Fermi Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL) theory has been successful at the phenomenological description of the normal phase of many different Fermi systems. Using a dilute atomic Fermi fluid with tunable interactions, we investigate the microscopic basis of Landau's theory with a system describable from first principles. We study transport properties of an interacting Fermi gas by measuring its density response to a periodic external perturbation. In an ideal Fermi gas, we measure for the first time the celebrated Lindhard function. As the system is brought from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, we observe the emergence of sound, and find that the experimental observations are quantitatively understood with a first-principle transport equation for the FL. When the system is more strongly interacting, we find deviations from such predictions. Finally, we observe the shape of the quasiparticle excitations directly from momentum-space tomography and see how it evolves from the collisionless to the collisional regime. Our study establishes this system as a clean platform for studying Landau's theory of the FL and paves the way for extending the theory to more exotic conditions, such as nonlinear dynamics and FLs with strong correlations in versatile settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Apparent delay of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quenched open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new intermediate regime in the quench time, $\tau_{q}$, separating the usual validity of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and its breakdown for rapid quenches in open systems under finite quench protocols. It manifests in the power-law scaling of the transition time with $\tau_{q}$ as the system appears to enter the adiabatic regime, even though the ramp is already terminated and the final quench value is held constant. This intermediate regime, which we dub as the delayed KZM, emerges due to the dissipation preventing the system from freezing in the impulse regime. This results in a large delay between the actual time the system undergoes a phase transition and the time inferred from a threshold-based criterion for the order parameter, as done in most experiments. We demonstrate using the open Dicke model and its one-dimensional lattice version that this phenomenon is a generic feature of open systems that can be mapped onto an effective coupled oscillator model. We also show that the phenomenon becomes more prominent near criticality, and its effects on the transition time measurement can be further exacerbated by large threshold values for an order parameter. Due to this, we propose an alternative method for threshold-based criterion which uses the spatio-temporal information, such as the system's defect number, for identifying the transition time.</description>

      <title>The third virial coefficient of a two-component unitary Fermi gas across an Efimov-effect threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:1412.1974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mixture of two single-spin-state fermions with an interaction of negligible range and infinite $s$-wave scattering length. By varying the mass ratio $\alpha$ across $\alpha_c\simeq 13.6069$ one can switch on-and-off the Efimov effect. We determine analytically the third cluster coefficient of the gas. We show that it is a smooth function of $\alpha$  across $\alpha_c$ since, unexpectedly, the three-body parameter characterizing the interaction is relevant even on the non-Efimovian side $\alpha&lt;\alpha_c$.</description>

      <title>Frustrated extended Bose-Hubbard model and deconfined quantum critical points with optical lattices at the anti-magic wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of geometrically frustrated many-body quantum systems is of central importance to uncover novel quantum mechanical effects. We design a scheme where ultracold bosons trapped in a one-dimensional state-dependent optical lattice are modeled by a frustrated Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. A derivation of the Hamiltonian parameters based on Cesium atoms, further show large tunability of contact and nearest-neighbour interactions. For pure contact repulsion, we discover the presence of two phases peculiar to frustrated quantum magnets: the bond-order-wave insulator with broken inversion symmetry and a chiral superfluid. When the nearest-neighbour repulsion becomes sizeable, a further density-wave insulator with broken translational symmetry can appear. We show that the phase transition between the two spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases is continuous, thus representing a one-dimensional deconfined quantum critical point not captured by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. Our results provide a solid ground to unveil the novel quantum physics induced by the interplay of non-local interactions, geometrical frustration, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Conformal maps and superfluid vortex dynamics on curved and bounded surfaces: the case of an elliptical boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold-atom platforms have made real-time dynamics accessible, renewing interest in the motion of superfluid vortices in two-dimensional domains. Here we show that the energy and the trajectories of arbitrary vortex configurations may be computed on a complicated (curved or bounded) surface, provided that one knows a conformal map that links the latter to a simpler domain (like the full plane, or a circular boundary). We also prove that Hamilton's equations based on the vortex energy agree with the complex dynamical equations for the vortex dynamics, demonstrating that the vortex trajectories are constant-energy curves. We use these ideas to study the dynamics of vortices in a two-dimensional incompressible superfluid with an elliptical boundary, and we derive an analytical expression for the complex potential describing the hydrodynamic flow throughout the fluid. For a vortex inside an elliptical boundary, the orbits are nearly self-similar ellipses.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Solitons Across an Impurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Thouless pumping is an exciting frontier of topological physics. While recent works have revealed the quantized motion of solitons in Thouless pumps, the interplay between the topology, nonlinearity and disorder remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping of solitons in the presence of an impurity in the context of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Using both the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and Lagrangian variational approach, we analyze the interaction between a moving soliton and an impurity. Without the pump, the soliton can pass through a light impurity, but gets trapped by the impurity with large mass. In marked contrast, we find the soliton in Thouless pumps can always transit through the impurity, and its motion is topologically quantized. Our result explicitly showcases the robustness of topological soliton pumping against microscopic imperfections, and opens a new perspective in the information processing with solitons.</description>

      <title>Universality of Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three-body systems in a mass-imbalanced two-component cold-atom mixture, and investigate the three-body parameter of their Efimov states for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with a major focus on the Er-Er-Li Efimov states. For a system interacting solely via van der Waals interactions, the van der Waals universality of the three-body parameter is analytically derived using the quantum defect theory. With the addition of a perturbative dipole interaction between the heavy atoms, the three-body parameters of the bosonic and fermionic Efimov states are found to behave differently. When the dipole interaction is as strong as the van der Waals interaction, corresponding to realistic Er-Er-Li Efimov states, we show that the van der Waals universality persists once the effects of the non-perturbative dipole interaction are renormalized into the s-wave and p-wave scattering parameters between the heavy atoms. For a dipole interaction much stronger than the van der Waals interaction, we find that the universality of the Efimov states can be alternatively characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional scattering parameter due to a strong anisotropic deformation of the Efimov wavefunctions. Our work thus clarifies the interplay of isotropic and anisotropic forces in the universality of the Efimov states. Based on the renormalized van der Waals universality, the three-body parameter is estimated for specific isotopes of Er-Li cold-atom mixtures.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <title>Postselection-free learning of measurement-induced quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address how one can empirically infer properties of quantum states generated by dynamics involving measurements. Our focus is on many-body settings where the number of measurements is extensive, making brute-force approaches based on postselection intractable due to their exponential sample complexity. We introduce a general-purpose scheme that can be used to infer any property of the post-measurement ensemble of states (e.g. the average entanglement entropy, or frame potential) using a scalable number of experimental repetitions. We first identify a general class of estimable properties that can be directly extracted from experimental data. Then, based on empirical observations of such quantities, we show how one can indirectly infer information about any particular given non-estimable quantity of interest through classical post-processing. Our approach is based on an optimization task, where one asks what are the minimum and maximum values that the desired quantity could possibly take, while ensuring consistency with observations. The true value of this quantity must then lie within a feasible range between these extrema, resulting in two-sided bounds. Narrow feasible ranges can be obtained by using a classical simulation of the device to determine which estimable properties one should measure. Even in cases where this simulation is inaccurate, unambiguous information about the true value of a given quantity realised on the quantum device can be learned. As an immediate application, we show that our method can be used to verify the emergence of quantum state designs in experiments. We identify some fundamental obstructions that in some cases prevent sharp knowledge of a given quantity from being inferred, and discuss what can be learned in cases where classical simulation is too computationally demanding to be feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics formalism introduced new revolutionary concepts challenging our everyday perceptions. Arguably, quantum entanglement, which explains correlations that cannot be reproduced classically, is the most notable of them. Besides its fundamental aspect, entanglement is also a resource, fueling emergent technologies such as quantum simulators and computers. The purpose of this chapter is to give a pedagogical introduction to the topic with a special emphasis on the multipartite scenario, i.e., entanglement distributed among many degrees of freedom. Due to the combinatorial complexity of this setting, particles can interact and become entangled in a plethora of ways, which we characterize here. We start by providing the necessary mathematical tools and elementary concepts from entanglement theory. A part of this chapter will be devoted to classifying and ordering entangled states. Then, we focus on various entanglement structures useful in condensed-matter theory such as tensor-network states or symmetric states useful for quantum-enhanced sensing. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art methods to detect and certify such correlations in experiments, with some relevant illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Exact evaluation of large-charge correlation functions in non-relativistic conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-charge master field which generates all n-point correlation functions with an insertion of large charge Q in non-relativistic conformal field theory is obtained. This field is used to compute Schr\"odinger-invariant n-point correlation functions of large-charge operators via a direct evaluation of the path integral. Conformal dimensions are found to agree with calculations based on the state-operator correspondence. The master field solution exhibits an emergent harmonic trap whose frequency is a function of the Euclidean time. The large-charge effective action with operator insertions describes a droplet of superfluid matter whose spatial size scales with the time separation of sources. The solution is used to compute Schr\"odinger symmetry breaking corrections in the large-charge effective field theory (EFT) due to a finite scattering length in the fundamental theory of fermions near unitarity. The scaling of these effects in the large-charge power counting scheme is established, and the size of the effects is quantified using input from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the near-unitary gas, as well as from the large-N expansion at large charge.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem asserts that microscopic details of the system can impose non-trivial constraints on the system's low-energy properties. While traditionally applied to short-range interaction systems, where locality ensures a vanishing spectral gap in large system size limit, the impact of long-range interactions on the LSM theorem remains an open question. Long-range interactions are prevalent in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atoms, dipolar quantum gases, polar molecules, optical cavities, and trapped ions, where the interaction decay exponent can be experimentally tuned. We extend the LSM theorem in one dimension to long-range interacting systems and find that the LSM theorem holds for exponentially or power-law two-body interactions with a decay exponent $\alpha &gt; 2$. However, for power-law interactions with $\alpha &lt; 2$, the constraints of the LSM theorem on the ground state do not apply. Numerical simulations of long-range versions of the Heisenberg and Majumdar-Ghosh models, both satisfying the LSM symmetry requirements, are also provided. Our results suggest promising directions for experimental validation of the LSM theorem in systems with tunable long-range interactions.</description>
