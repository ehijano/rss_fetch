      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit (M4OPT), on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>vis-r: Quick radial profile modelling for radio interferometric visibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a method for parametric radial profile modelling of radio interferometric visibility data. Image-based parametric modelling is common in the field of circumstellar debris disks, and high resolution ALMA observations make this method computationally expensive because many high resolution images must be generated and Fourier transformed. Most circumstellar disks are axisymmetric, so here a method that avoids generating images and instead models radial profiles is outlined. The two main elements are i) $u,v$ space visibility averaging, and ii) using the Discrete Hankel Transform to convert arbitrary parametric radial surface brightness profiles to visibilities. Vertical scale height can be included, but is fixed with radius; in principle this is a limitation but in practise radially-dependent vertical structure information is beyond even ALMA's capability for all but a few debris disks. Combined, these ingredients yield a method that is one to two orders of magnitude faster than image based methods and can be run on a laptop, is sufficient for most ALMA observations of debris disks, and can be used with gradient-based fitting methods such as Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo. A small software package is provided, which is dubbed vis-r.</description>

      <title>That pesky A-term: Efficiently correcting for direction-, time-, and baseline-dependent effects in radio interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio interferometers must grapple with apparent fields of view that distort the true radio sky. These so-called 'A-term' distortions may be direction-, time- and baseline-dependent, and include effects like the primary beam and the ionosphere. Traditionally, properly handling these effects has been computationally expensive and, instead, less accurate, ad-hoc methods have been employed. Image domain gridding (IDG; van der Tol et al., 2018) is a recently developed algorithm that promises to account for these A-terms both accurately and efficiently. Here we describe a new implementation of IDG known as the Parallel Interferometric GPU Imager (Pigi). Pigi is capable of imaging at rates of almost half a billion visibilities per second on modest hardware, making it well suited for the projected data rates of the Square Kilometre Array, and is compatible with both NVIDIA and AMD GPU hardware. Its accuracy is principally limited only by the degree to which A-terms are spatially sampled. Using simulated data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we demonstrate the extraordinary effectiveness of Pigi in correcting for extreme ionospheric effects, and point to future work that would enable these results on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Photonic Lightsails: Fast and Stable Propulsion for Interstellar Travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightsails are a highly promising spacecraft concept that has attracted interest in recent years due to its potential to travel at near-relativistic speeds. Such speeds, which current conventional crafts cannot reach, offer tantalizing opportunities to probe nearby stellar systems within a human lifetime. Recent advancements in photonics and metamaterials have created novel solutions to challenges in propulsion and stability facing lightsail missions. This review introduces the physical principles underpinning lightsail spacecrafts and discusses how photonics coupled with inverse design substantially enhance lightsail performance compared to plain reflectors. These developments pave the way through a previously inaccessible frontier of space exploration.</description>

      <title>HERMES Pathfinder &amp; SpIRIT: a progress report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HERMES Pathfinder is an in-orbit demonstration consisting of a constellation of six 3U cubesats hosting simple but innovative X-ray/gamma-ray detectors for the monitoring of cosmic high-energy transients. HERMES-PF, funded by ASI and by the EC Horizon 2020 grant, is scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. An identical X-ray/gamma-ray detector is hosted by the Australian 6U cubesat SpIRIT, launched on December 1st 2023. The main objective of HERMES-PF/SpIRIT is to demonstrate that high energy cosmic transients can be detected efficiently by miniatured hardware and localized using triangulation techniques. The HERMES-PF X-ray/gamma-ray detector is made by 60 GAGG:Ce scintillator crystals and 12 2x5 silicon drift detector (SDD) mosaics, used to detect both the cosmic X-rays directly and the optical photons produced by gamma-ray interactions with the scintillator crystals. This design provides a unique broad band spectral coverage from a few keV to a few MeV. Furthermore, the use of fast GAGG:Ce crystals and small SDD cells allows us to reach an exquisite time resolution better than a microsecond. We present a progress report on the missions focusing the discussion on the scientific innovation of the project and on the main lessons learned during the project development including: the importance and the challenges of using distributed architectures to achieve ambitious scientific objectives; the importance of developing critical technologies under science agreements for the realization of high-performing but low-cost payloads; best use of COTS technologies in scientific missions. We finally discuss the prospects of applying these concepts for the creation of an all-sky, all-time monitor to search for the high-energy counterparts of gravitational wave events that Advanced LIGO/Virgo/Kagra will find at the end of this decade and the Einstein Telescope during the 2030s.</description>

      <title>A 3D Printed Quad-Ridged Flared Horn Antenna Feeder for Radio-Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a 3D-printed, quad-ridged, dual-pol, flared horn antenna feeder to meet the demands of a modern radio-telescope. The research work presented in this paper involves both the theoretical and the customized / adapted mechanical design of the proposed horn antenna, as well as a description of the 3D-printing and coating process. A novel slotted waveguide approach is followed for perfectly homogeneous coating. Additional mechanical adaptions (i.e. optimized feed section, radome) are employed to provide realistic simulation results. The proposed antenna offers a dual polarization capability and an attractive radiation beam to properly illuminate a 6m mesh dish reflector. A satisfying impedance matching from 1-3 GHz is achieved in both polarizations while maintaining an excellent isolation between the two N-type ports. Reflection coefficient and radiation pattern simulation results are presented, derived from the theoretical and the adapted mechanical design, exhibiting a close agreement.</description>

      <title>A Deep Neural Network Approach to Compact Source Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing extended emission in photometric observations of star-forming regions requires maps free from compact foreground, embedded, and background sources, which can interfere with various techniques used to characterise the interstellar medium. Within the framework of the NEMESIS project, we apply machine learning techniques to improve our understanding of the star formation timescales, which involves the unbiased analysis of the extended emission in these regions. We present a deep learning-based method for separating the signals of compact sources and extended emission in photometric observations made by the Herschel Space Observatory, facilitating the analysis of extended emission and improving the photometry of compact sources. Central to our approach is a modified U-Net architecture with partial convolutional layers. This method enables effective source removal and background estimation across various flux densities, using a series of partial convolutional layers, batch normalisation, and ReLU activation layers within blocks. Our training process utilised simulated sources injected into Herschel images, with controlled flux densities against known backgrounds. A dynamic, signal-to-noise ratio-based adaptive masking system was implemented to assess how prominently a compact source stands out from the surrounding background. The results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the photometric accuracy in the presence of highly fluctuating backgrounds. Moreover, the approach can preserve all characteristics of the images, including the noise properties. The presented approach allows users to analyse extended emission without the interference of disturbing point sources or perform more precise photometry of sources located in complex environments. We also provide a Python tool with tutorials and examples to help the community effectively utilise this method.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Machine Learning to Predict Host Stars and the Key Elemental Abundances of Small Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and their associated planets originate from the same cloud of gas and dust, making a star's elemental composition a valuable indicator for indirectly studying planetary compositions. While the connection between a star's iron (Fe) abundance and the presence of giant exoplanets is established (e.g. Gonzalez 1997; Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005), the relationship with small planets remains unclear. The elements Mg, Si, and Fe are important in forming small planets. Employing machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, trained on the abundances (e.g., the Hypatia Catalog, Hinkel et al. 2014) of known exoplanet-hosting stars (NASA Exoplanet Archive), allows us to determine significant "features" (abundances or molar ratios) that may indicate the presence of small planets. We test on three groups of exoplanets: (a) all small, R$_{P}$ $&lt;$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, (b) sub-Neptunes, 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $&lt;$ R$_{P}$ $&lt;$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, and (c) super-Earths, 1.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $&lt;$ R$_{P}$ $&lt;$ 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ -- each subdivided into 7 ensembles to test different combinations of features. We created a list of stars with $\geq90\%$ probability of hosting small planets across all ensembles and experiments ("overlap stars"). We found abundance trends for stars hosting small planets, possibly indicating star-planet chemical interplay during formation. We also found that Na and V are key features regardless of planetary radii. We expect our results to underscore the importance of elements in exoplanet formation and machine learning's role in target selection for future NASA missions: e.g., the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- all of which are aimed at small planet detection.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project I: A new weak lensing shape catalog of 107 million galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. This catalog was assembled from public DECam data including survey and standard observing programs. These data were consistently processed with the Dark Energy Survey Data Management pipeline as part of the DECADE campaign and serve as the basis of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We apply the Metacalibration measurement algorithm to generate and calibrate galaxy shapes. After cuts, the resulting cosmology-ready galaxy shape catalog covers a region of $5,\!412 \,\,{\rm deg}^2$ with an effective number density of $4.59\,\, {\rm arcmin}^{-2}$. The coadd images used to derive this data have a median limiting magnitude of $r = 23.6$, $i = 23.2$, and $z = 22.6$, estimated at ${\rm S/N} = 10$ in a 2 arcsecond aperture. We present a suite of detailed studies to characterize the catalog, measure any residual systematic biases, and verify that the catalog is suitable for cosmology analyses. In parallel, we build an image simulation pipeline to characterize the remaining multiplicative shear bias in this catalog, which we measure to be $m = (-2.454 \pm 0.124) \times10^{-2}$ for the full sample. Despite the significantly inhomogeneous nature of the data set, due to it being an amalgamation of various observing programs, we find the resulting catalog has sufficient quality to yield competitive cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project II: photometric redshift calibration of the source galaxy sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the photometric redshift characterization and calibration for the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. The redshifts are estimated from a combination of wide-field photometry, deep-field photometry with associated redshift estimates, and a transfer function between the wide field and deep field that is estimated using a source injection catalog. We construct four tomographic bins for the galaxy catalog, and estimate the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, within each one using the Self-organizing Map Photo-Z (SOMPZ) methodology. Our estimates include the contributions from sample variance, zeropoint calibration uncertainties, and redshift biases, as quantified for the deep-field dataset. The total uncertainties on the mean redshifts are $\sigma_{\langle z \rangle} \approx 0.01$. The SOMPZ estimates are then compared to those from the clustering redshift method, obtained by cross-correlating our source galaxies with galaxies in spectroscopic surveys, and are shown to be consistent with each other.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analyses of Solar Active Region in SDO/HMI Magnetograms detected by Unsupervised Machine Learning Method DSARD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) are the places hosting the majority of solar eruptions. Studying the evolution and morphological features of ARs is not only of great significance to the understanding of the physical mechanisms of solar eruptions, but also beneficial for the hazardous space weather forecast. An automated DBSCAN-based Solar Active Regions Detection (DSARD) method for solar ARs observed in magnetograms is developed in this work, which is based on an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). The method is then employed to identify ARs on the magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during solar cycle 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25. The distributions of the number, area, magnetic flux, and the tilt angle of bipolar of ARs in latitudes and time intervals during solar cycle 24, as well as the butterfly diagram and drift velocities are obtained. Most of these statistical results based on our method are in agreement with previous studies, which also guarantees the validity of the method. In particular, the dipole tilt angles in ARs in solar cycle 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 are analyzed which reveal that 13% and 16% of ARs, respectively, violate Hale's law.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 tonne $\times$ year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) via elastic DM-xenon-nucleus interactions in the XENONnT experiment. We combine datasets from the first and second science campaigns resulting in a total exposure of $3.1\;\text{tonne}\times\text{year}$. In a blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies above $3.8\,\mathrm{keV_{NR}}$, we find no significant excess above background. We set new upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section for WIMP masses above $10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with a minimum of $1.7\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ at $90\,\%$ confidence level for a WIMP mass of $30\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$. We achieve a best median sensitivity of $1.4\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a $41\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ WIMP. Compared to the result from the first XENONnT science dataset, we improve our sensitivity by a factor of up to 1.8.</description>

      <title>Near-instantaneous Atmospheric Retrievals and Model Comparison with FASTER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the dramatic improvement in the spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres demands a corresponding leap forward in our ability to analyze them: atmospheric retrievals need to be performed on thousands of spectra, applying to each large ensembles of models (that explore atmospheric chemistry, thermal profiles and cloud models) to identify the best one(s). In this limit, traditional Bayesian inference methods such as nested sampling become prohibitively expensive. We introduce FASTER (Fast Amortized Simulation-based Transiting Exoplanet Retrieval), a neural-network based method for performing atmospheric retrieval and Bayesian model comparison at a fraction of the computational cost of classical techniques. We demonstrate that the marginal posterior distributions of all parameters within a model as well as the posterior probabilities of the models we consider match those computed using nested sampling both on mock spectra, and for the real NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of WASP-39b. The true power of the FASTER framework comes from its amortized nature, which allows the trained networks to perform practically instantaneous Bayesian inference and model comparison over ensembles of spectra -- real or simulated -- at minimal additional computational cost. This offers valuable insight into the expected results of model comparison (e.g., distinguishing cloudy from cloud-free and isothermal from non-isothermal models), as well as their dependence on the underlying parameters, which is computationally unfeasible with nested sampling. This approach will constitute as large a leap in spectral analysis as the original retrieval methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo have proven to be.</description>

      <title>Unified $\chi^2$ discriminators for gravitational wave searches from compact coalescing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals of astrophysical origin are typically weak. This is because gravity is a weak force, the weakest among the four forces we know of. In order to detect GW signals, one must make differential measurements of effective lengths less than a thousandth of the size of a proton. In spite of the detectors achieving extraordinary sensitivity, the detector noise typically overwhelms the signal, so that GW signals are deeply buried in the data. The challenge to the data analyst is of extracting the GW signal from the noise, that is, first deciding whether a signal is present or not then if present, measuring its parameters.
  However, in the search for coalescing compact binary (CBC) signals, short-duration non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches) in the detector data significantly affect the search sensitivity. $\chi^2$ discriminators are therefore employed to mitigate their effect. We show that the underlying mathematical structure of any $\chi^2$ is a vector bundle over the signal manifold $\mathcal{P}$, that is, the manifold traced out by the signal waveforms in the Hilbert space of data segments $\mathcal{D}$. The $\chi^2$ is then defined as the square of the $L_2$ norm of the data vector projected onto a finite-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{S}$ (fibre) of $\mathcal{D}$ chosen orthogonal to the triggered template waveform. Any such fibre leads to a $\chi^2$ discriminator and the full vector bundle comprising the subspaces $\mathcal{S}$ and the base manifold $\mathcal{P}$ contitute the discriminator. We show that this structure paves the way for constructing effective discriminators against different morphologies of glitches. Here we specifically demonstrate our method on blip glitches, which can be modelled as sine-Gausians, which then generates an optimal $\chi^2$ statistic for blip glitches.</description>

      <title>FLARE: A Framework for Stellar Flare Forecasting using Stellar Physical Properties and Historical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.</description>

      <title>OMEGA/Mars Express: A new martian atmospheric dust hunter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While dust is a key parameter of Mars climate, its behaviour from one year to the next can appear erratic. This variability is notably related to Global Dust Storms (GDS) which occur only certain years with different onset, duration and intensity. The interannual variabilities of the dust cycle may notably explain some characteristics of Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), slope flows once thought to be caused by liquid water. Long-term monitoring of dust dynamics is thus required to better understand surface-atmosphere dust exchanges on Mars. Here we present a new method to detect atmospheric dust as a function of space and time in the OMEGA Near-InfraRed (NIR) dataset. This dataset covers more than three Martian years; it includes the 2007 GDS which seasonality differs from the preceding (2001) and later (2018) GDS. The method is based on the decrease of the atmospheric optical path caused by dust, that can be measured by OMEGA with the 2 $\mu$m CO$_2$ absorption band. This measure is converted to a 0.9 $\mu$m NIR dust optical depth using notably comparisons with Mars Exploration Rovers measurements. We derive dust optical depth maps and comment on the variability of the dust seasonal cycle before, during and after the 2007 GDS. We also compare OMEGA NIR optical depths to Thermal InfraRed (TIR) ones derived by other studies. We found a NIR/TIR dust extinction optical depth ratio of 1.8 on average, with some variations notably related to dust particle size. Finally, we show in the northern hemisphere that atmospheric dust and RSL activity is correlated. This may indicate that dust lifting or transport mechanisms working at regional scale also participate to local RSL activity.</description>

      <title>Spectral modelling of Cygnus A between 110 and 250 MHz. Impact on the LOFAR 21-cm signal power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the redshifted 21-cm signal from the the neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn is fundamental for understanding the physics of the early universe. One of the challenges that 21-cm experiments face is the contamination by bright foreground sources, such as Cygnus A, for which accurate spatial and spectral models are needed to minimise the residual contamination after their removal. In this work, we develop a new, high-resolution model of Cygnus A using Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations in the $110{-}250$ MHz range, improving upon previous models by incorporating physical spectral information through the forced-spectrum method during multi-frequency deconvolution. This approach addresses the limitations of earlier models by providing a more accurate representation of the complex structure and spectral behaviour of Cygnus A, including the spectral turnover in its brightest hotspots. The impact of this new model on the LOFAR 21-cm signal power spectrum is assessed by comparing it with both simulated and observed North Celestial Pole data sets. Significant improvements are observed in the cylindrical power spectrum along the Cygnus A direction, highlighting the importance of having spectrally accurate models of the brightest foreground sources. However, this improvement is washed out in the spherical power spectrum, where we measure differences of a few hundred mK at $k&lt;0.63\,h\,\text{cMpc}^{-1}$, but not statistically significant. The results suggest that other systematic effects must be mitigated before a substantial impact on 21-cm power spectrum can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Revised Point-Spread Functions for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present revised point-spread functions (PSFs) for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). These PSFs provide a robust estimate of the light diffracted by the meshes holding the entrance and focal plane filters and the light that is diffusely scattered over medium- to long-distance by the micro-roughness of the mirrors. We first calibrate the diffracted light using flare images. Our modeling of the diffracted light provides reliable determinations of the mesh parameters and finds that about 24 to 33% of the collected light is diffracted, depending on the AIA channel. Then, we fit for the diffuse scattered light using partially lunar occulted images. We find that the diffuse scattered light can be modeled as a superposition of two power law functions that scatter light over the entire length of the detector. The amount of diffuse scattered light ranges from 10 to 35 %, depending on the AIA channel. In total, AIA diffracts and scatters about 40 to 60 % of the collected light over medium to long distances. When correcting for this, bright image regions increase in intensity by about 30 %, dark image regions decrease in intensity by up to 90 %, and the associated differential emission measure analysis of solar features are affected accordingly. Finally, we compare the image reconstructions using our new PSFs to those using the AIA team PSFs and the PSFs of Poduval et al. (2013). We find that our PSFs outperform the others; our PSFs correct well for the flare diffraction pattern and predict accurately the long-distance scattered light in lunar occultations.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. MARFA employs an eleven-grid interpolation technique, enabling accurate and efficient computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about 5E-4 cm-1, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

      <title>RAMBO I: Project introduction and first results with uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hot stars can emit both coherent and incoherent non-thermal radio emission. Understanding the nature of these emissions and their connection to stellar rotation and magnetic field characteristics remains incomplete. The RAdio Magnetospheres of B and O stars (RAMBO) project aims to address this gap by systematically detecting and characterizing gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser radio emission in rapidly rotating magnetic hot stars. Using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first detection of radio emission from HD55522 at 650 MHz, confirming it as a new radio-bright magnetic hot star. This supports the predictions of the Centrifugal Breakout model, furthering its application in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms in centrifugal magnetospheres of hot stars. Additionally, we report non-detections for four other targets, improving sensitivity limits by a factor of a few compared to previous observations. These findings demonstrate the potential of RAMBO to uncover the complexities of radio emission in massive stars and highlight the need for broader, multi-wavelength observations to probe magnetospheric physics comprehensively. The sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array will enable significant advancements.</description>
