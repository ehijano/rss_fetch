      <title>Generation time for biexact functors and Koszul objects in triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the generation time that measures the number of cones necessary to obtain an object in a triangulated category from another object. This invariant is called level. We establish level inequalities for enhanced triangulated categories: One inequality concerns biexact functors of topological triangulated categories, another Koszul objects. In particular, this extends inequalities for the derived tensor product from commutative algebra to enhanced tensor triangulated categories. We include many examples.</description>

      <title>On the $\infty$-topos semantics of homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many introductions to homotopy type theory and the univalence axiom gloss over the semantics of this new formal system in traditional set-based foundations. This expository article, written as lecture notes to accompany a 3-part mini course delivered at the Logic and Higher Structures workshop at CIRM-Luminy, attempts to survey the state of the art, first presenting Voevodsky's simplicial model of univalent foundations and then touring Shulman's vast generalization, which provides an interpretation of homotopy type theory with strict univalent universes in any $\infty$-topos. As we will explain, this achievement was the product of a community effort to abstract and streamline the original arguments as well as develop new lines of reasoning.</description>

      <title>Gluing Data categories and gluing data functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to the concept of gluing in mathematics by introducing the notions of a gluing data category and a gluing data functor. Our work provides a formal categorical characterization of the notion of gluing in algebraic geometry. By using this characterization, we are able to describe gluing in a unified way that applies to a wide range of mathematical structures, including topological spaces, presheaves, sheaves, ringed topological spaces, locally ringed topological spaces, and schemes. Our results provide a fresh perspective on gluing that is both abstract and formal, offering a deeper understanding of this fundamental concept in mathematics.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck-Verdier duality in categories of bimodules and weak module functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various monoidal categories, including suitable representation categories of vertex operator algebras, admit natural Grothendieck-Verdier duality structures. We recall that such a Grothendieck-Verdier category comes with two tensor products which should be related by distributors obeying pentagon identities. We discuss in which circumstances these distributors are isomorphisms. This is achieved by taking the perspective of module categories over monoidal categories, using in particular the natural weak module functor structure of internal Homs and internal coHoms. As an illustration, we exhibit these concepts concretely in the case of categories of bimodules over associative algebras.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Universal Weil cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new Weil cohomology for smooth projective varieties over a field, universal among Weil cohomologies with values in rigid additive tensor categories. A similar universal problem for Weil cohomologies with values in rigid abelian tensor categories also has a solution. We give a variant for Weil cohomologies satisfying more axioms, like Weak and Hard Lefschetz. As a consequence, we get a different construction of Andr\'e's category of motives for motivated correspondences and show that it has a universal property. This theory extends over suitable bases.</description>
