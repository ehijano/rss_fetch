      <title>Continuous time ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensing using ultra-cold Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique for detecting ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio fields using a three-photon Rydberg excitation scheme in a continuously laser cooled sample of Rb-87 atoms. By measuring Autler-Townes splitting, we demonstrate resonant detection of UHF fields with frequency range 500-900 MHz through probing F -&gt; G transitions, achieving a lowest minimum detectable field of 2.5(6) mV/cm at 899 MHz. We also demonstrate continuous time detection of a modulated RF signal, with a 3 dB bandwidth of 4.7(4) kHz at a carrier frequency of 899 MHz. Our approach employs atom loss spectroscopy rather than electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which enables detection whilst the atomic sample is simultaneously laser cooled. We investigate this operating regime to determine the feasibility of combining the benefits of reduced thermal dephasing (and subsequent increased sensitivity) of cold atoms with the continuous operation associated with thermal atoms. Our continuous time detection scheme provides an advantage over existing pulsed cold atom systems as we avoid the slow experimental duty cycles typically associated with replenishing the cold atom ensemble. We characterize the excitation scheme by varying laser detunings and analyze the impact and limitations due to various broadening mechanisms on the detection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Filter circuit for suppression of electric-field noise in Rydberg-atom experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms are widely employed in precision spectroscopy and quantum information science. To minimize atomic decoherence caused by dc Stark effect, the electric field noise at the Rydberg atom location should be kept below $\sim 10$ mV/cm. Here we present a simple yet effective electronic circuit, referred to as a clamp switch, that allows one to realize such conditions. The clamp switch enables precise low-noise electric field control while allowing application of fast high-voltage ionization pulses through the same electrode(s), enabling atom detection via electric-field ionization and electron or ion counting. We outline the circuit design and analyze its noise suppression performance for both small and large input signals. In application examples, we employ the clamp switch to reduce the spectral width and increase the signal strength of a Rydberg line by a factor of two, to estimate the electric-field noise in the testing chamber, and to perform electric-field calibration using Rydberg Stark spectroscopy. The clamp switch improves coherence times and spectroscopic resolution in fundamental and applied quantum science research with Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Laser spectroscopy on the hyperfine structure and isotope shift of sympathetically cooled $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure of $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ ions in the nuclear ground state is investigated via laser spectroscopy of trapped Th$^{3+}$ ions that are sympathetically cooled by laser-cooled $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions in a linear Paul trap. The isotope shift to $^{230}$Th$^{3+}$ and the hyperfine constants for the magnetic dipole (A) and electric quadrupole (B) interactions for the 5F$_{5/2}$ and 6D$_{5/2}$ electronic states of $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ are determined. These measurements provide nuclear moments of $^{229}$Th with reduced uncertainty and serve as a preparation for improved hyperfine spectroscopy of the 8.4 eV nuclear isomeric state in $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ ions.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptography integrating an optical quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developments in scalable quantum networks rely critically on optical quantum memories, which are key components enabling the storage of quantum information. These memories play a pivotal role for entanglement distribution and long-distance quantum communication, with remarkable advances achieved in this context. However, optical memories have broader applications, and their storage and buffering capabilities can benefit a wide range of future quantum technologies. Here we present the first demonstration of a cryptography protocol incorporating an intermediate quantum memory layer. Specifically, we implement Wiesner's unforgeable quantum money primitive with a storage step, rather than as an on-the-fly procedure. This protocol imposes stringent requirements on storage efficiency and noise level to reach a secure regime. We demonstrate the implementation with polarization encoding of weak coherent states of light and a high-efficiency cold-atom-based quantum memory, and validate the full scheme. Our results showcase a major capability, opening new avenues for quantum memory utilization and network functionalities.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Atomic Birefringent Diffractive-Optical-Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between light and vapors in the presence of magnetic fields is fundamental to many quantum technologies and applications. Recently, the ability to geometrically confine atoms into periodic structures has enabled the creation of hybrid atomic-diffractive optical elements. However, the application of magnetic fields to such structures remains largely unexplored, offering potential for both fundamental and applied insights. Here, we present measurements of an atomic-diffractive optical element subject to magnetic fields. In contrast to the well-known polarization rotation in Faraday configurations, the diffractive atomic elements exhibit additional rotation terms, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, we find that the introduction of spatially varying magnetic fields leads to a reduction in fringe visibility, which can be leveraged for gradiometric applications. Our study sheds light on the fundamental magneto-optic properties of geometrically confined atomic systems and provides guidelines for chip-scale gradient magnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>A planar rotor trapped and coupled to the vibrational modes of an ion crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar rotors can be realized by confining molecular ions or charged nanoparticles together with atomic ions in a Paul trap. We study the case of molecular ions or charged nanoparticles that have an electric dipole moment which couples to modes of the common vibrational motion in the trap. We calculate the strength of the coupling with specific vibrational modes for rotor masses ranging from $10^2$ atomic units, as typical for diatomic molecules, to $10^{6}\,$ atomic units, corresponding to nanoclusters. Either, the coupling manifests as a resonant energy exchange between rotational states and one of ion crystal vibrational modes. Or, in the off-resonant case, the dipole-phonon coupling results in energy shifts. In both cases we discuss how the effect may be experimentally detected using sideband-resolved laser spectroscopy and measurements of decoherence.</description>

      <title>L-shell Photoionisation Cross Sections in the S^{+}, S^{2+}, S^{3+} Isonuclear Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present absolute L-shell photoionisation cross sections for the S+, S2+, S3+ions. The cross sections were obtained using the monochromatised photon beam delivered by the SOLEIL synchrotron source coupled with an ion beam extracted from an electron cyclotron resonance source (ECRIS) in the merged dual-beam configuration. The cross sections for single, double and triple ionisation were measured and combined to generate total photoionisation cross sections. For each of the S+, S2+, S3+ ions, the photon energy regions corresponding to the excitation and ionisation of a 2p or a 2s electron (175-230 eV) were investigated. The experimental results are interpreted with the help of multiconfigurational Dirac-Fock (MCDF) and Breit-Pauli R-Matrix (BPRM) or Dirac R-Matrix (DARC) theoretical calculations. The former generates photoabsorption cross sections from eigenenergies and eigenfunctions obtained by solving variationally the multiconfiguration Dirac Hamiltonian while the latter calculate cross sections for photon scattering by atoms. The cross sectional spectra feature rich resonance structures with narrow natural widths (typically less than 100 meV) due to 2p to nd excitations below and up to the 2p thresholds. This behaviour is consistent with the large number of inner-shell states based on correlation and spin-orbit mixed configurations having three open subshells. Strong and wide (typically 1 eV) Rydberg series of resonances due to 2s to np excitations dominate above the 2p threshold.</description>

      <title>Precision Spectroscopy of Antiprotonic Atoms for Investigation of Low-energy Antinucleon-nucleus Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a high-precision x-ray spectroscopy experiment of antiprotonic atoms to advance the understanding of low-energy antinucleon-nucleus interactions. The current leading model of antiproton-nucleus interactions is based on an optical potential with parameters derived from a global fit to antiprotonic atom x-ray data across the periodic table. However, the isovector parameter of this potential remains poorly constrained due to uncertainties in nucleon distributions of the nuclei. To address this, we propose to use calcium isotopes with well-studied nucleon distributions to minimize these uncertainties. A superconducting microcalorimeter detector will provide a resolution of 50-70 eV in the energy range of interest, allowing high precision determination of the isotope-dependent strong-interaction shifts and widths. The outcomes of the proposed experiment can be used to refine the model of antinucleon-nucleus interactions and provide critical data for future experiments searching for neutron-antineutron oscillations.</description>
