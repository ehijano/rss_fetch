      <title>Sample Path Properties of the Fractional Wiener--Weierstrass Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Wiener--Weierstrass bridges are a class of Gaussian processes that arise from replacing the trigonometric function in the construction of classical Weierstrass functions by a fractional Brownian bridge. We investigate the sample path properties of such processes, including local and uniform moduli of continuity, $\Phi$-variation, Hausdorff dimension, and location of the maximum. Our analysis relies heavily on upper and lower bounds of fractional integrals, where we establish a novel improvement of the classical Hardy--Littlewood inequality for fractional integrals of a special class of step functions.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of three mathematical approaches applied to the reversal of AMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the qualitative properties of a simple mathematical model inspired by antimicrobial resistance (AMR), focusing on the reversal of resistance. In particular, we analyze the model from three perspectives: ordinary differential equations (ODEs), stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Brownian motion, and fractional differential equations (FDEs) with Caputo temporal derivatives. Finally, we perform numerical experiments using data from Escherichia coli exposed to colistin to assess the validity of the qualitative properties of the model.</description>

      <title>Stochastic games of parental vaccination decision making and bounded rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent the spread of diseases. However, hesitancy and rejection of vaccines, particularly in childhood immunizations, pose challenges to vaccination efforts. In that case, according to rational decision-making and classical utility theory, parents weigh the costs of vaccinating against the costs of not vaccinating their children. Social norms influence these parental decision-making outcomes, further deviating their decisions from rationality. Additionally, variability in values of utilities stemming from stochasticity in parents' perceptions over time can lead to further deviations from rationality. In this paper, we employ independent white noises to represent stochastic fluctuations in parental perceptions of utility functions of the decisions over time as well as in the disease transmission rates. This approach leads to a system of stochastic differential equations of a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model coupled with a stochastic replicator equation. We explore the dynamics of these equations and identify new behaviors emerging from stochastic influences. Interestingly, incorporating stochasticity into the utility functions for vaccination and nonvaccination leads to a decision-making model that reflects the bounded rationality of humans. Noise, like social norms, is a two-sided sword that depends on the degree of bounded rationality of each group. We finally perform a stochastic optimal control as a discount to cost of vaccination to counteract bounded rationality.</description>

      <title>Sticky diffusions on star graphs : characterization and It{\^o} formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate continuous diffusions on star graphs with sticky behavior at the vertex. These are Markov processes with continuous paths having a positive occupation time at the vertex. We characterize sticky diffusions as time-changed nonsticky diffusions by adapting the classical technique of It{\^o} and McKean. We prove a form of It{\^o} formula, also known as Freidlin-Sheu formula, for this type of process. As an intermediate step, we also obtain a stochastic differential equation satisfied by the radial component of the process. These results generalize those already known for sticky diffusions on a half-line and skew sticky diffusions on the real line.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book aims to provide a brief overview of recent advancements in the theory of inverse problems for stochastic partial differential equations. In order to keep the content concise, we will only discuss the inverse problems of two typical classes of stochastic partial differential equations: second-order stochastic parabolic equations and secondorder stochastic hyperbolic equations. The main tool for studying these inverse problem is Carleman estimate. We do not intend to pursue any general treatment of the Carleman estimates themselves and choose direct arguments based on basic stochastic calculus, rather than more general sophisticated methods.
  As this field is still developing and there are many challenging issues to be addressed, the purpose of this book is not to serve as a comprehensive summary, but rather to spark interest and encourage further exploration in this area among readers. We prefer to present results that, from our perspective, include fresh and promising ideas. In cases where a complete mathematical theory is lacking, we only provide the available results. We do not intend for the current book to be encyclopedic in any sense, and the references are limited.</description>

      <title>Gaskets of $O(2)$ loop-decorated random planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for $n = 2$ the gaskets of critical rigid O(n) loop-decorated random planar maps are $3/2$-stable maps. The case $n = 2$ thus corresponds to the critical case in random planar maps. The proof relies on the Wiener-Hopf factorisation for random walks. Our techniques also provide a characterisation of weight sequences of critical $O(2)$ loop-decorated maps.</description>

      <title>On the Impossibility of Equating the Youden Index with Tjur's $R^2$-like metrics in $2\times2$ Tables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Hughes claimed an equivalence between Tjurs $R^2$ coefficient of discrimination and Youden index for assessing diagnostic test performance on $2\times 2$ contingency tables. We prove an impossibility result when averaging over binary outcomes (0s and 1s) under any continuous real-valued scoring rule. Our findings clarify the limitations of such a possible equivalence and highlights the distinct roles these metrics play in diagnostic test assessment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a variational formulation to define a generalized notion of perimeter, from which we derive abstract isoperimetric Cheeger's inequalities via gradient estimates on solutions of Poisson equations. Our abstract framework unifies many existing results and also allows us to prove a new transport inequality, which strengthens the already known transport-information inequality. Conversely, we also prove that Cheeger's inequality implies certain Calder{\'o}n-Zygmund gradient estimates.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error analysis for stochastic gradient optimization schemes with first and second order modified equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic gradient optimization schemes. Assuming that the objective function is strongly convex, we prove weak error estimates which are uniform in time for the error between the solution of the numerical scheme, and the solutions of continuous-time modified (or high-resolution) differential equations at first and second orders, with respect to the time-step size. At first order, the modified equation is deterministic, whereas at second order the modified equation is stochastic and depends on a modified objective function. We go beyond existing results where the error estimates have been considered only on finite time intervals and were not uniform in time. This allows us to then provide a rigorous complexity analysis of the method in the large time and small time step size regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for BSDEs with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the deep solver by Han, Jentzen, E (2018) to the case of forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process. We successfully apply our algorithm to option pricing problems in low and high dimension and discuss the applicability in the context of counterparty credit risk.</description>

      <title>Operadic approach to Markov processes with boundaries on the square lattice in dimension 2 and larger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov processes are omnipresent in any dimension, especially in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1 (which is often interpreted as "time"), for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: in particular, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. One of the consequences is the difficulty of the construction of infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice for such Markov processes. Such constructions are usually handled in an analytical way, with the DLR approach, guesses of approximate boundary conditions and Riesz theorem. We introduce in the present document new operadic tools to describe in a fully algebraic way Markov processes in any dimension on the square lattice. The main consequence is a natural description of probabilistic boundary weights in terms of matrix product representations, for which we generalize the eigenvector property of 1D invariant measures. This approach leads to new algebraic objects, with a local-to-global perspective, that are suitable for the use of Kolmogorov's extension theorem. Moreover, finite size Markov processes on the square lattice can also be seen as a toy case of statistical Euclidean field theory: our algebraic tools are related to other categorical approaches to field theory, with the advantage of providing concrete computational tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of systematic scan Glauber dynamics Ising model on the complete graph. On the complete graph $K_n$, at each time, $k \leq n$ vertices are chosen uniformly random and are updated one by one according to the uniformly randomly chosen permutations over the $k$ vertices. We show that if $k = o(n^{1/3})$, the high temperature regime $\beta &lt; 1$ exhibits cutoff phenomena. For critical temperature regime $\beta = 1$, We prove that the mixing time is of order $n^{3/2}k^{-1}$. For $\beta &gt; 1$, we prove the mixing time is of order $nk^{-1}\log n$ under the restricted dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for intransitive dice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intransitive dice $D^{(1)}, \ldots, D^{(\ell)}$ are dice such that $D^{(1)}$ has advantage when played against $D^{(2)}$, dice $D^{(2)}$ has advantage when played against $D^{(3)}$ and so on, up to $D^{(\ell)}$, which has advantage over $D^{(1)}$. In this twofold work, we first present (deterministic) results on the existence of general intransitive dice. Second and mainly, a central limit theorem for the vector of normalized victories of a die against the next one in the list when the faces of a die are i.i.d.\ random variables and all dice are independent, but different dice may have distinct distributions associated with them, as well as they may have distinct numbers of faces. Exploiting this central limit theorem, we derive two major consequences. First, we are able to obtain first order exponential asymptotics for the number of $\ell$-tuples of intransitive dice, when the number of faces of the dice grows. Second, we obtain a criterion to ensure that the asymptotic probability of observing intransitive dice is null, which applies to many cases, including all continuous distributions and many discrete ones.</description>

      <title>A flow-type scaling limit for random growth with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic Laplacian growth model, where a set $\mathbf{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{d}}$ grows according to a reflecting Brownian motion in $\mathbf{U}$ stopped at level sets of its boundary local time. We derive a scaling limit for the leading-order behavior of the growing boundary (i.e. "interface"). It is given by a geometric flow-type PDE. It is obtained by an averaging principle for the reflecting Brownian motion. We also show that this geometric flow-type PDE is locally well-posed, and its blow-up times correspond to changes in the diffeomorphism class of the growth model. Our results extend those of Dembo-Groisman-Huang-Sidoravicius '21, which restricts to star-shaped growth domains and radially outwards growth, so that in polar coordinates, the geometric flow transforms into a simple ODE with infinite lifetime. Also, we remove the "separation of scales" assumption that was taken in Dembo-Groisman-Huang-Sidoravicius '21; this forces us to understand the local geometry of the growing interface.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of the volume of loop O(n) quadrangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the volume of rigid loop-$O(n)$ quadrangulations with a boundary of length $2p$ in the non-generic critical regime. We prove that, as the half-perimeter $p$ goes to infinity, the volume scales in distribution to an explicit random variable. This limiting random variable is described in terms of the multiplicative cascades of Chen, Curien and Maillard arXiv:1702.06916, or alternatively (in the dilute case) as the law of the area of a unit-boundary $\gamma$-quantum disc, as determined by Ang and Gwynne arXiv:1903.09120, for suitable $\gamma$. Our arguments go through a classification of the map into several regions, where we rule out the contribution of bad regions to be left with a tractable portion of the map. One key observable for this classification is a Markov chain which explores the nested loops around a size-biased vertex pick in the map, making explicit the spinal structure of the discrete multiplicative cascade. We stress that our techniques enable us to include the boundary case $n=2$, that we define rigorously, and where the nested cascade structure is that of a critical branching random walk. In that case the scaling limit is given by the limit of the derivative martingale and is inverse-exponentially distributed, which answers a conjecture of arXiv:2005.06372v2.</description>

      <title>Two sided long-time optimization singular control problems for L\'evy processes and Dynkin's games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relationship between two sided discounted singular control problems and Dynkin games is established for real valued L\'evy processes. In addition, the solution of a two-sided ergodic singular control problem is obtained as the limit of the corresponding solution of the discounted one. With these results, we conclude that the optimal controls within the class of cadlag strategies can be in fact found in the class of reflecting barriers controls for both problems, and solved through some deterministic equations. To illustrate the results, three examples are given: compound Poisson processes with two-sided exponential jumps with and without Gaussian component, and stable processes.</description>

      <title>Spectrum occupies pseudospectrum for random matrices with diagonal deformation and variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with independent entries and a variance profile, as well as an additive deterministic diagonal deformation. We show that their empirical eigenvalue distribution converges to a limiting density as $n$ tends to infinity and that the support of this density in the complex plane exactly coincides with the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum in the consecutive limits $n \to \infty$ and $\varepsilon \to 0$. The limiting spectral measure is identified as the Brown measure of a deformed operator-valued circular element with the help of [arXiv:2409.15405].</description>

      <title>Unbiased approximation of the ergodic measure for piecewise $\alpha$-stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes arising in queueing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piecewise $\alpha$-stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes arising in queue networks usually do not have an explicit dissipation, which makes the related numerical methods such as Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme more difficult to analyze. We develop an EM scheme with decreasing step size $\Lambda=(\eta_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ to approximate their ergodic measures. This approximation does not have a bias and has a rate $\eta^{1/\alpha}_n$ in Wasserstein-1 distance. We show by the classical OU process that our convergence rate is optimal. We further prove the central limit theorem (CLT) and moderate derivation principle (MDP) for the empirical measure of these piecewise $\alpha$-stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. In addition, we use the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm to compute the Wasserstein-1 distance and conduct simulations for several concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Brown measures of deformed $L^\infty$-valued circular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$, where $a$ lies in a commutative tracial von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathfrak{c}$ is a $\cal{B}$-valued circular element. Under certain regularity conditions on $a$ and the covariance of $\mathfrak{c}$ this Brown measure has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the complex plane which is real analytic apart from jump discontinuities at the boundary of its support. With the exception of finitely many singularities this one-dimensional spectral edge is real analytic. We provide a full description of all possible edge singularities as well as all points in the interior, where the density vanishes. The edge singularities are classified in terms of their local edge shape while internal zeros of the density are classified in terms of the shape of the density locally around these points. We also show that each of these countably infinitely many singularity types occurs for an appropriate choice of $a$ when $\mathfrak{c}$ is a standard circular element. The Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$ arises as the empirical spectral distribution of a diagonally deformed non-Hermitian random matrix with independent entries when its dimension tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approaches to The Energy Equality in Forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore probabilistic approaches to the deterministic energy equality for the forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation on a torus. First, we prove the zero-noise dynamical large deviations for a corresponding stochastic SQG equation, where the lower bound matches the upper bound on a certain closure of the weak-strong uniqueness class for the deterministic forced SQG equation. Furthermore, we show that the energy equality for the deterministic SQG equation holds on arbitrary time-reversible subsets of the domain, where we match the upper bound and the lower bound. Conversely, the violation of the deterministic energy equality breaks the lower bound of large deviations. These results extend the existing techniques in Gess, Heydecker, and the second author \cite{arXiv:2311.02223} to generalized Sobolev spaces with negative indices. Finally, we provide an analysis of the restricted quasi-potential and prove a conditional equivalence compared to the rate function of large deviations for the Gaussian distribution. This suggests a potential connection between non-Gaussian large deviations in equilibrium for the stochastic SQG equation and the open problem regarding the uniqueness of the deterministic SQG equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations as gradient flows on the space of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09530v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general method to identify nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations (FPK equations) as gradient flows on the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a natural differential geometry. Our notion of gradient flow does not depend on any underlying metric structure such as the Wasserstein distance, but is derived from purely differential geometric considerations. We explicitly identify the associated entropy functions, which are not necessarily convex, and also the corresponding energy functionals, in particular their domains of definition. Furthermore, the latter functions are Lyapunov functions for the solutions of the FPK equations. Moreover, we show uniqueness results for such gradient flows, and we also prove that the gradient of $E$ is a gradient field on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be approximated by smooth gradient fields. These results cover classical and generalized porous media equations, where the latter have a generalized diffusivity function and a nonlinear transport-type first-order perturbation.</description>

      <title>DP-Coloring of Graphs from Random Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) of graphs is a generalization of list coloring that has been widely studied since its introduction by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in $2015$. Intuitively, DP-coloring generalizes list coloring by allowing the colors that are identified as the same to vary from edge to edge. Formally, DP-coloring of a graph $G$ is equivalent to an independent transversal in an auxiliary structure called a DP-cover of $G$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of random DP-covers and study the behavior of DP-coloring from such random covers. We prove a series of results about the probability that a graph is or is not DP-colorable from a random cover. These results support the following threshold behavior on random $k$-fold DP-covers as $\rho\to\infty$ where $\rho$ is the maximum density of a graph: graphs are non-DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently smaller than $\rho/\ln\rho$, and graphs are DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently larger than $\rho/\ln\rho$. Our results depend on $\rho$ growing fast enough and imply a sharp threshold for dense enough graphs. For sparser graphs, we analyze DP-colorability in terms of degeneracy. We also prove fractional DP-coloring analogs to these results.</description>

      <title>The Nonlocal Stefan Problem via a Martingale Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlocal Stefan problem, where the phase transition is described by a nonlocal diffusion as well as the change of enthalpy functions. By using a stochastic optimization approach introduced for the local case, we construct global-time weak solutions and give a probabilistic interpretation for the solutions. An important ingredient in our analysis is a probabilistic interpretation of the enthalpy and temperature variables in terms of a particle system. Our approach in particular establishes the connection between the parabolic obstacle problem and the Stefan Problem for the nonlocal diffusions. For the melting problem, we show that our solution coincides with those studied in the literature, and obtain a new exponential convergence result.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for Gaussian distributions: Exact solutions and Wasserstein errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14250v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we derive the analytical solutions of the backward SDE and the probability flow ODE. We prove that these solutions and their discretizations are all Gaussian processes, which allows us to compute exact Wasserstein errors induced by each error type for any sampling scheme. Monitoring convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features, our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</description>
