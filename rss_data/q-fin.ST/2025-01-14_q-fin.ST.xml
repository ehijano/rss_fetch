      <title>Parrondo's effects with aperiodic protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02987v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effectiveness of employing archetypal aperiodic sequencing -- namely Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and Rudin-Shapiro -- on the Parrondian effect. From a capital gain perspective, our results show that these series do yield a Parrondo's Paradox with the Thue-Morse based strategy outperforming not only the other two aperiodic strategies but benchmark Parrondian games with random and periodical ($AABBAABB\ldots$) switching as well. The least performing of the three aperiodic strategies is the Rudin-Shapiro. To elucidate the underlying causes of these results, we analyze the cross-correlation between the capital generated by the switching protocols and that of the isolated losing games. This analysis reveals that a strong anticorrelation with both isolated games is typically required to achieve a robust manifestation of Parrondo's effect. We also study the influence of the sequencing on the capital using the lacunarity and persistence measures. In general, we observe that the switching protocols tend to become less performing in terms of the capital as one increases the persistence and thus approaches the features of an isolated losing game. For the (log-)lacunarity, a property related to heterogeneity, we notice that for small persistence (less than 0.5) the performance increases with the lacunarity with a maximum around 0.4. In respect of this, our work shows that the optimization of a switching protocol is strongly dependent on a fine-tuning between persistence and heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>SpotV2Net: Multivariate Intraday Spot Volatility Forecasting via Vol-of-Vol-Informed Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces SpotV2Net, a multivariate intraday spot volatility forecasting model based on a Graph Attention Network architecture. SpotV2Net represents assets as nodes within a graph and includes non-parametric high-frequency Fourier estimates of the spot volatility and co-volatility as node features. Further, it incorporates Fourier estimates of the spot volatility of volatility and co-volatility of volatility as features for node edges, to capture spillover effects. We test the forecasting accuracy of SpotV2Net in an extensive empirical exercise, conducted with the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The results we obtain suggest that SpotV2Net yields statistically significant gains in forecasting accuracy, for both single-step and multi-step forecasts, compared to a panel heterogenous auto-regressive model and alternative machine-learning models. To interpret the forecasts produced by SpotV2Net, we employ GNNExplainer \citep{ying2019gnnexplainer}, a model-agnostic interpretability tool, and thereby uncover subgraphs that are critical to a node's predictions.</description>

      <title>Fitting the seven-parameter Generalized Tempered Stable distribution to the financial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes and implements a methodology to fit a seven-parameter Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution to financial data. The nonexistence of the mathematical expression of the GTS probability density function makes the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) inadequate for providing parameter estimations. Based on the function characteristic and the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), we provide a comprehensive approach to circumvent the problem and yield a good parameter estimation of the GTS probability. The methodology was applied to fit two heavily tailed data (Bitcoin and Ethereum returns) and two peaked data (S\&amp;P 500 and SPY ETF returns). For each index, the estimation results show that the six-parameter estimations are statistically significant except for the local parameter, $\mu$. The goodness-of-fit was assessed through Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, and Pearson's chi-squared statistics. While the two-parameter geometric Brownian motion (GBM) hypothesis is always rejected, the GTS distribution fits significantly with a very high p-value; and outperforms the Kobol, Carr-Geman-Madan-Yor, and Bilateral Gamma distributions.</description>

      <title>How to verify that a given process is a L\'evy-Driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that a L\'evy-Driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (or CAR(1)) processes is observed at discrete times $0$, $h$, $2h$,$\cdots$ $[T/h]h$. We introduce a step-by-step methodological approach on how a person would verify the model assumptions. The methodology involves estimating the model parameters and approximating the driving process. We demonstrate how to use the increments of the approximated driving process, along with the estimated parameters, to test the assumptions that the CAR(1) process is L\'evy-driven. We then show how to test the hypothesis that the CAR(1) process belongs to a specified class of L\'evy processes. The performance of the tests is illustrated through multiple simulations. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply the methodology step-by-step to a variety of economic and financial data examples.</description>
