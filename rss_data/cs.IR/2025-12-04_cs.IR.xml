      <title>BookRAG: A Hierarchical Structure-aware Index-based Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Complex Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an effective method to boost the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the question answering (QA) task, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which queries highly relevant information from external complex documents, has attracted tremendous attention from both industry and academia. Existing RAG approaches often focus on general documents, and they overlook the fact that many real-world documents (such as books, booklets, handbooks, etc.) have a hierarchical structure, which organizes their content from different granularity levels, leading to poor performance for the QA task. To address these limitations, we introduce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information. Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intricate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval workflow. Extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that BookRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines in both retrieval recall and QA accuracy while maintaining competitive efficiency.</description>

      <title>LLM as Explainable Re-Ranker for Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation systems has recently gained traction. Traditional recommendation systems often lack explainability and suffer from issues such as popularity bias. Previous research has also indicated that LLMs, when used as standalone predictors, fail to achieve accuracy comparable to traditional models. To address these challenges, we propose to use LLM as an explainable re-ranker, a hybrid approach that combines traditional recommendation models with LLMs to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We constructed a dataset to train the re-ranker LLM and evaluated the alignment between the generated dataset and human expectations. Leveraging a two-stage training process, our model significantly improved NDCG, a key ranking metric. Moreover, the re-ranker outperformed a zero-shot baseline in ranking accuracy and interpretability. These results highlight the potential of integrating traditional recommendation models with LLMs to address limitations in existing systems and pave the way for more explainable and fair recommendation frameworks.</description>

      <title>M3DR: Towards Universal Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems have shown strong progress in aligning visual and textual content for semantic search. However, most existing approaches remain heavily English-centric, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual contexts. In this work, we present M3DR (Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval), a framework designed to bridge this gap across languages, enabling applicability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. M3DR leverages synthetic multilingual document data and generalizes across different vision-language architectures and model sizes, enabling robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations. We further introduce a comprehensive benchmark that captures real-world multilingual scenarios, evaluating models under monolingual, multilingual, and mixed-language settings. M3DR generalizes across both single dense vector and ColBERT-style token-level multi-vector retrieval paradigms. Our models, NetraEmbed and ColNetraEmbed achieve state-of-the-art performance with ~150% relative improvements on cross-lingual retrieval.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Boolean Matrix Factorization using Integer Programming and Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03807v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) approximates a given binary input matrix as the product of two smaller binary factors. Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging.</description>

      <title>Learning to Comparison-Shop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online marketplaces like Airbnb, users frequently engage in comparison shopping before making purchase decisions. Despite the prevalence of this behavior, a significant disconnect persists between mainstream e-commerce search engines and users' comparison needs. Traditional ranking models often evaluate items in isolation, disregarding the context in which users compare multiple items on a search results page. While recent advances in deep learning have sought to improve ranking accuracy, diversity, and fairness by encoding listwise context, the challenge of aligning search rankings with user comparison shopping behavior remains inadequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking architecture - Learning-to-Comparison-Shop (LTCS) System - that explicitly models and learns users' comparison shopping behaviors. Through extensive offline and online experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant gains in key business metrics - improving NDCG by 1.7% and boosting booking conversion rate by 0.6% in A/B testing - while also enhancing user experience. We also compare our model against state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate that LTCS significantly outperforms them.</description>

      <title>Tuning for TraceTarnish: Techniques, Trends, and Testing Tangible Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we more rigorously evaluated our attack script $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, which leverages adversarial stylometry principles to anonymize the authorship of text-based messages. To ensure the efficacy and utility of our attack, we sourced, processed, and analyzed Reddit comments--comments that were later alchemized into $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data--to gain valuable insights. The transformed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data was then further augmented by $\textit{StyloMetrix}$ to manufacture stylometric features--features that were culled using the Information Gain criterion, leaving only the most informative, predictive, and discriminative ones. Our results found that function words and function word types ($L\_FUNC\_A$ $\&amp;$ $L\_FUNC\_T$); content words and content word types ($L\_CONT\_A$ $\&amp;$ $L\_CONT\_T$); and the Type-Token Ratio ($ST\_TYPE\_TOKEN\_RATIO\_LEMMAS$) yielded significant Information-Gain readings. The identified stylometric cues--function-word frequencies, content-word distributions, and the Type-Token Ratio--serve as reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs), revealing when a text has been deliberately altered to mask its true author. Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. "In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one." Armed with this understanding, we framed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack.</description>

      <title>AR-Med: Automated Relevance Enhancement in Medical Search via LLM-Driven Information Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03737</link>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable search on online healthcare platforms is critical for user safety and service efficacy. Traditional methods, however, often fail to comprehend complex and nuanced user queries, limiting their effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution, offering powerful semantic understanding to bridge this gap. Despite their potential, deploying LLMs in this high-stakes domain is fraught with challenges, including factual hallucinations, specialized knowledge gaps, and high operational costs. To overcome these barriers, we introduce \textbf{AR-Med}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}elevance assessment for \textbf{Med}ical search that has been successfully deployed at scale on the Online Medical Delivery Platforms. AR-Med grounds LLM reasoning in verified medical knowledge through a retrieval-augmented approach, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To enable efficient online service, we design a practical knowledge distillation scheme that compresses large teacher models into compact yet powerful student models. We also introduce LocalQSMed, a multi-expert annotated benchmark developed to guide model iteration and ensure strong alignment between offline and online performance. Extensive experiments show AR-Med achieves an offline accuracy of over 93\%, a 24\% absolute improvement over the original online system, and delivers significant gains in online relevance and user satisfaction. Our work presents a practical and scalable blueprint for developing trustworthy, LLM-powered systems in real-world healthcare applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems have become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making, highlighting their growing impact in various domains. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of machine learning models in recommender systems has raised significant concerns regarding user privacy and security. As compliance with privacy regulations becomes more critical, there is a pressing need to address the issue of recommendation unlearning, i.e., eliminating the memory of specific training data from the learned recommendation models. Despite its importance, traditional machine unlearning methods are ill-suited for recommendation unlearning due to the unique challenges posed by collaborative interactions and model parameters. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in recommendation unlearning, exploring the design principles, challenges, and methodologies associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different recommendation unlearning approaches, followed by a summary of widely used benchmarks and metrics for evaluation. By reviewing the current state of research, this survey aims to guide the development of more efficient, scalable, and robust recommendation unlearning techniques. Furthermore, we identify open research questions in this field, which could pave the way for future innovations not only in recommendation unlearning but also in a broader range of unlearning tasks across different machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Access Paths for Efficient Ordering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the \texttt{LLM ORDER BY} semantic operator as a logical abstraction and conduct a systematic study of its physical implementations. First, we propose several improvements to existing semantic sorting algorithms and introduce a semantic-aware external merge sort algorithm. Our extensive evaluation reveals that no single implementation offers universal optimality on all datasets. From our evaluations, we observe a general test-time scaling relationship between sorting cost and the ordering quality for comparison-based algorithms. Building on these insights, we design a budget-aware optimizer that utilizes heuristic rules, LLM-as-Judge evaluation, and consensus aggregation to dynamically select the near-optimal access path for LLM ORDER BY. In our extensive evaluations, our optimizer consistently achieves ranking accuracy on par with or superior to the best static methods across all benchmarks. We believe that this work provides foundational insights into the principled optimization of semantic operators essential for building robust, large-scale LLM-powered analytic systems.</description>

      <title>Mobile-Agent-RAG: Driving Smart Multi-Agent Coordination with Contextual Knowledge Empowerment for Long-Horizon Mobile Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile agents show immense potential, yet current state-of-the-art (SoTA) agents exhibit inadequate success rates on real-world, long-horizon, cross-application tasks. We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Procedural Learning From Experience for AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.</description>
