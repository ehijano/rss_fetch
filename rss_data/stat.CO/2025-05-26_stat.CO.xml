      <title>PolyStan: PolyChord nested sampling and Bayesian evidences for Stan models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling from multi-modal distributions and estimating marginal likelihoods, also known as evidences and normalizing constants, are well-known challenges in statistical computation. They can be overcome by nested sampling, which evolves a set of live points through a sequence of distributions upwards in likelihood. We introduce PolyStan -- a nested sampling inference engine for Stan. PolyStan provides a Stan interface to the PolyChord nested sampling algorithm using bridgestan. PolyStan introduces a new user-base to nested sampling algorithms and provides a black-box method for sampling from challenging distributions and computing marginal likelihoods. We demonstrate the robustness of nested sampling on several degenerate and multi-modal problems, comparing it to bridge sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Liouville PDE-based sliced-Wasserstein flow for fair regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein flow (SWF), a nonparametric and implicit generative gradient flow, is applied to fair regression. We have improved the SWF in a few aspects. First, the stochastic diffusive term from the Fokker-Planck equation-based Monte Carlo is transformed to Liouville partial differential equation (PDE)-based transport with density estimation, however, without the diffusive term. Now, the computation of the Wasserstein barycenter is approximated by the SWF barycenter with the prescription of Kantorovich potentials for the induced gradient flow to generate its samples. These two efforts improve the convergence in training and testing SWF and SWF barycenters with reduced variance. Applying the generative SWF barycenter for fair regression demonstrates competent profiles in the accuracy-fairness Pareto curves.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Online Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for functionals based on asymptotically normal estimators is a classical topic in statistical inference. The simplest and in many cases optimal inference procedure is the Wald interval or the likelihood ratio test, both of which require an estimator and an estimate of the asymptotic variance of the estimator. Estimators obtained from online/sequential algorithms forces one to consider the computational aspects of the inference problem, i.e., one cannot access all of the data as many times as needed. Several works on this topic explored the online estimation of asymptotic variance. In this article, we propose computationally efficient, rate-optimal, and asymptotically valid confidence regions based on the output of online algorithms {\em without} estimating the asymptotic variance. As a special case, this implies inference from any algorithm that yields an asymptotically normal estimator. We focus our efforts on stochastic gradient descent with Polyak averaging to understand the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Conditional Distributions of Simplified Vines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplified vine copulas are flexible tools over standard multivariate distributions for modeling and understanding different dependence properties in high-dimensional data. Their conditional distributions are of utmost importance, from statistical learning to graphical models. However, the conditional densities of vine copulas and, thus, vine distributions cannot be obtained in closed form without integration for all possible sets of conditioning variables. We propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based approach of using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample from any conditional distribution of arbitrarily specified simplified vine copulas and thus vine distributions. We show its accuracy through simulation studies and analyze data of multiple maize traits such as flowering times, plant height, and vigor. Use cases from predicting traits to estimating conditional Kendall's tau are presented.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of variance heterogeneity and misspecification in mixed-effects location-scale models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear Mixed Model (LMM) is a common statistical approach to model the relation between exposure and outcome while capturing individual variability through random effects. However, this model assumes the homogeneity of the error term's variance. Breaking this assumption, known as homoscedasticity, can bias estimates and, consequently, may change a study's conclusions. If this assumption is unmet, the mixed-effect location-scale model (MELSM) offers a solution to account for within-individual variability. Our work explores how LMMs and MELSMs behave when the homoscedasticity assumption is not met. Further, we study how misspecification affects inference for MELSM. To this aim, we propose a simulation study with longitudinal data and evaluate the estimates' bias and coverage. Our simulations show that neglecting heteroscedasticity in LMMs leads to loss of coverage for the estimated coefficients and biases the estimates of the standard deviations of the random effects. In MELSMs, scale misspecification does not bias the location model, but location misspecification alters the scale estimates. Our simulation study illustrates the importance of modelling heteroscedasticity, with potential implications beyond mixed effect models, for generalised linear mixed models for non-normal outcomes and joint models with survival data.</description>

      <title>A New Forward Discriminant Analysis Framework Based On Pillai's Trace and ULDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a traditional classification tool, suffers from limitations such as sensitivity to noise and computational challenges when dealing with non-invertible within-class scatter matrices. Traditional stepwise LDA frameworks, which iteratively select the most informative features, often exacerbate these issues by relying heavily on Wilks' $\Lambda$, potentially causing premature stopping of the selection process. This paper introduces a novel forward discriminant analysis framework that integrates Pillai's trace with Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) to address these challenges, and offers a unified and stand-alone classifier. Through simulations and real-world datasets, the new framework demonstrates effective control of Type I error rates and improved classification accuracy, particularly in cases involving perfect group separations. The results highlight the potential of this approach as a robust alternative to the traditional stepwise LDA framework.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>

      <title>Bayesian sample size calculations for external validation studies of risk prediction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary sample size calculations for external validation of risk prediction models require users to specify fixed values of assumed model performance metrics alongside target precision levels (e.g., 95% CI widths). However, due to the finite samples of previous studies, our knowledge of true model performance in the target population is uncertain, and so choosing fixed values represents an incomplete picture. As well, for net benefit (NB) as a measure of clinical utility, the relevance of conventional precision-based inference is doubtful. In this work, we propose a general Bayesian framework for multi-criteria sample size considerations for prediction models for binary outcomes. For statistical metrics of performance (e.g., discrimination and calibration), we propose sample size rules that target desired expected precision or desired assurance probability that the precision criteria will be satisfied. For NB, we propose rules based on Optimality Assurance (the probability that the planned study correctly identifies the optimal strategy) and Value of Information (VoI) analysis. We showcase these developments in a case study on the validation of a risk prediction model for deterioration of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Compared to the conventional sample size calculation methods, a Bayesian approach requires explicit quantification of uncertainty around model performance, and thereby enables flexible sample size rules based on expected precision, assurance probabilities, and VoI. In our case study, calculations based on VoI for NB suggest considerably lower sample sizes are needed than when focusing on precision of calibration metrics.</description>

      <title>Model Selection for Gaussian-gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts Using Dendrograms of Mixing Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models constitute a widely utilized class of ensemble learning approaches in statistics and machine learning, known for their flexibility and computational efficiency. They have become integral components in numerous state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures, particularly for analyzing heterogeneous data across diverse domains. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of model selection, especially concerning the optimal number of mixture components or experts, remains limited and poses significant challenges. These challenges primarily stem from the inclusion of covariates in both the Gaussian gating functions and expert networks, which introduces intrinsic interactions governed by partial differential equations with respect to their parameters. In this paper, we revisit the concept of dendrograms of mixing measures and introduce a novel extension to Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE models that enables consistent estimation of the true number of mixture components and achieves the pointwise optimal convergence rate for parameter estimation in overfitted scenarios. Notably, this approach circumvents the need to train and compare a range of models with varying numbers of components, thereby alleviating the computational burden, particularly in high-dimensional or deep neural network settings. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately recovering the number of experts. It outperforms common criteria such as the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood, while achieving optimal convergence rates for parameter estimation and accurately approximating the regression function.</description>
