      <title>Cascades of Lorenz attractors in the Shimizu-Morioka model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorenz attractor is the first example of a robustly chaotic non-hyperbolic attractor. Each orbit of such an attractor has a positive top Lyapunov exponent, and this property persists under small perturbations despite possible bifurcations of the attractor. In this paper, we study the boundary of the Lorenz attractor existence region in the Shimizu-Morioka model. As in the classical Lorenz system, a part of the boundary is associated with the curve $l_{A=0}$, where the first tangency between some Lyapunov subspaces occurs along orbits of the attractor. However, in the Lorenz system, the curve $l_{A=0}$ forms the exact boundary of the Lorenz attractor existence region. Beyond this curve, the attractor is not robustly chaotic, although it may be indistinguishable from the Lorenz attractor in simple numerical experiments. In the Shimizu-Morioka model, the curve $l_{A=0}$ is divided into two parts. The Lorenz attractor existence region adjoins $l_{A=0}$ along the first part of this curve, as in the Lorenz system. Near the second part, as we show, the region of the existence of the Lorenz attractor is fractal. We describe two infinite cascades of disjoint subregions with the Lorenz attractor. One cascade occurs along the curve $l_{A=0}$, another -- in the transversal direction. We show that along the cascades, the Lorenz attractor undergoes ``doubling bifurcations'', leading to a complication of its topological structure.</description>

Abstract: In this note we unify the results of A.C. Lazer and P.O. Frederickson [3], A.C. Lazer [6], A.C. Lazer and D.E. Leach [7], J.M. Alonso and R. Ortega [1], and P. Korman and Y.

      <title>Stochastic Modelling and Analysis of Within-Farm Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Dynamics in Dairy Cattle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has expanded its host range with recent detections in dairy cattle, raising critical concerns regarding within-herd persistence and cross-species spillover. This study develops a stochastic $SEI_sI_aR-B$ compartmental model to analyse HPAI transmission, explicitly accounting for environmental pathogen reservoirs and noise intensities through Wiener processes. The positivity and boundedness of solutions are established, and the disease-free and endemic equilibria are analytically derived. The basic reproduction number is determined using the next-generation matrix method. Numerical simulations confirm that the model dynamics are consistent with theoretical analysis and illustrate how stochastic fluctuations significantly influence disease persistence. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) identifies the transmission rate from asymptomatic infectious cattle ($\beta_a$) as the primary driver of transmission. The model effectively captures the dynamics of environmental variability affecting HPAI spread, suggesting that effective control strategies must prioritise the early detection and isolation of asymptomatic carriers alongside environmental management.</description>

      <title>Metric mean dimension and the variational principle for actions of amenable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric mean dimension is a dynamical counterpart of the box dimension in fractal geometry to characterize the topological complexity of infinite entropy systems. The classical variational principle states that topological entropy equals the supremum of measure-theoretic entropy over the set of invariant measures. Lindenstrauss and Tsukamoto proved that this variational principle fails for metric mean dimension in terms of rate-distortion dimensions. For the actions of amenable groups, we define a new measure-theoretic metric mean dimension for invariant measures and establish a classical-type variational principle for metric mean dimension. In particular, we extend the Lindenstrauss-Tsukamoto variational principles to the classical variational principle by defining modified rate-distortion dimensions.
  As applications, for systems with zero metric mean dimension, we introduce infinite entropy dimensions in both topological and measure-theoretic settings, and relate them via a variational principle. For systems with positive metric mean dimension, we introduce local metric mean dimension from a local perspective, and relate it to the metric mean dimension of the whole phase space via variational principles.</description>

      <title>Topological pressure and equilibrium state for certain correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Miller-Akin1999}, Miller and Akin investigated the invariant measures for correspondences, which are also known as upper semi-continuous set-valued maps. Recently, the variational principle and thermodynamic formalism for forward expansive correspondences were studied by Li, Li and Zhang \cite{Xiaoran Li-Zhiqiang Li-Yiwei Zhang2023}. In this paper, the invariant measures and the associated transition probability kernels are explicitly expressed for certain correspondences satisfying the assumptions in \cite{Xiaoran Li-Zhiqiang Li-Yiwei Zhang2023} via the equilibrium states of some particular potentials. Let $T$ be a correspondence on a closed connected Riemannian manifold generated by finite $C^{2}$-expanding endomorphisms. When the generators of $T$ have no coincidence point, a locally H\"{o}lder continuous potential $\phi$ of two variables is defined via the Jacobians of the generators. The pressure of $\phi$ and its equilibrium state $(\mu, \mathcal{Q})$ are obtained, where $\mu$ is a $T$-invariant measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the volume and $\mathcal{Q}$ is the associated transition probability kernel satisfying $\mu\mathcal{Q}=\mu$. For the correspondence $T$ on the torus whose generators have coincidence points, the variational topological pressures for measurable potentials are introduced and the corresponding equilibrium states are considered. Moreover, the uniqueness of the equilibrium states of correspondences is considered via the natural extensions.</description>

      <title>On equilibrium states for certain partially hyperbolic endomorphisms with one-dimensional center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the equilibrium states for a non-degenerate $ C^2 $ partially hyperbolic endomorphism $f$ on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ with one-dimensional center bundle are investigated. Applying the criterion of Climenhaga-Thompson (\cite{CT21}) and the method of Mongez-Pacifico (\cite{Mongez}), we use the techniques of inverse limit to obtain the uniqueness and robustness of equilibrium states for $f$ and any H\"{o}lder continuous potential satisfying certain conditions about the unstable pressure and stable pressure.</description>

      <title>Crossing-sliding bifurcations in planar $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Filippov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the crossing-sliding bifurcations of planar Filippov systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry. Such bifurcations are triggered by the perturbations of a critical crossing cycle and constitute an important class of discontinuity-induced bifurcations. By constructing transition maps and developing a decomposition theorem of functions to overcome the difficulty of describing bifurcation boundaries in multi-parameter settings, we systematically characterize the codimension-one and codimension-two bifurcation scenarios through the explicit statement of non-degenerate conditions and the presentation of the corresponding bifurcation diagrams. The asymptotic properties of all bifurcation curves are also derived.</description>

      <title>Empirical Laws for Iterated Correlation Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete iteration obtained by repeatedly applying the Pearson correlation operator to a real matrix. Each step centers every row, normalizes each centered row to unit Euclidean norm, and forms the Gram matrix of the resulting rows. This defines a nonlinear self-map on the space of correlation matrices that underlies classical procedures such as CONCOR and GAP. Despite its long history and simple formulation, the global behavior of this iteration has remained analytically unresolved. We develop a geometric formulation that separates the dynamics into strongly contractive directions associated with row means and norms, and nearly isometric directions tangent to the mean-zero, unit-norm row manifold. This structure explains why local linear convergence results do not extend to a global contraction theorem. Empirically, we conduct a large-scale numerical study over dimensions \(n\in[3,2000]\) and thousands of random initializations using a dimension-uniform experimental framework. Using the Frobenius step size, the entrywise step size, and the one-step contraction ratio, we identify four universal empirical laws that persist uniformly across all tested dimensions: a sharp first-step contraction, quasi-monotone decay with bounded overshoots and finite total variation, a universal relationship between contraction ratio and step size, and convergence in a uniformly bounded number of iterations. These findings provide the first quantitative, dimension-uniform description of the iteration and establish a precise benchmark for future global analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics with self-exciting factor for Monkeypox transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic human-rodent compartment model for Mpox transmission that combines diffusion noise with Hawkes self-exciting jumps in the human infection dynamics. Including Hawkes processes allows, for instance, to model the short but significant spikes in transmission happening after crowded events. For the coupled human-rodent system, we prove global existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions, derive a basic reproduction number R_0 that guarantees almost sure extinction when R_0 &lt; 1, and obtain explicit persistence-in-the-mean conditions for both infected rodents and humans, which define persistence thresholds for the joint dynamics. Numerical experiments show how clustered human transmission events, environmental variability and control measures shift these thresholds and shape the frequency and size of Mpox outbreaks.</description>

Abstract: We present the first explicit example of an interval exchange transformation with flips (FIET) possessing three distinct invariant ergodic measures. The proof is based on a generalization of M. Keane's method, using the Rauzy induction adapted for FIETs, which contributes to the study of the ergodic properties of this class of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Consistent Parametric Model Order Reduction by Matrix Interpolation for Varying Underlying Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric model order reduction (pMOR) is a powerful tool for accelerating finite element (FE) simulations while maintaining parametric dependencies. For geometric parameters, pMOR by matrix interpolation is a well-suited approach because it does not require an affine representation of the parametric dependency, which is often not available for geometric parameters. However, the method requires that the underlying FE mesh has the same number of degrees of freedom and the same topology for all parameter configurations. This requirement can be difficult or even impossible to achieve for large parameter ranges or when automatic meshing is used. In this work, we propose a novel framework for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes. The key idea is to understand the sampled reduced bases as continuous displacement fields that can be represented in different discretizations. By using mesh morphing and basis interpolation, the sampled reduced bases described in varying meshes can all be represented in terms of one reference mesh. This not only allows for performing pMOR by matrix interpolation, but also enables comparing the subspaces that the reduced bases span, which is important to detect strong changes that could lead to inconsistencies in the reduced operators. For mesh morphing, two strategies, namely morphing by spring analogy with elastic hardening and radial basis function morphing, were implemented and tested. Numerical experiments on a beam-shaped plate and a plate with a hole for one- and two-dimensional parameter spaces show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy for both morphing methods and performs significantly better than two existing approaches for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes.</description>

      <title>On quasimorphisms and distortion in homeomorphism groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth compact oriented manifold, and $Homeo_0(M,\mu)$ the group of homeomorphisms of $M$ supported away from $\partial M$, which preserve a Borel probability measure $\mu$ induced by a volume form on $M$, and are isotopic to the identity.
  In this paper, we identify those Gambaudo-Ghys and Polterovich quasimorphisms $\Psi\colon Diff_0(M,\mu)\to R$ which extend $C^0$-continuously to $Homeo_0(M,\mu)$ as quasimorphisms, and to $Homeo_0(M)$ as group cochains whose differentials are semi-bounded cocycles. We present several applications of this result which include unboundedness of certain bi-invariant metric on the commutator subgroup of $Homeo_0(M,\mu)$, and conditions under which a homeomorphism in $Homeo_0(M)$ is undistorted.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Dual MPC using Active Inference: An Autonomous Vehicle Usecase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing controllers under uncertainty requires balancing the need to explore system dynamics with the requirement to maintain reliable control performance. Dual control addresses this challenge by selecting actions that both regulate the system and actively gather informative data. This paper investigates the use of the Active Inference framework, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, for developing a dual model-predictive controller (MPC). To identify and quantify uncertainty, we introduce an online sparse semi-parametric Gaussian Process model that combines the flexibility of nonparametric with the efficiency of parametric learning for real-time updates. By applying the expected free energy functional to this adaptive probabilistic model, we derive an MPC objective that incorporates an information-theoretic term, which captures uncertainty arising from both the learned model and measurement noise. This formulation leads to a stochastic optimal control problem for dual controller design, which is solved using a novel dynamic-programming-based method. Simulation results on a vehicle use case demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances autonomous driving control performance across different settings and scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study compact hyperbolic surfaces and multiplicative observables, establishing a large-scale analogue of Zelditch's quantum mixing theorem with hypotheses that hold for both arithmetic and Weil-Petersson random surfaces of large genus. This complements the large-scale quantum ergodicity theorems of Le Masson and Sahlsten, which themselves serve as large-scale analogues of the quantum ergodicity theorem of Shnirelman, Zelditch, and de Verdiere, thereby providing a more complete picture of the asymptotic behaviour of observables in the large-scale limit. Our approach does not rely on ball averaging operators or Nevo's ergodic theorem. Instead, we introduce a new method based on the hyperbolic wave equation and the quantitative exponential mixing of the geodesic flow established by Ratner and Matheus.</description>

      <title>Learning the climate of dynamical systems with state-space systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space systems encompass a broad class of algorithms used for modeling and forecasting time series. For such systems to be effective, two objectives must be met: (i) accurate point forecasts of the time series must be produced, and (ii) the long-term statistical behaviour of the underlying data-generating process must be replicated. The latter objective, often referred to as learning the climate, is closely related to the task of producing accurate distribution forecasts. Empirical evidence shows that distribution forecasts are far more stable than point forecasts, which are sensitive to initial conditions. In this work, we rigorously study this phenomenon for state-space systems. The main result shows that, if the underlying data-generating process is structurally stable and possesses a mixing or an attracting measure, then a sufficiently regular initial probability distribution remains close to the true future distribution at arbitrarily long time horizons when forecasted by a $C^1-$close state-space proxy. Thus, under these conditions, learning the climate of a dynamic process with a universal family of state-space systems is feasible with arbitrarily high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We propose a notion of conditioned stochastic stability of invariant measures on repellers: we consider whether quasi-ergodic measures of absorbing Markov processes, generated by random perturbations of the deterministic dynamics and conditioned upon survival in a neighbourhood of a repeller, converge to an invariant measure in the zero-noise limit. Under suitable choices of the random perturbation, we find that equilibrium states on uniformly expanding repellers are conditioned stochastically stable. In the process, we establish a rigorous foundation for the existence of ``natural measures'', which were proposed by Kantz and Grassberger in 1984 to aid the understanding of chaotic transients.</description>

      <title>Sufficient condition for dispersal-induced growth on dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population spreading across a finite number of sites. Individuals can move from one site to the other according to a network (oriented links between the sites) that vary periodically over time. On each site, the population experiences a growth rate which is also periodically time varying. Recently, this kind of models have been extensively studied, using various technical tools to derive precise necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system (ie the local growth rate on each site, the time period and the strength of migration between the sites) for the population to grow. In the present paper, we take a completely different approach: using elementary comparison results between linear systems, we give sufficient condition for the growth of the population This condition is easy to check and can be applied in a broad class of examples. In particular, in the case when all sites are sinks (ie, in the absence of migration, the population become extinct in each site), we prove that when our condition of growth if satisfied, the population grows when the time period is large and for values of the migration strength that are exponentially small with respect to the time period, which answers positively to a conjecture stated by Katriel.</description>

      <title>Correlation Number for Potentials with Entropy Gaps and Cusped Hitchin Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a correlation number for two strictly positive, locally H\"older continuous, independent potentials with strong entropy gaps at infinity on a topologically mixing countable state Markov shift with BIP. We define in this way a correlation number for pairs of cusped Hitchin representations. Furthermore, we explore the connection between the correlation number and the Manhattan curve, along with several rigidity properties of this correlation number.</description>

      <title>On Rapid mixing for random walks on nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold under mild assumptions on the size of $m$. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show $m=2$ suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in \cite{D02} about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Computable thermodynamic formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of thermodynamic formalism from the perspective of computable analysis, with a special focus on the computability of equilibrium states. Specifically, we develop two complementary general approaches to verify the computability of equilibrium states for nonuniformly expanding computable dynamical systems. The first approach applies to dynamical systems whose topological pressure functions admit effective approximations and whose measure-theoretic entropy functions are upper semicontinuous. As a concrete application, we establish the computability of the equilibrium states for Misiurewicz-Thurston rational maps with H\"older continuous potentials. The second approach exploits prescribed Jacobians of equilibrium states through a local analysis and applies to settings where the measure-theoretic entropy functions may lack upper semicontinuity.</description>

      <title>Jordan and Cartan spectra in higher rank with applications to correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given $d$-tuple $\rho=(\rho_1,\dots,\rho_d):\Gamma \to G$ of faithful Zariski dense convex cocompact representations of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$, we study the correlations of length spectra $\{\ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)}\}_{[\gamma]\in[\Gamma]}$ and correlations of displacement spectra $\{\mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o)\}_{\gamma\in\Gamma}$.
  We prove that for any interior vector $\mathsf v=(v_1,\dots,v_d)$ in the {\it{spectrum cone}}, there exists $\delta_\rho(\mathsf v) &gt; 0$ such that for any $\varepsilon_1, \dots, \varepsilon_d&gt;0$, there exist $c_1,c_2&gt; 0$ such that
  \begin{align*} &amp;\#\{[\gamma]\in [\Gamma]: v_iT \le \ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)} \le v_i T+\varepsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d \} \sim c_1 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf{v})T}}{ T^{{(d+1)}/{2}}};\\ &amp;\#\{\gamma\in \Gamma: v_iT \le \mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o) \le v_i T+\varepsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d \} \sim c_2 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d-1)}/{2}}}.
  \end{align*} We deduce this result as a special case of our main theorem on the distribution of Jordan projections with holonomies and Cartan projections {\it{in tubes}} of an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. We also show that the growth indicator of $\Gamma$ remains the same when we use Jordan projections instead of Cartan projections and tubes instead of cones, except possibly on the boundary of the limit cone.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian integrability of three dimensional vector fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20451v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a three dimensional complex polynomial, or rational, vector field (equivalently, a two-form in three variables) which admits a Liouvillian first integral. We prove that there exists a first integral whose differential is the product of a rational 1-form with a Darboux function, or there exists a Darboux Jacobi multiplier. Moreover, we prove that Liouvillian integrability {in any dimension $n\geq 3$} always implies the existence of a first integral that is obtained by two successive integrations from one-forms with coefficients in a finite algebraic extension of the rational function field.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and stability analysis of a third-order multiclass traffic flow model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic flow modeling spans a wide range of mathematical approaches, from microscopic descriptions of individual vehicle dynamics to macroscopic models based on aggregate quantities. A fundamental challenge in macroscopic modeling lies in the closure relations, particularly in the specification of a traffic hesitation function in second-order models like Aw-Rascle-Zhang. In this work, we propose a third-order hyperbolic traffic model in which the hesitation evolves as a driver-dependent dynamic quantity. Starting from a microscopic formulation, we relax the standard assumption by introducing an evolution law for the hesitation. This extension allows to incorporate hysteresis effects, modeling the fact that drivers respond differently when accelerating or decelerating, even under identical local traffic conditions. Furthermore, various relaxation terms are introduced. These allow us to establish relations to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model and other traffic flow models.</description>

      <title>Degenerate symplectic fixed points and Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for Fano toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds which admit nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion. We prove a new cuplength estimate of symplectic fixed points involved in deformed spectral invariants. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>
