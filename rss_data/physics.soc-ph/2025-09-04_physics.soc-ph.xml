      <title>Optimal interventions in opinion dynamics on large-scale, time-varying, random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two optimization problems in which a planner aims to influence the average transient opinion in the Friedkin-Johnsen dynamics on a network by intervening on the agents' innate opinions. Solving these problems requires full network knowledge, which is often not available because of the cost involved in collecting this information or due to privacy considerations. For this reason, we focus on intervention strategies that are based on statistical instead of exact knowledge of the network. We focus on a time-varying random network model where the network is resampled at each time step and formulate two intervention problems in this setting. We show that these problems can be casted into mixed integer linear programs in the type space, where the type of a node captures its out- and in-degree and other local features of the nodes, and provide a closed form solution for one of the two problems. The integer constraints may be easily removed using probabilistic interventions leading to linear programs. Finally, we show by a numerical analysis that there are cases in which the derived optimal interventions on time-varying networks can lead to close to optimal interventions on fixed networks.</description>

      <title>The Recursive Panopticon Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic "Great Silence" revealed by the Fermi paradox remains a central puzzle in contemporary science. Existing explanations such as the "Big Filter," "Zoo Hypothesis," and "Dark Forest" theory are trapped in isolated frameworks of "hypothesis list paradigm" that resist falsification. This paper proposes the "Recursive Panopticon Hypothesis" arguing that under the uncertainty of recursive higher-order deterrence, cosmic civilizations will universally adopt "silence" as their optimal survival strategy through rational risk avoidance. To test this hypothesis, we innovatively introduce the interdisciplinary research paradigm of "Computational Cosmic Sociology." By constructing a highly parameterized Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulation, we abstract civilizations as rational agents with risk perception, strategy learning, and interactive memory evolving within a simulated cosmic grid. The model's core lies in a utility function based on recursive deterrence theory and a network co-evolution mechanism connecting micro-decisions with macro-social structures. Research findings indicate: "Silence" is an evolutionarily stable strategy; the "Dark Forest" state is merely a special case of system instability under extreme resource scarcity and high-density civilizations; civilizational interactions spontaneously form structured social networks with small-world properties; and a hypothetical "Ultimate Civilization" can effectively maintain order. This study aims to drive paradigm shifts, from listing mutually exclusive hypotheses to a unified, computable theoretical framework, thereby establishing an empirical foundation for cosmological sociology and providing profound insights for SETI strategies.</description>

      <title>Planning for Rhythmized Urban Parks: Temporal Park Classification and Modes of Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem, research strategy, and findings: Urban parks offer residents significant physiological and mental health benefits, improving their quality of life. However, traditional park planning often treats parks as static spatial resources, neglecting their temporal dimension of visitation rhythms. This study proposes a paradigm shift in classifying, programming, and designing parks. Utilizing 1.5 million mobile phone records, we classified 254 urban parks in Tokyo based on their visitation patterns across different times of the day, week, and year. Our results showed that parks are rhythmized by seasonal events and daily activities, exhibiting complex visiting patterns shaped by the combined effects of preference variation and accessibility barriers. We concluded by discussing modes of action for temporal park planning practice. Takeaway for practice: Park planners, designers, and policymakers should seek to incorporate temporality in activity-based park design and programming. This can be fulfilled in four ways by (1) tracing year-round, citywide park activities through data-driven methods, (2) implementing temporary and tactical designs for dynamic park demands, (3) establishing an inclusive park system that helps improve spatiotemporal equity, and (4) encouraging public engagement that cultivates the sense of time and identity.</description>

      <title>$\hbar_E$: an action constant for quantum economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of an economic action constant, denoted ___ E , as a structural analogue to Planck's reduced constant ___ in quantum mechanics. Building on canonical quantization, we define ___ E as the fundamental scale of irreducible uncertainty in macroeconomic dynamics through non-commuting observables ( X, PX ), derive uncertainty relations and a semi-classical limit, and study spectral properties under a double-well economic potential. Numerical simulations show that ___ E governs regime transitions between deterministic, probabilistic, and highly unstable dynamics, with topological changes in phase-space and bifurcations emerging under harmonic modulation of ___ E . We propose a systemic economic interpretation linking the magnitude of ___ E to expectation coordination, institutional stability, and structural volatility, and provide historical analogies (post-war reconstruction, speculative bubbles, systemic crises). We finally outline an empirical strategy to estimate ___ E from macro time series and agent-based simulations, opening a path toward a taxonomy of economic regimes under radical uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Social Costs of Power Outages and Restoration Disparities Across Four U.S. Hurricanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures, integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas, Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and resilience investment.</description>

      <title>Efficient strategy for Parallel Minority Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parallel Minority Game, where a group of agents, each having two choices, try to independently decide on a strategy such that they stay on minority between their own two choices. However, there are multiple such groups of agents, and some of them have common choices. This overlap brings in additional competition among the agents making the variance reduction a complex optimization problem. We study multiple stochastic strategies and find that the most efficient strategy is the one where the agents have just the memory of their last visit to the their alternative choice. The resulting dynamics, even though giving the lowest population variance among the strategies studied here, end up in a frozen state. However, the frozen state does not bring the the variance to its lowest possible value; a situation qualitatively analogous to spin-glass systems.</description>

      <title>Sustainable restoration of intermittent streams: Integrating ecological design and urban resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainable restoration of intermittent streams has become a critical priority in contemporary urban planning, particularly as cities confront the dual challenges of ecological degradation and climate change. In Tehran, decades of rapid urbanization and poor management practices have confined natural streams into rigid concrete channels, eroding their ecological value and disconnecting them from community life. This paper introduces an ecological and sustainability-oriented framework for the restoration of the Darband and Darabad river valleys, highlighting their potential to function as ecological corridors that support biodiversity, thermal regulation, cultural identity, and urban resilience. The study employs a systematic methodology that integrates ecological engineering, landscape design, hydrological modeling, and participatory planning. Findings suggest that restoring these river valleys through sustainable strategies, such as the creation of active green networks, multifunctional public spaces, and resilient hydrological systems, can transform them from degraded drainage corridors into life-giving urban landscapes. Moreover, the research emphasizes the necessity of linking restoration with sustainability goals to ensure long-term ecological balance, social well-being, and climate adaptation. This case study demonstrates that sustainable river restoration, when aligned with ecological design and community engagement, has the potential to reposition intermittent streams as essential infrastructures for sustainable urban development and resilience.</description>

      <title>Network connectivity analysis via shortest paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems of interacting components often can be modeled by a simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ that consists of a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $m$ edges. Such a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A\in\R^{n\times n}$, whose $(ij)$th entry is one if there is an edge pointing from node $i$ to node $j$, and is zero otherwise. The matrix $A$ and its positive integer powers reveal important properties of the graph and allow the construction of the path length matrix $L$ for the graph. The $(ij)$th entry of $L$ is the length of the shortest path from node $i$ to node $j$; if there is no path between these nodes, then the value of the entry is set to $\infty$. We are interested in how well information flows via shortest paths of the graph. This can be studied with the aid of the path length matrix. The path length matrix allows the definition of several measures of communication in the network defined by the graph such as the global $K$-efficiency, which considers shortest paths that are made up of at most $K$ edges for some $K&lt;n$, as well as the number of such shortest paths. Novel notions of connectivity introduced in this paper help us understand the importance of specific edges for the flow of information through the graph. This is of interest when seeking to simplify a network by removing selected edges or trying to assess the sensitivity of the flow of information to changes due to exterior causes such as a traffic stoppage on a road network.</description>

      <title>The Early Career Workshop of GR-Amaldi 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational physics and astronomy have developed rapidly over the last decade, driven by new observations and theoretical breakthroughs. As new as the science and technology of this field are, its greatest asset may be the body of early-career researchers actively engaged in driving it forward. With the aim of bringing together this community of enthusiastic scientists from a broad array of disciplines, the organisers of the GR-Amaldi meeting joined with the Gravitational-Wave Early Career Scientists organisation to create a three-day event: the Early Career Workshop. The Workshop aimed to provide a broad overview of the field's diverse scientific possibilities and introduce key theoretical foundations underpinning its science. To complement developing technical skills, the Workshop also sought to provide participants with transferable skills to aid them in their future careers. The Workshop emphasized networking and community building, offering participants opportunities to engage with peers and mentors. It encouraged interdisciplinary exchanges and cross-institutional collaboration, fostering connections across different research efforts. Collectively, these initiatives aimed to equip participants with a comprehensive understanding of the field's research and to build a more cohesive, collaborative community of early-career researchers. We summarise key points and conclusion from the carious activities carried out as part of the Workshop.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Infection Spread and Hotspot Growth in Bi-Pathogen Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemics with multiple pathogens requires not only new theoretical models but also careful analysis of their practical consequences. Building on the Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion framework (MBRD) introduced in our companion paper, we investigate how the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI) behave under different epidemiological and network conditions. Through numerical experiments, we study the effects of pathogen virulence, diffusion rates, and cross-diffusion on epidemic hotspot formation and long-term prevalence. Our results highlight the role of multiplex structure in amplifying or suppressing co-circulating infections, and provide quantitative insight into conditions that drive persistent epidemic patterns. Beyond epidemiology, these findings have broader implications for multiplex contagion processes such as information diffusion and malware propagation.</description>

      <title>Eigendecompositions of temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks, defined as sequences of time-aggregated adjacency matrices, sample latent graph dynamics and trace trajectories in graph space. By interpreting each adjacency matrix as a different time snapshot of a scalar field, fluid-mechanics theories can be applied to construct two distinct eigendecompositions of temporal networks. The first builds on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of flowfields and decomposes the evolution of a network in terms of a basis of orthogonal network eigenmodes which are ordered in terms of their relative importance, hence enabling compression of temporal networks as well as their reconstruction from low-dimensional embeddings. The second proposes a numerical approximation of the Koopman operator, a linear operator acting on a suitable observable of the graph space which provides the best linear approximation of the latent graph dynamics. Its eigendecomposition provides a data-driven spectral description of the temporal network dynamics, in terms of dynamic modes which grow, decay or oscillate over time. Both eigendecompositions are illustrated and validated in a suite of synthetic generative models of temporal networks with varying complexity.</description>

      <title>Network-driven discovery of repurposable drugs targeting hallmarks of aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the thousands of genes implicated in age-related phenotypes, effective interventions for aging remain elusive, a lack of advance rooted in the multifactorial nature of longevity and the functional interconnectedness of the molecular components implicated in aging. Here, we introduce a network medicine framework that integrates 2,358 longevity-associated genes onto the human interactome to identify existing drugs that can modulate aging processes. We find that genes associated with each hallmark of aging form a connected subgraph, or hallmark module, a discovery enabling us to measure the proximity of 6,442 clinically approved or experimental compounds to each hallmark. We then introduce a transcription-based metric, $pAGE$, which evaluates whether the drug-induced expression shifts reinforce or counteract known age-related expression changes. By integrating network proximity and $pAGE$, we identify multiple drug repurposing candidate that not only target specific hallmarks but act to reverse their aging-associated transcriptional changes. Our findings are interpretable, revealing for each drug the molecular mechanisms through which it modulates the hallmark, offering an experimentally falsifiable framework to leverage genomic discoveries to accelerate drug repurposing for longevity.</description>

      <title>Q-Learning-Driven Adaptive Rewiring for Cooperative Control in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems represents a fundamental statistical physics problem where microscopic learning rules drive macroscopic collective behavior transitions. We propose a Q-learning-based variant of adaptive rewiring that builds on mechanisms studied in the literature. This method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation, creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns, we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels, revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster formation with power-law size distributions. Our results establish a new paradigm for understanding intelligence-driven cooperation pattern formation in complex adaptive systems, revealing how machine learning serves as an alternative driving force for spontaneous organization in multi-agent networks.</description>

      <title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20015v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. We provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression and define testable conditions for the emergence of Zipf's law in compressing systems.</description>
