      <title>A Jammed Parisi Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems are ubiquitous in fields ranging from the physics of solids to artificial intelligence. In many cases, such systems undergo a transition when the ratio of constraints to variables reaches some value $\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$. Above this critical value, it is exponentially unlikely that all constraints can be mutually satisfied. We calculate the probability that constraints can all be satisfied, $P(\textrm{SAT})$, for the spherical perceptron. Traditional replica methods, such as the Parisi ansatz, fall short. We find a new ansatz, the jammed Parisi ansatz, that correctly describes the behavior of the system in this regime. With the jammed Parisi ansatz, we calculate $P(\textrm{SAT})$ for the first time and match previous computations of thresholds. We anticipate that the techniques developed here will be applicable to general constraint satisfaction problems and the identification of hidden structures in data sets.</description>

      <title>On the thermodynamic limit of bipartite spin networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the thermodynamic limit in a general bipartite spin network with pairwise interactions. This is done by integrating one of the the spin groups, to transform the bipartite problem into a single group problem with a non-linear Hamiltonian. The transformed model is also relevant due to similarity with the LCVAE architecture.</description>

      <title>Exceptions to the Ratchet Principle in active and passive stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "ratchet principle" asserts that non-equilibrium systems which violate parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents. As recently shown, there are exceptions to this principle, due to the existence of hidden time-reversal symmetry or bulk momentum conservation. For underdamped and overdamped Brownian dynamics, we show how thermal fluctuations cannot power the momentum sources required to sustain steady ratchet currents, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to an inhomogeneous temperature field. While Active Brownian and Run-and-Tumble particles display interaction-induced ratchet currents in asymmetric activity landscapes, we show that this is not the case for Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles: not all inhomogeneous active fluctuations lead to net momentum sources. For each of the systems considered in this article, we numerically test for the emergence of interaction-induced ratchet currents. We then characterize time-reversal (as)symmetry in position space using a combination of path-integral and operator methods. When the existence of effective momentum conservation is ruled out, we develop perturbation theories to characterize the onset of interaction-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</description>

      <title>A Bond weighted tensor renormalization group study of the q-state ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling relation for growth phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Family-Vicsek relation is a seminal universal relation obtained for the global roughness at the interface of two media in the growth process. In this work, we revisit the scaling analysis and, through both analytical and computational means, show that the Family-Vicsek relation can be generalized to a new scaling independent of the size, substrate dimension $d$, and scaling exponents. We use properties of lattice growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Villain-Lai-Das Sarma universality classes for $1 \leq d \leq 3$ to support our claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel exclusion process with a simple local kinetic constraint that leads to a remarkable transition between a homogeneous phase with short-range correlations and a clustered phase with long-range correlations and spontaneous breaking of translation invariance. The metastable dynamics of particle clusters lead to a coarsening cascade and glassy dynamics, as well as an intriguing faster-is-slower effect where an increasing asymmetry in the flow direction leads to a decrease of the stationary current.</description>

      <title>Random motility regulation drives the fragmentation of microbial ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-organization of microbial ecosystems involves a large variety of mechanisms, ranging from biochemical signaling to population dynamics. Among these, the role of motility regulation has been little studied, despite the importance of active migration processes. Here we show how weak, random motility regulation generically induces the fragmentation of bacterial ecosystems comprising a large number of coexisting strains. To do so, we simulate microscopic models of run-and-tumble bacteria whose self-propulsion speeds are regulated by the local density of each strain. Our simulations reveal that, as the heterogeneity of the interaction network increases, the ecosystem undergoes a phase transition leading to the emergence of distinct communities. To account for these results and assess their robustness, we use random-matrix theory to analyze the hydrodynamic description of the bacterial ecosystem, obtaining a quantitative agreement with our microscopic simulations. Our results are shown to hold for a variety of motility-regulation mechanisms and should be relevant to the study of community formation by motile organisms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic optimization of finite-time feedback protocols for Markov jump systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent advances in finite-time thermodynamics, optimization of entropy production required for finite-time information processing is an important issue. In this work, we consider finite-time feedback processes in classical discrete systems described by Markov jump processes, and derive achievable bounds on entropy production for feedback processes controlled by Maxwell's demons. The key ingredients of our approach is optimal transport theory and an achievable Fano's inequality, by which we optimize the Wasserstein distance over final distributions under fixed consumed information. Our study reveals the minimum entropy production for consuming a certain amount of information, and moreover, the optimal feedback protocol to achieve it. These results are expected to lead to design principles for information processing in various stochastic systems with discrete states.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Stochastic Processes with Division, Death, and Diffusion: Spatial Correlations, Marginal Entropy Production, and Macroscopic Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</description>

      <title>Assessment of spectral phases of non-Hermitian quantum systems through complex and singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic behavior or lack thereof in non-Hermitian systems is often diagnosed via spectral analysis of associated complex eigenvalues. Very recently, singular values of the associated non-Hermitian systems have been proposed as an effective measure to study dissipative quantum chaos. Motivated by the rich properties of non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices and its promise as a platform to study localized and delocalized phases in non-Hermitian systems, we make an in-depth study to assess different spectral phases of these matrices through the lens of both complex eigenvalues and singular values. Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder. Our work indicates that systems, where disorder is present both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian segments of a Hamiltonian, are sensitive to the specific diagnostic tool that needs to be employed to study quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking semi-empirical quantum chemical methods on liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical field theories for biaxial liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase field crystal (PFC) models constitute central tools for a microscopic understanding of the dynamics of complex systems in soft matter physics. They have found widespread application in the modeling of the uniaxial orientational ordering of liquid crystals. However, only very limited progress has been made in applying them to the more complex cases of biaxial phases and biaxial particles. Here, we discuss the microscopic derivation of PFC models for biaxial liquid crystals. We illustrate it by presenting two models, one involving four scalar orientational order parameters relevant for the dynamics of biaxial particles, and one involving two scalar order parameters and a director field to describe biaxial phases in a three-dimensional uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. These models allow for an efficient simulation of spatially inhomogeneous biaxial orientational ordering dynamics. We also combine a microscopic and macroscopic approach to extract model coefficients for a full biaxial model from the microscopic derivation for a simple special case. This universal method also enables to perform derivations for other low-symmetry particles where, due to the complexity of the general case, this has not been previously attempted.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Design of Floppy Modes and Frustrated Loops in Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. Here, we introduce a combinatorial approach that allows to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize the designability of floppy chains and frustrated loops to demonstrate matrix-vector multiplication in materia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</description>

      <title>Entropic bottlenecks to nematic ordering in an $RP^{2}$ apolar spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lebwohl-Lasher model of liquid crystals with (d = 2, n = 3) describes interacting apolar spins, with an $RP^{2}$ order-parameter topology. Simulations with a modified Wang-Landau Monte Carlo protocol, that includes a density of states (DoS) factor, had previously found a zero latent-heat transition at $T=T_{n}$ to a novel nematic order, coexisting with unbound defects whose binding is completed only on cooling. We find through this entropically augmented MC protocol, that there is a deep dip in the DoS at an energy preceding global ordering, reflecting 'sparse' intermediate configurations, or entropy barriers. The narrow entropic bottleneck induces a cusp in the initially rising nematic correlation length, at a micro-canonical 'precursor' temperature $T=T_{p}$. A finite-scale cooperativity of defects and nematic clusters penetrates the bottleneck at $T_{p}$ to enable a third-order phase transition at a lower $T_{n}$: a rare pathway, overlooked by energy-only acceptance protocols.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions II: Covariance Matrix Dynamics for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field and Effects of Dielectric on Atom-Field Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of multi-partite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I~\cite{HH24} we consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$ system-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schr\"odinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.</description>

      <title>High-entropy Advantage in Neural Networks' Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics ignites a worldwide discussion on the origins of neural networks and their foundational links to physics, modern machine learning research predominantly focuses on computational and algorithmic advancements, overlooking a picture of physics. Here we introduce the concept of entropy into neural networks by reconceptualizing them as hypothetical physical systems where each parameter is a non-interacting 'particle' within a one-dimensional space. By employing a Wang-Landau algorithms, we construct the neural networks' (with up to 1 million parameters) entropy landscapes as functions of training loss and test accuracy (or loss) across four distinct machine learning tasks, including arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of \textit{entropy advantage}, where the high-entropy states generally outperform the states reached via classical training optimizer like stochastic gradient descent. We also find this advantage is more pronounced in narrower networks, indicating a need of different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use mean-field theory to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</description>

Abstract: Analytical relations for the glass transition temperature, $T_g$, and the crystal melting temperature, $T_m$, are developed on the basis of nonaffine lattice dynamics. The proposed relations explain: (i) the seemingly universal factor of $\approx 2/3$ difference between glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the corresponding crystal, and (ii) the recent empirical discovery that both $T_g$ and $T_m$ are proportional to the liquid fragility $m$ divided by the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ of the solid.</description>

Abstract: The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium. However, this explanation lacks a rigorous description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resetting for Informed Search Strategies and the Design of Non-equilibrium Steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting, the procedure of stopping and re-initializing random processes, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating processes ranging from queuing systems to molecular simulations. However, its usefulness is severely limited by assuming that the resetting protocol is completely decoupled from the state and age of the process that is being reset. We present a general formulation for state- and time-dependent resetting of stochastic processes, which we call adaptive resetting. This allows us to predict, using a single set of trajectories without resetting and via a simple reweighing procedure, all key observables of processes with adaptive resetting. These include the first-passage time distribution, the propagator, and the steady-state. Our formulation enables efficient exploration of informed search strategies and facilitates the prediction and design of complex non-equilibrium steady states, eliminating the need for extensive brute-force sampling across different resetting protocols. Finally, we develop a general machine learning framework to optimize the adaptive resetting protocol for an arbitrary task beyond the current state of the art. We use it to discover efficient protocols for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Correlations under Temperature Gradients: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Simple Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fluids under temperature gradients, long-range correlations (LRCs) emerge generically, leading to enhanced density fluctuations. This phenomenon, characterized by the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the static structure factor (where $\boldsymbol{q}$ is the wavenumber), has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, they remain unexplored in Hamiltonian particle systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This Letter reports the first MD study to provide unambiguous observations of the LRCs. We demonstrate this by three distinct approaches: (1) measuring the static structure factor and directly observing the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence characterizing the LRCs; (2) detecting the corresponding $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the dynamic structure factor; (3) establishing a quantitative agreement between MD results and predictions from fluctuating hydrodynamics, the phenomenological theory that predicts the LRCs. Our findings demonstrate that MD simulations offer a powerful complementary tool to theoretical and experimental investigations of LRCs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Level-Crossing Induced by Anisotropy in Spin-1 Heisenberg Dimers: Applications to Quantum Stirling Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</description>

      <title>Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized space-time duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.</description>

Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Linear response in a charged gas in curved spacetime and covariant heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>On the detectability of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper I present the state of the art concerning the theoretical detectability (and the open challenges for the experimental detectability) of a special class of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions. The particles under considerations, obeying a parastatistics, are mutually exchanged via the permutation group and can exist in any space dimension (the anyons, which transform under the more general braid group, cannot exist in more than two space dimensions).</description>

      <title>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02231v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Violation of Parity and Flavor Symmetries in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Constraints from anti-unitary symmetries on phase diagrams of sign problem-free models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.</description>
