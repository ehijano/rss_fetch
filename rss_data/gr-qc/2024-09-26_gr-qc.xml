      <title>Exploring Phase Space Trajectories in $\Lambda$CDM Cosmology with f(G) Gravity Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the cosmic solutions, particularly the well-known $\Lambda$CDM model, are investigated in the framework of the Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the gravitational action incorporates the Gauss-Bonnet invariant function. We utilize a specialized formulation of the deceleration parameter in terms of the Hubble parameter $H$, given by $q = -1 - \frac{\dot{H}}{H^2}$, to solve the field equations. To identify the appropriate model parameters, we align them to the most recent observational datasets, which include 31 data points from the Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+, and BAO datasets. The physical characteristics of the cosmographic parameters, such as pressure and energy density, that correlate to the limited values of the model parameters, are examined. The evolution of the deceleration parameter suggests a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase of the universe. Additionally, we examine the stability of the assumed model and provide an explanation for late-time acceleration using the energy conditions. The behavior of the equation of state parameter has been analyzed through dynamical variables by constraining various parameters in light of the recent observational data. This study has resulted in a quintessence-like evolution.</description>

      <title>The black hole shadow of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the black hole shadow of an exact black hole solution of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) theory. We discuss some of its optical characteristics after generalizing it to the rotational case, including null geodesics and black hole shadow. From these we can compare the impact of different theories on the most deeply understood characteristics of the black hole and get a new way to test the accuracy of the modified gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Eisenhart Lift for Scalar Fields in the FLRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eisenhart lift of Riemannian type describes the motion of a particle as a geodesic in a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold with one additional coordinate. It has recently been generalized to a scalar field system by introducing one additional vector field. We apply this approach to a scalar field system in the FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker) universe and classify the symmetries of the system. In particular, we find nontrivial (conformal) Killing vector field and Killing tensor fields for a scalar field potential consisting of the square of a combination of exponential functions with specific index $e^{\pm\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}\phi}$. Moreover, we find nontrivial conformal Killing vector fields for a potential which is written as an exponentiation of a combination of exponential potentials with general index. Complete solutions to the equations of motion are given. We also classify the symmetries of multiple scalar field system.</description>

      <title>For a flat Universe, $C_P/C_V=-q$! $-$ another coincidence in Cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with gravitational thermodynamics on the dynamical apparent horizon of an FLRW universe with dissipation. The dissipation is assumed to arise due to adiabatic gravitational particle creation. For the thermodynamic study, we consider the Bekenstein-Hawking formalism and also assume a nonzero curvature $\kappa$ for a general study. In particular, we study the unified first law, the generalized second law, and thermodynamic stability in our model. The specific heat capacities are taken into account for the study of thermodynamic stability. Our study reveals a fascinating result! The ratio of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure and that at constant volume in a flat FLRW universe with dissipation is nothing but the negative of the deceleration parameter. In classical thermodynamics, this ratio is known as the isentropic expansion factor or (for ideal gases) the adiabatic index. A more interesting fact that has come to light is that this relation holds true in the $\Lambda$CDM model also! So, this is actually a generic result and is independent of the cosmological model used. We discuss the implications of this result on the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we determine the constraints on the effective equation of state which guarantees thermodynamic stability in our model.</description>

      <title>A generalized solution for anisotropic compact star model in F(Q) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an anisotropic compact star's physical properties and stability in F(Q) gravity. The study focuses on the significance of F(Q) gravity on the structure and stability of compact star, considering non-perfect fluid. Buchdahl ansatz along with transformation used to solve the Einstein field equations. We investigate the physical parameters of the 4U1820-30 compact star using a static spherical metric in the interior region and a Schwarzschild (anti) de-sitter metric in the exterior region. We investigate the behaviour of energy density(rho), radial pressure(pr), tangential pressure(pt), anisotropy, metric potentials, energy state parameters, and energy requirements in the interior of the proposed stellar object. The equilibrium state of this star is analysed using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff(TOV) equation and their stability is determined using the regularity condition, causality condition, the adiabatic index(Gamma) method, and Herrera cracking method.</description>

      <title>The Weyl conformal tensor in a 4-index gravitational field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl conformal tensor is the traceless component of the Riemann tensor and therefore, as is known, the information it contains does not appear explicitly in Einstein's gravitation equation. Following a rigorous mathematical treatment based on the variational principle, we'll suggest that there exists a 4-index gravitational field equation containing the Weyl tensor linearly closely related to a tidal gravitational field tensor whose components will be calculated. We'll demonstrate, among other things, that the cosmological constant appears as a natural solution of the four-index theory in the form of an integration constant which therefore does not need to be introduced ad hoc into a Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Inflation does not create entanglement in local observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using modern tools of relativistic quantum information, we compare entanglement of a free, massive scalar field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the cosmological patch of de Sitter spacetime with that in Minkowski spacetime. There is less entanglement between spatially localized field modes in de Sitter, despite the fact that there is more entanglement stored in the field on large scales. This shows that inflation does not produce entanglement between local observables.</description>

      <title>Non-Extensive Entropy and Power-Law Inflation: Implications for Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the interaction between non-extensive entropic FLRW cosmology and the power-law inflationary model, with a focus on the overlap between the scalar spectral index `$n_s$' and the tensor-to-scalar ratio `$r$'. Based on a conjecture that non-extensive entropy alters the energy-momentum content of the cosmic fluid, the analysis examines how these overlaps shift with different model parameters and compares the findings to those from Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropic cosmology. The study highlights the impact of Tsallis, R\'{e}nyi, and Sharma-Mittal entropies, uncovering a significant correlation between `$n_s$' and `$r$' that suggests a deeper connection in power-law inflationary dynamics. The results demonstrate that non-extensive entropies not only enable viable inflation with a graceful exit but also address limitations inherent in the standard BH entropic framework, emphasizing the importance of precise parameter estimation. Specifically, Tsallis entropy allows for power-law inflation with $n = 1$ to $n = 2$ in alignment with Planck 2018 data. Moreover, the $\alpha$ parameter in R\'{e}nyi and Sharma-Mittal entropy models must be extremely small ($\alpha \leq 10^{-8}$ in Planck mass units) to achieve successful power-law inflation with an e-folding number around 55-65, suggesting a unified thermodynamic perspective in cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Circumventing the Ricci-inverse no-go theorem with complexifiable singularities: a novel dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ricci-inverse gravity is a new type of fourth-order gravity theory based on the anti-curvature tensor, that is, the inverse of the Ricci tensor. In this context, we introduce a novel method to circumvent the binding effects of a well-known no-go theorem for cosmic trajectories that cannot smoothly join a decelerated cosmic age with the current accelerated expansion of the universe. We therefore design a new class of Ricci-inverse theories whose cosmologies, without falling into no-go singularities, achieve the observed expansion as a stable attractor solution. This new perspective retrains Ricci-inverse cosmologies as viable dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Analytic expressions for quasinormal modes of the general parametrized spherically symmetric black holes and the Hod's proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an expansion in terms of the inverse multipole number and the WKB approach, we derive an analytic expression for generic parametrized spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes described by the Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime, in the regime when deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry are relatively small, i.e., when the coefficients of the parametrization are small. As an application of this analytic formula, we demonstrate that such generic black holes satisfy Hod's proposal, which constrains the damping rate of the least damped mode in relation to the Hawking temperature.</description>

      <title>Sgr A* Shadow Study with KTN Space Time and Investigation of NUT Charge Existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I investigate the existence of the NUT charge through the KTN spacetime using shadow observations of Sgr A*. I report that the range of my constraint for the NUT charge is between $-$0.5 and 0.5 for Schwarzschild-like and very slowly rotating KTN black holes. This range extends to 1.5 for spins up to $-$2 and $-$1.5 for spins up to 2 based on Keck observations for both 40$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$ viewing angles. For VLTI observations, Schwarzschild-like and very slowly rotating KTN black holes are excluded for a 40$^\circ$ viewing angle, and the NUT charge is constrained to a very narrow range for a 10$^\circ$ viewing angle. I report that the possibility of having KTN naked singularities in Sgr A* is small, considering the uncertainties in the shadow size.</description>

      <title>How to describe the Sweet-Parker model in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a hot topic nowadays that magnetic reconnection, as a physical process to release magnetic energy effectively, occurs in numerous complicated astrophysical systems. Since the magnetic reconnection is thought to occur frequently in the accretion flow around compact objects which induce strong gravitational field, it is now regarded to be a practical mechanism to extract energy from rotation black holes, which motivates people to consider how to describe the process of magnetic reconnection in a generally relativistic way. In this work, I try to explore the description of Sweet-Parker model, one of the most famous theoretical models of magnetic reconnection, in general relativity. I begin with revisiting the Sweet-Parker model in special relativity and reorganize the calculations in seven steps, whose generally relativistic forms are discussed. I propose in this work, from the general discussions and consequences of specific examples, that no property in Sweet-Parker model would be modified by spacetime curvature, which is opposite to the conclusions in previous work. However, on the contrary, observation in different rest frames may bring modifications. If the magnetic reconnection occurs not in the rest frame of observer, the observer would find out that the detected relation between the reconnection rate and Lundquist number or that between outflow speed and Alfven velocity are not the same as the detected relations if the magnetic reconnection occurs just in the rest frame of observer.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Radial Acceleration Relation of Dwarf Galaxies with Emergent Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether the radial acceleration relation (RAR) of dwarf galaxies can be explained by Verlinde's emergent gravity. This is the extension of arXiv:2206.11685v3, which examines the RAR of typical spiral galaxies, to less massive systems. To do this, we compile the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of 30 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group from the literature. We then calculate the expected gravitational acceleration from the stellar component in the framework of the emergent gravity, and compare it with that from observations. The calculated acceleration with the emergent gravity under the assumption of a quasi-de Sitter universe agrees with the observed one within the uncertainty. Our results suggest that the emergent gravity can explain the kinematics of galaxies without introducing dark matter, even for less massive galaxies where dark matter is expected to dominate. This sharply contrasts with MOND, where a new interpolating function has to be introduced for dwarf galaxies to explain their kinematics without dark matter.</description>

      <title>Black holes at a crossroads: late-stage evaporation in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In General Relativity black hole evaporation leads to sudden bursts of energy and loss of information. It can be argued that these phenomena happen in the final stages of evaporation, where the semiclassical approximation needs to be refined with quantum corrections also for the gravitational interaction. A natural way to describe gravity at high energies is to add quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action, i.e. quadratic gravity. At the cosmological level it is known that its classical solutions can give rise to a model of inflation that matches observations strikingly well, while in an astrophysical context it allows for the possibility of non-Schwarzschild black holes at small masses. These solutions have very peculiar properties, due to the presence of a massive spin-2 particle corresponding to a ghost at the quantum level. The branch of non-Schwarzschild solutions crosses the one of Schwarzschild ones at a specific mass which could be between the one of an asteroid and the Planck mass, depending on the value of a slightly constrained free parameter. By analyzing their dynamical stability and thermodynamical properties, we investigate what could happen to a black hole that has evaporated to this crossing point. While this investigation might not solve the problem of the endpoint of evaporation, it can shed light on the directions it might take during its last moments.</description>

      <title>A numerical-relativity surrogate model for hyperbolic encounters of black holes: challenges in parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a surrogate numerical-relativity model for close hyperbolic black-hole encounters with equal masses and spins aligned with the orbital momentum. Our model, generated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$, spans impact parameters $b/M\in [11, 15]$ and spin components $\chi_{i} \in [-0.5,0.5]$, modeling the $(\ell,m)=(2,0)$, $(2, \pm 2)$, $(3,\pm 2)$ and $(4,\pm 4)$ emission multipoles. The model is faithful to numerical relativity simulations, yielding mismatches lower than $10^{-3}$. We test the ability of our model to recover the parameters of numerically simulated signals. We find that, despite the high accuracy of the model, parameter inference struggles to correctly capture the parameters of the source even for SNRs as large as 50 due to the strong degeneracies present in the parameter space. This indicates that correctly identifying these systems will require of extremely large signal loudness, only typical of third generation detectors. Nevertheless, we also find that, if one attempts to infer certain combinations of such degenerated parameters, there might be a chance to prove the existence of this type of events, even with the current ground-based detectors, as long as these combinations make sense astrophysically and cosmologically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theory descriptions of surface waves on flowing fluids have tended to assume that the flow is irrotational, but this assumption is often impractical due to boundary layer friction and flow recirculation. Here we develop an effective field theory of surface waves in an incompressible, inviscid flow that includes vorticity due to shear. Our model consists of a two-layer flow: an upper layer with no vorticity and a lower layer with constant vorticity. We consider linear, long-wavelength perturbations on top of such a flow, and find that these can be described by two coupled scalar fields admitting three elementary excitations, one more than the usual two found in irrotational flows. We compute the scattering coefficients pertaining to modes falling into an analogue black hole. Our approach provides a more realistic framework for simulating gravitational wave phenomena possibly with an internal structure mimicking quantum gravity effects in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>On Universality of Instability in the Fundamental Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on a criterion for the emergence of instability in the fundamental mode recently observed by Cheung {\it et al.}, as a universal phenomenon in the context of black hole perturbations. Such instability is characterized by an exponential spiral, deviating from the quasinormal frequencies due to an insignificant perturbation moving away from the compact object. Our analysis begins with a specific case involving a truncated P\"oschl-Teller potential for which we derive an explicit form of the criterion. Notably, it is shown analytically, contrary to other cases studied in the literature, that the fundamental mode is stable. These derivations are then generalized to a broader context, embracing two underlying mathematical formalisms. Specifically, the spiral is attributed to either the poles in the black hole's reflection amplitude or the zeros in the transmission amplitude. Additionally, we revisit and then generalize a toy model in which perturbations to the effective potential are disjointed, demonstrating that such a configuration invariably leads to instability in the fundamental mode, and the resulting outward spiral always occurs in the counter-clockwise direction. The derived criterion is not restricted to the fundamental mode but is generally relevant for the first few low-lying modes. We demonstrate numerically that the sprial's period and the frequency's relative deviation agree well with our analytical estimations.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics around a black hole with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with weakly nonminimally coupled monopole charge. We analytically and numerically investigate light ray propagation around such a black hole by employing the common Lagrangian formalism. Our analysis encompasses both radial and angular geodesics, for which we present analytical solutions in terms of incomplete Lauricella hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we explore the impact of the coupling constant on geodesic motion. Based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, we constrain the black hole parameters, resulting in a coupling constant range of $-0.5 M^2\lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5 M^2$. Throughout our analysis, we simulate all possible trajectories and, where necessary, perform numerical inversion of the included integrals.</description>

      <title>Developments of initial data on big bang singularities for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Ringstr\"om proposed a geometric notion of initial data on big bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's equations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations in 4 spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringstr\"om, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringstr\"om's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.
  In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a special spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting.</description>

      <title>Effective Kerr geometry from loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an effective Kerr metric from an effective Schwarzschild metric inspired by loop quantum gravity through the Newman-Janis algorithm. The resulting spacetime is free from the classical ring singularity and does not allow the existence of closed time-like curves, due to a lower radial bound in its domain inherited by the spherically symmetric seed metric. We give a possible interpretation to this lower bound by casting the metric in generalized Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinates. We analyze the horizon structure and the ergoregion pointing out the similarities and the differences with the classical Kerr spacetime. The study of the trajectory of the zero angular momentum observer allows to show two novel effects due purely to quantum gravity related to the frame dragging and the repulsive behaviour in the deep quantum region. We derive an effective separation Carter constant and the geodesic equations. Finally, we specialize the geodesic analysis to equatorial circular trajectories obtaining a modified third Kepler law and the equation defining the photon sphere.</description>

      <title>Novel understanding of Cosmological Phenomena using Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer unique probes of diverse cosmological phenomena due to their characteristic properties, including short duration timescale and high dispersion measure. This study investigates two distinct theoretical frameworks: the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) mechanism for ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) and fraction of dark matter in primordial mass black holes. We explore the hypothesis that ultra-high-frequency GWs could be responsible for FRB generation. Consequently, the detection of continuous GWs signal from the vicinity of an FRB by current or future detectors would disfavour merger-based FRB formation models and lend significant credence to the GZ theory, which postulates the existence of high-frequency GWs. Moreover, we examine the effects of modified gravity on the gravitational lensing of FRBs and thereby put constraints on the fraction of primordial mass black holes made up of dark matter. Our analysis suggests that modified gravity introduces a screening effect on lensing, analogous to the scattering effect by plasma on light rays. We further discuss the expected detection rates of FRBs as well as lensed FRBs with upcoming radio telescopes, primarily HIRAX.</description>

      <title>The multimode nature of spacetime entanglement in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the presence of multimode entanglement in the vacuum state of a free, massless scalar quantum field in four-dimensional flat spacetime between two sets of field modes, each contained within a spacetime region that is causally disconnected from the other. This is true despite the fact that entanglement between pairs of individual field modes is sparse and appears only when the two individual modes are carefully selected. Our results reveal that, while entanglement between individual modes is limited, bipartite multimode entanglement in quantum field theory is ubiquitous. We further argue that such multimode entanglement is operationally extractable, and it forms the basis of the entanglement commonly discussed in entanglement harvesting protocols.</description>

      <title>Simulating black hole quantum dynamics on an optical lattice using the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a low energy model for simulating an analog black hole on an optical lattice using ultracold atoms. Assuming the validity of the holographic principle, we employ the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which describes a system of randomly infinite range interacting fermions, also conjectured to be an exactly solvable UV-complete model for an extremal black hole in a higher dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) dilaton gravity. At low energies, the SYK model exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry and is dual to the extremal black hole solution in near AdS2 spacetime. Furthermore, we show how the SYK maximally chaotic behaviour at large N limit, found to be dual to a gauge theory in higher dimensions, can also be employed as a non-trivial investigation tool for the holographic principle. The proposed setup is a theoretical platform to realize the SYK model with relevant exotic effects and behaviour at low energies as a highly non-trivial example of the AdS/CFT duality and a framework for studying black holes.</description>

      <title>Restoring Causality in Higher Curvature Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating higher curvature terms into gravity theories modifies the classical field equations, potentially leading to theoretical issues like Shapiro time advancements that violate the Camanho, Edelstein, Maldacena, and Zhiboedov (CEMZ) causality criterion. We explore this criterion within the context of Generalised Quadratic Gravity (GQG), a higher curvature theory with a distinct graviton three-point coupling from General Relativity (GR). By constructing an exact shock wave solution of GQG and calculating the Shapiro time shift for a massless probe graviton, we demonstrate that it can remain strictly positive within a classically allowed parameter space of couplings, ensuring the theory's adherence to the CEMZ criterion. This finding indicates that GQG can offer a causal extension beyond GR, paving the way for further exploration into the consistency of classical higher curvature gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We show that a universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in five-dimensional spacetime ($5D$ EGB), we derive the hydrostatic equilibrium equations and solve them numerically to obtain neutron stars for both isotropic and anisotropic distribution of matter. The mass-radius relations are obtained for SLy equation of state, which describes both the solid crust and the liquid core of neutron stars, and for a wide range of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha$. More specifically, we find that the contribution of the Gauss-Bonnet term leads to substantial deviations from Einstein gravity. We also discuss that after a certain value of $\alpha$, the theory admits higher maximum masses compared with general relativity, however, the causality condition is violated in the high-mass region. Finally, our results are compared with the recent observations data on mass-radius diagram.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Effective-one-body theory for spinless binaries based on post-Minkowskian approximation I: Hamiltonian and decoupled equation for $\psi^B_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09838v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To build a self-consistent effective-one-body (EOB) theory, in which the Hamiltonian, radiation-reaction force and waveform for the "plus" and "cross" modes of the gravitational wave should be based on the same effective background spacetime, the key step is to look for the decoupled equation for $\psi^B_{4}=\ddot{h}_{+}-i\ddot{h}_{\times}$, which seems a very difficult task because there are non-vanishing tetrad components of the tracefree Ricci tensor for such spacetime. Fortunately, based on an effective spacetime obtained in this paper by using the post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation, we find the decoupled equation for $\psi^B_{4}$ by dividing the perturbation part of the metric into the odd and even parities. With the effective metric and decoupled equation at hand, we set up a frame of self-consistent EOB model for spinless binaries.</description>

      <title>Improved binary black hole searches through better discrimination against noise transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-duration noise transients in LIGO and Virgo detectors significantly affect the search sensitivity of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, especially in the high mass region. In a previous work by the authors \cite{Joshi_2021}, a $\chi^2$ statistic was proposed to distinguish them, when modeled as sine-Gaussians, from non-spinning CBCs. The present work is an extension where we demonstrate the better noise-discrimination of an improved $\chi^2$ statistic -- called the optimized sine-Gaussian $\chi^2$ -- in real LIGO data. The extension includes accounting for the initial phase of the noise transients and use of a well-informed choice of sine-Gaussian basis vectors selected to discern how CBC signals and some of the most worrisome noise-transients project differently on them~\cite{sunil_2022}. To demonstrate this improvement, we use data with blip glitches from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston detectors. Blips are a type of short-duration non-Gaussian noise disturbance known to adversely affect high-mass CBC searches. For CBCs, spin-aligned binary black hole signals were simulated using the \textsc{IMRPhenomPv2} waveform and injected into real LIGO data from the same run. We show that in comparison to the sine-Gaussian $\chi^2$, the optimized sine-Gaussian $\chi^2$ improves the overall true positive rate by around 6\% in a lower-mass bin ($m_1,m_2 \in [20,40]M_{\odot}$) and by more than 3\% in a higher-mass bin ($m_1,m_2 \in [60,80]M_{\odot}$). On the other hand, we see a larger improvement -- of more than 20\% -- in both mass bins in comparison to the traditional $\chi^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the research on the self-consistent effective-one-body theory of a real spinless two-body system based on the post-Minkowskian approximation (Science China, 65, 100411, (2022)) to the case of a binary system for the spinning black holes. An effective rotating metric and an improved Hamiltonian for the spinning black hole binaries were constructed. The decoupled equation for the null tetrad component of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor $\psi^B_{4}$ in the effective rotating spacetime is found with the help of the gauge transform characteristics of the Weyl tensors. The decoupled equation is then separated between radial and angular variables in the slowly rotating background spacetime, and a formal solution of $\psi^B_{4}$ is obtained. On this basis, the formal expressions of the radiation reaction force and the waveform for the ``plus'' and ``cross'' modes of the gravitational wave are presented. These results, obtained in the same effective spacetime, constitute a self-consistent effective-one-body theory for the spinning black hole binaries based on the post-Minkowskian approximation.</description>

      <title>New characterization of Robertson-Walker geometries involving a single timelike curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our aim in this paper is two-fold. We establish a novel geometric characterization of the Roberson-Walker (RW) spacetime and, along the process, we find a canonical form of the RW metric associated to an arbitrary timelike curve and an arbitrary space frame. A known characterization establishes that a spacetime foliated by constant curvature leaves whose orthogonal flow (the cosmological flow) is geodesic, shear-free, and with constant expansion on each leaf, is RW. We generalize this characterization by relaxing the condition on the expansion. We show it suffices to demand that the spatial gradient and Laplacian of the expansion on a single arbitrary timelike curve vanish. In General Relativity these local conditions are equivalent to demanding that the energy flux measured by the cosmological flow, as well as its divergence, are zero on a single arbitrary timelike curve. The proof allows us to construct canonically adapted coordinates to the arbitrary curve, thus well-fitted to an observer with an arbitrary motion with respect to the cosmological flow.</description>

      <title>The Non-Relativistic Geometric Trinity of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07100v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric trinity of gravity comprises three distinct formulations of general relativity: (i) the standard formulation describing gravity in terms of spacetime curvature, (ii) the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity describing gravity in terms of spacetime torsion, and (iii) the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) describing gravity in terms of spacetime non-metricity. In this article, we complete a geometric trinity of non-relativistic gravity, by (a) taking the non-relativistic limit of STEGR to determine its non-relativistic analogue, and (b) demonstrating that this non-metric theory is equivalent to the Newton--Cartan theory and its teleparallel equivalent, i.e., the curvature and the torsion based non-relativistic theories that are both geometrised versions of classical Newtonian gravity.</description>

      <title>Pleban\'ski-Demia\'nski \`a la Ehlers-Harrison: Exact Rotating and Accelerating Type I Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that type D black holes, encompassed in the large Pleban\'ski--Demia\'nski (PD) family, exhibit a wide class of algebraically general generalizations via the application of Ehlers and Harrison transformations. In this work, we first discuss some mathematical details behind the composition of such transformations, and next, we introduce a qualitative picture of the most general type I generalization of the PD family, dubbed ``Enhanced Pleban\'ski--Demia\'nski'' spacetime. We provide the exact form of the solution in the original PD coordinates, obtained via the simultaneous action of an Ehlers and a Harrison transformation on the vacuum PD geometry. In order to make the physics more transparent, we explicitly construct a rotating and accelerating black hole which further has NUT parameter and electric charges, both of them entering, not only the event horizon, but the Rindler horizon as well. This solution is directly obtained in the ``physical'' coordinates recently proposed by Podolsk\'y and Vr\'atny. Finally, a pedagogical appendix is thoughtfully included, providing readers with a user-friendly step-by-step guide to the Ernst formalism, in an attempt to address and resolve various minor inconsistencies frequently appearing in the relevant literature.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental process of detecting and examining the polarization modes of gravitational waves plays a pivotal role in enhancing our grasp on the precise mechanisms behind their generation. A thorough investigation is essential for delving deeper into the essence of gravitational waves and rigorously evaluating and validating the range of modified gravity theories. In this line of interest, a general description of black holes in theories beyond general relativity can serve a meaningful purpose where distinct deviation parameters can be mapped to solutions representing distinct theories. Employing a refined version of the deformed Kerr geometry, which is free from pathological behaviours such as unphysical divergences in the metric, we explore an extreme mass-ratio inspiral system, wherein a stellar-mass object perturbs a supermassive black hole. We compute the effects of deformation parameters on the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, orbital evolution and phase dynamics with leading order post-Newtonian corrections. With the waveform analysis, we assess the plausibility of detecting deviations from general relativity through observations facilitated by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), simultaneously constraining the extent of these deviations. Therefore, this analysis provides an understanding while highlighting the essential role of observations in advancing gravitational phenomena beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Dark energy evolution from quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If an ultraviolet fixed point renders quantum gravity renormalizable, the effective potential for a singlet scalar field -- the cosmon -- can be computed according to the corresponding scaling solution of the renormalization group equations. We associate the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the flow away from the fixed point with the scale of present dark energy density or even smaller. This results in a highly predictive scenario for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. It solves the cosmological constant problem dynamically, and may be called "quantum gravity quintessence". A first setting without quantum scale symmetry violation in the neutrino sector could explain the present amount of dark energy, but fails for the constraints on its time evolution. In contrast, a logarithmic scale symmetry violation in the beyond standard model sector responsible for the neutrino masses induces a non-vanishing cosmon-neutrino coupling in the Einstein frame. This yields a cosmology similar to growing neutrino quintessence, which could be compatible with present observations. The small number of unknown parameters turns the scaling solution for quantum gravity into a fundamental explanation of dynamical dark energy which can be falsified.</description>

Abstract: Observational data of the Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) shadow released by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) are used to investigate eventual deviations in the black hole shadow radius, aiming to seek physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) coming from extra-dimensional theory. We consider the brane-world scenario described by the Randall-Sundrum model and determine the black hole shadow radius correction owing to the higher dimension. From data of the shadow radius in units of BH mass determined by KECK- and VLTI-based estimates, we imposed restrictions on the deviation obtained, and one sets an upper limit to the curvature radius of Anti-de Sitter ($\mathrm{AdS_{5}}$) spacetime $\ell\lesssim4.3\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{AU}$ (at $95\%$ confidence level).</description>

      <title>Geometry-Information Duality: Quantum Entanglement Contributions to Gravitational Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental duality between the geometric properties of spacetime and the informational content of quantum fields. Specifically, we establish that the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the entanglement entropy of quantum states, with geometric invariants mapping to informational measures. This framework modifies Einstein's field equations by introducing an informational stress-energy tensor derived from quantum entanglement entropy. Our findings have implications for black hole thermodynamics, cosmology, and quantum gravity, suggesting that quantum information fundamentally shapes the structure of spacetime. We incorporate this informational stress-energy tensor into Einstein's field equations, leading to modified spacetime geometry, particularly in regimes of strong gravitational fields, such as near black holes. We compute corrections to Newton's constant (G) due to entanglement entropy contributions from various quantum fields and explore the consequences for black hole thermodynamics and cosmology. These corrections include explicit dependence on fundamental constants (h-bar, c, and k_B), ensuring dimensional consistency in our calculations. Our results indicate that quantum information plays a crucial role in gravitational dynamics, providing new insights into the nature of spacetime and potential solutions to long-standing challenges in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Flow of Primordial Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of primordial density fluctuations provide an exciting probe of the physics governing the earliest moments of our Universe. However, the standard approach to compute them is technically challenging. Theoretical predictions are therefore available only in restricted classes of theories. In this Letter, we present a complete method to systematically compute tree-level inflationary correlators. This method is based on following the time evolution of equal-time correlators and it accurately captures all physical effects in any theory. These theories are conveniently formulated at the level of inflationary fluctuations, and can feature any number of degrees of freedom with arbitrary dispersion relations and masses, coupled through any type of time-dependent interactions. We demonstrate the power of this approach by exploring the properties of the cosmological collider signal, a discovery channel for new high-energy physics, in theories with strong mixing and in the presence of features. This work lays the foundation for a universal program to assist our theoretical understanding of inflationary physics and generate theoretical data for an unbiased interpretation of upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IVa. Classification of manifolds using machine learning: a case study with small toroidal universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe may give rise to potentially measurable signatures in the cosmic microwave background. We explore different machine learning approaches to classify harmonic-space realizations of the microwave background in the test case of Euclidean $E_1$ topology (the 3-torus) with a cubic fundamental domain of a size scale significantly smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface. This is the first step toward developing a machine learning approach to classification of cosmic topology and likelihood-free inference of topological parameters. Different machine learning approaches are capable of classifying the harmonic-space realizations with accuracy greater than 99% if the topology scale is half of the diameter of the last-scattering surface and orientation of the topology is known. For distinguishing random rotations of these sky realizations from realizations of the covering space, the extreme gradient boosting classifier algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 88%. Slightly lower accuracies of 83% to 87% are obtained with the random forest classifier along with one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. The techniques presented here can also accurately classify non-rotated cubic $E_1$ topology realizations with a topology scale slightly larger than the diameter of the last-scattering surface, if enough training data are provided. While information compressing methods like most machine learning approaches cannot exceed the statistical power of a likelihood-based approach that captures all available information, they potentially offer a computationally cheaper alternative. A principle challenge appears to be accounting for arbitrary orientations of a given topology, although this is also a significant hurdle for likelihood-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Covariant and Manifestly Projective Invariant Formulation of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a recently formulated projectively invariant extension of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Projective geometry was used long ago by Thomas et. al. to succinctly package equivalent paths encoded by the geodesic equation. Projective invariance in gravity has further origins in string theory through a geometric action constructed from the method of coadjoint orbits using the Virasoro Algebra. A projectively invariant connection arises from this construction, a part of which is known as the diffeomorphism field. TW gravity exploits projective Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action functional to endow the diffeomorphism field with dynamics, while allowing the theory to collapse to general relativity in the limit that the diffeomorphism field vanishes and the connection becomes Levi-Civita. In the original formulation of TW gravity, the diffeomorphism field is projectively invariant but not tensorial and the connection is projectively invariant but not affine. In this paper we reformulate TW gravity in terms of projectively invariant tensor fields and a projectively invariant covariant derivative, derive field equations respecting these symmetries, and show that the field equations obtained are classically equivalent across formulations. This provides a 'Rosetta Stone' between this newly constructed covariant and projective invariant formulation of TW gravity and the original formulation that was manifestly projective invariant, but not covariant.</description>

      <title>Complementarity for a Dynamical Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity posits that the interior of a black hole is not independent from its Hawking radiation. This leads to an apparent violation of causality: the interior can be acausally affected by operators acting solely on the radiation. We argue that this perspective is misleading and that the black hole interior must be viewed as existing in the causal past of the Hawking radiation, despite the fact that they are spacelike separated in the semiclassical description. Consequently, no operation on the Hawking radiation -- no matter how complex -- can affect the experience of an infalling observer. The black hole interior and the radiation only appear spacelike separated in the semiclassical description because an infalling observer's ability to access complex information is limited; the chaotic dynamics on the horizon, as viewed from the exterior, then converts any effect caused by such an observer to information in the Hawking radiation which cannot be accessed at the semiclassical level. We arrive at the picture described above by considering a unitary exterior description in which the flow of information is strictly causal, which we extend to apply throughout the entire history of black hole evolution, including its formation. This description uses the stretched event horizon as an inner edge of spacetime, on which the information inside is holographically encoded. We argue that the global spacetime picture arises from coarse-graining over black hole microstates, and discuss its relationship with the exterior description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize three complementary approaches to pinpoint the exact form of scattering amplitudes in Schwarzschild spacetime. First, we solve the Regge-Wheeler equation perturbatively in the small-frequency regime. We use the obtained solutions to determine the monodromy in the near-spatial infinity region, which leads to a specific partial differential equation on the elements of the scattering matrix. As a result, it can be written in terms of the elements of the infinitesimal generator of the monodromy transformation and an integration constant. This constant is further related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili free energy through the resummation of infinitely many instantons. The quasinormal mode frequencies are also studied in the small-frequency approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of special functions called multiple polyexponential integrals, defined as iterated integrals of the exponential integral $\text{Ei}(z)$. These functions arise in certain perturbative expansions of the local solutions of second-order ODEs around an irregular singularity. In particular, their recursive definition describes the asymptotic behavior of these local solutions. To complement the study of the multiple polyexponential integrals on the entire complex plane, we relate them with two other sets of special functions - the undressed and dressed multiple polyexponential functions - which are characterized by their Taylor series expansions around the origin.</description>
