      <title>On the existence of Newton series and the asymptotics of finite differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose a complex function $f$ has a Lebesgue measurable inverse Laplace transform. We show that the $n$th order forward and backward differences of $f$ at $z_0\in\mathbb{C}$ tend to zero as $n\to\infty$ whenever $z_0$ lies in the region of absolute convergence of $f$. Under the same hypothesis, we show that the Newton series of $f$ centered at $z_0$ exists and converges in the half-plane $\Re(z)&gt;\Re(z_0)$. Assuming instead that $f$ has a Lebesgue measurable inverse Fourier transform, we show that the $n$th order forward, backward, and central differences of $f$ at any $y\in\mathbb{R}$ are $o(2^n)$. Consequently, we show that the binomial sum $\sum_{k\geq0}{n\choose k}f(k)$ is $o(2^n)$.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of a rational map is Carath\'eodory hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a rational map of degree $d\geq 2$. The moduli space $\mathcal{M}_f$, introduced by McMullen and Sullivan, is a complex analytic space consisting all quasiconformal conjugacy classes of $f$. For $f$ that is not flexible Latt\`es, we show that there is a normal affine variety $X_f$ of dimension $2d-2$ and a holomorphic injection $i:\mathcal{M}_f\to X_f$ such that $i(\mathcal{M}_f)$ is precompact in $X_f$. In particular $\mathcal{M}_f$ is Carath\'eodory hyperbolic (i.e. bounded holomorphic functions separate points in $\mathcal{M}_f$), provided that $f$ is not flexible Latt\`es. This solves a conjecture of McMullen. When $d\geq 4$, we give a concrete construction of $X_f$ as the normalization of the Zariski closure of the image of the reciprocal multiplier spectrum morphism.</description>

      <title>Extremal problems in BMO and VMO involving the Garsia norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $L^2$ function $f$ on the unit circle $\mathbb T$, we put $$\Phi_f(z):=\mathcal P(|f|^2)(z)-|\mathcal Pf(z)|^2,\qquad z\in\mathbb D,$$ where $\mathbb D$ is the open unit disk and $\mathcal P$ is the Poisson integral operator. The Garsia norm $\|f\|_G$ is then defined as $\sup_{z\in\mathbb D}\left(\Phi_f(z)\right)^{1/2}$, and the space ${\rm BMO}$ is formed by the functions $f\in L^2$ with $\|f\|_G&lt;\infty$. If $\|f\|^2_G=\Phi_f(z_0)$ for some point $z_0\in\mathbb D$, then $f$ is said to be a norm-attaining ${\rm BMO}$ function, written as $f\in{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$. Note that ${\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$ contains ${\rm VMO}$, the space of functions with vanishing mean oscillation. We study, first, the functions $f$ in $L^\infty$ (as well as in $L^\infty\cap{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$) with the property that $\|f\|_G=\|f\|_\infty$. The analytic case, where $L^\infty$ gets replaced by $H^\infty$, is discussed in more detail. Secondly, we prove that every function $f\in{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$ with $\|f\|_G=1$ is an extreme point of ${\rm ball}\,({\rm BMO})$, the unit ball of ${\rm BMO}$ with respect to the Garsia norm. This implies that the extreme points of ${\rm ball}\,({\rm VMO})$ are precisely the unit-norm ${\rm VMO}$ functions. As another consequence, we arrive at an amusing "geometric" characterization of inner functions.</description>

      <title>Null projections and noncommutative function theory in operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study projections in the bidual of a $C^*$-algebra $B$ that are null with respect to a subalgebra $A$, that is projections $p\in B^{**}$ satisfying $|\phi|(p)=0$ for every $\phi\in B^*$ annihilating $A$. In the separable case, $A$-null projections are precisely the peak projections in the bidual of $A$ at which the subalgebra $A$ interpolates the entire $C^*$-algebra $B$. These are analogues of null sets in classical function theory, on which several profound results rely. This motivates the development of a noncommutative variant, which we use to find appropriate `quantized' versions of some of these classical facts. Through a delicate generalization of a theorem of Varopoulos, we show that, roughly speaking, sufficiently regular interpolation projections are null precisely when their atomic parts are. As an application, we give alternative proofs and sharpenings of some recent peak-interpolation results of Davidson and Hartz for algebras on Hilbert function spaces, also illuminating thereby how earlier noncommutative peak-interpolation theory may be applied. In another direction, given a convex subset of the state space of $B$, we characterize when the associated Riesz projection is null. This is then applied to various important topics in noncommutative function theory, such as the F.&amp; M. Riesz property, the existence of Lebesgue decompositions, the description of Henkin functionals, and Arveson's noncommutative Hardy spaces (maximal subdiagonal algebras).</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We present complete classifications of paired operators on the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ and Toeplitz + Hankel operators on vector-valued Hardy spaces. We introduce the notion of inner-paired operators defined on the Hardy space that use the classical model spaces. We fully classify inner-paired operators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Gromov hyperbolizations of unbounded locally complete and incomplete metric spaces associated with three hyperbolic type metrics: the hyperbolization metric introduced by Ibragimov, the distance ratio metric, and the quasihyperbolic metric. As an application, we obtain a Gromov hyperbolic characterization of unbounded uniform domains in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Defining equations of $7$-dimensional model CR hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a complete normal form for models of real analytic uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, and present a detailed study of their local invariants. The normal form illustrates that $2$-nondegenerate models in $\mathbb{C}^4$ comprise a moduli space parameterized by two univariate holomorphic functions, which is in sharp contrast to the well known Levi-nondegenerate setting and the more recently discovered behavior of $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^3$. In further contrast to these previously studied settings, we demonstrate that not all $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^4$ arise as perturbations of homogeneous models. We derive defining equations for the homogeneous models, a set of $9$ structures, and find explicit formulas for their infinitesimal symmetries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the boundary behavior of bounded pluriharmonic functions on the Teichm\"uller space. We will show a version of the Fatou theorem that every bounded pluriharmonic function admits the radial limits along the Teichm\"uller geodesic rays, and a version of the F. and M. Riesz theorem that the radial limit of a non-constant bounded holomorphic function is not constant on any non-null measurable set on the Bers boundary in terms of the pluriharmonic measure. As a corollary, we obtain the non-ergodicity of the action of the Torelli group for a closed surface of genus $g\ge 2$ on the space of projective measured foliations.</description>

Abstract: We study parabolic semigroups of finite shift in the unit disk with regard to the rate of convergence of their orbits to the Denjoy--Wolff point. We examine this rate in terms of Euclidean distance, hyperbolic distance and harmonic measure. In each case, we provide explicit examples to display the sharpness of the results. We further discuss the corresponding rates of convergence for parabolic semigroups of positive hyperbolic step and infinite shift.</description>

      <title>On algebras of Dirichlet series invariant under permutations of coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr O_u$ be the algebra of holomorphic functions on ${\bf C}_+:=\{s\in{\bf C}:\text{Re }s&gt;0\}$ that are limits of Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, $s\in \bf{C}_+$, that converge uniformly on proper half-planes of $\bf{C}_+$. We study algebraic-topological properties of subalgebras of $\mathscr O_u$: the Banach algebras $\mathscr W, \mathscr A, \mathscr H^\infty$ and the Frechet algebra $\mathscr O_b$. Here $\mathscr W$ consists of functions in $\mathscr O_u$ of absolutely convergent Dirichlet series on the closure of $\bf{C}_+$, $\mathscr A$ is the uniform closure of $\mathscr W$, $\mathscr H^\infty$ is the algebra of all bounded functions in $\mathscr O_u$, and $\mathscr O_b$ is set of all $f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$ in $\mathscr O_u$ so that $f_r\in \mathscr H^\infty$, $r\in (0,1)$, where $f_r(s):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n r^{\Omega(n)} n^{-s}$ and $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$. Let $S_\bf{N}$ be the group of permutations of $\bf{N}$. Each $\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ determines a permutation $\hat\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ (i.e., such that $\hat\sigma(mn)=\hat\sigma(n)\hat\sigma(m)$ for all $m,n\in \bf{N}$) via the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For a Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, and $\sigma \in S_\bf{N}$, $S_\sigma(D)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\hat{\sigma}^{-1}(n)} n^{-s}$ determines an action of $S_\bf{N}$ on the set of all Dirichlet series. It is shown that each of the algebras above is invariant with respect to this action. Given a subgroup $G$ of $S_\bf{N}$, the set of $G$-invariant subalgebras of these algebras are studied, and their maximal ideal spaces are described, and used to characterise groups of units and of invertible elements having logarithms, find the stable rank, show projective freeness, and describe when the special linear group is generated by elementary matrices, with bounds on the number of factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.09220v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 9We consider complex structures with totally real zero section of the tangent bundle. We assume that the complex structure tensor is real-analytic along the fibers of the tangent bundle. This assumption is quite natural in view of a well known existence result by Bruhat and Whitney. We provide explicit integrability equations for such complex structures in terms of the fiberwise Taylor expansion. In a particular geometric case considered in the literature, we explicit much further the fiberwise Taylor expansion of the complex structure as well as the integrability equations.</description>

Abstract: A commuting tuple of Hilbert space operators $(T_1, \dotsc, T_n)$ is said to be an \textit{$\mathbb{A}_r^n$-contraction} if the closure of the polyannulus
  \[
  \mathbb A_r^n=\left\{(z_1, \dotsc, z_n) \ : \ r&lt;|z_i|&lt;1, \ 1 \leq i \leq n \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n \qquad \quad (0&lt;r&lt;1)
  \]
  is a spectral set for $(T_1, \dotsc, T_n)$. We find characterizations for the $\mathbb A_r^n$-unitaries and $\mathbb A_r^n$-isometries and decipher their structures. We find Wold type decompositions for any number of commuting and doubly commuting $\mathbb A_r$-isometries. Then we generalize these results to any family of commuting and doubly commuting $\mathbb A_r$-contractions.</description>

Abstract: Any power series with nonnegative coefficients has an associated family of probability distributions supported on the nonnegative integers. There is a close connection between the function theoretic properties of the power series and the moments of the family of distributions. In this paper, we describe that interplay, provide simpler proofs of some known results by emphasizing the probabilistic perspective, and present some new theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the local geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x}=F(x)$ with real time parameterization, where $F$ is holomorphic on connected open subsets of $\mathbb{C}\stackrel{\sim}{=}\mathbb{R}^2$. We describe the geometry of first-order equilibria. For equilibria of higher orders, we establish an equivalent condition for "definite directions", allowing us to reverse the implication in Theorem 2 of Chapter 2.10 in [Differential equations and dynamical systems, Lawrence Perko (1990)] under the additional condition of holomorphy. This enables the geometric construction of a finite elliptic decomposition. We derive a holomorphic Poincar\'e-Bendixson-type theorem, leading to the conclusion that bounded non-periodic orbits are always homoclinic or heteroclinic.</description>
