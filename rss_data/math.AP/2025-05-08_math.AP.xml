      <title>An infinite dimensional saddle point theorem and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the $\tau$-topology of Kryszewski and Szulkin, we establish a natural new version of the Saddle Theorem for strongly indefinite functionals. The abstract result will be applied for studying the existence of a nontrivial solution of the strongly indefinite semilinear Schr\"odinger equation where the associated functional is indefinite, that is, the functional is of the form $J(u) = \dfrac{1}{2} \langle Lu, u \rangle - \Psi(u)$ defined on a Hilbert
  space $X$, where $L : X \to X$ is a self-adjoint operator with negative and positive eigenspace both infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Liouville type theorems for the fractional Navier-Stokes equations without the integrability condition of velocity in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the classification of solutions of harmonic functions, we investigate Liouville type theorems for the fractional Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ under some conditions on the boundedness of fractional derivatives. We prove that the smooth solution must be a trivial solution provided that it uniformly converges to a nonzero constant vector at infinity by applying Lizorkin's multiplier theorem to establish \(L^p\) estimates for the fractional linear Oseen system and Coifman-McIntosh-Meyer type commutator estimates for the dissipation term. It is noteworthy that the integrability of velocity is not required here.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for one-dimensional dynamical Dirac system (BC-method)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A forward problem for the Dirac system is to find $u=\begin{pmatrix}u_1(x,t)\\u_2(x,t)\end{pmatrix}$ obeying $iu_t+\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1\\-1&amp;0\end{pmatrix}u_x+\begin{pmatrix}p&amp;q\\q&amp;-p\end{pmatrix}u=0$ for $x&gt;0,\,t&gt;0$;\,\,$u(x,0)=\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}$ for $x {\geqslant} 0 $, and $u_1(0,t)=f(t)$ for $t&gt;0$, with the real $p=p(x), q=q(x)$. An input--output map $R: u_1(0,\cdot)\mapsto u_2(0,\cdot)$ is of the convolution form $Rf=if+r\ast f$, where $r=r(t)$ is a {\it response function}. By hyperbolicity of the system, for any $T&gt;0$, function $r\big|_{0 {\leqslant} t {\leqslant} 2T}$ is determined by $p,q\big|_{0 {\leqslant} x {\leqslant} T}$.
  An inverse problem is: for an (arbitrary) fixed $T&gt;0$, given $r\big|_{0 {\leqslant} t {\leqslant} 2T}$ to recover $p,q\big|_{0 {\leqslant} x {\leqslant} T}$. The procedure that determines $p,q$ is proposed, and the characteristic solvability conditions on $r$ are provided.
  Our approach is purely time-domain and is based on studying the controllability properties of the Dirac system. In itself the system is not controllable: the local completeness of states does not hold, but its relevant extension gains controllability. It is the fact, which enables one to apply the boundary control method for solving the inverse problem.</description>

      <title>On the local well-posedness of strong solutions to the unsteady flows of shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluids with a concentration-dependent power-law index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a system of nonlinear partial differential equations modeling the unsteady flow of a shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluid with a concentration-dependent power-law index. The system consists of the generalized Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a convection-diffusion equation describing the evolution of chemical concentration. This model arises from the mathematical description of the behavior of synovial fluid in the cavities of articulating joints. We prove the existence of a local-in-time strong solution in a three-dimensional spatially periodic domain, assuming that $\frac{7}{5} &lt; p^- \le p(\cdot) \le p^+ \le 2$, where $p(\cdot)$ denotes the variable power-law index and $p^-$ and $p^+$ are its lower and upper bounds, respectively. Furthermore, we prove the uniqueness of the solution under the additional condition $p^+ &lt; \frac{28}{15}$. In particular, our three-dimensional analysis directly implies the existence and uniqueness of solutions in the two-dimensional case under the less restrictive condition $1 &lt; p^- \le p(\cdot) \le p^+ \le 2$.</description>

      <title>Sharp asymptotic stability of the incompressible porous media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the asymptotic stability of the incompressible porous media (IPM) equation near a stable stratified density, for initial perturbations in the Sobolev space \( H^k \) with any \( 2&lt;k \in\mathbb{R} \). While it is known that such a steady state is unstable in \( H^2 \), our result establishes a sharp stability threshold in higher-order Sobolev spaces.
  The key ingredients of our proof are twofold. First, we extract long-time convergence from the decay of a potential energy functional{--despite its non-coercive nature--thereby revealing a variational structure underlying the dynamics.} Second, we derive refined commutator estimates to control the evolution of higher Sobolev norms throughout the full range of $k&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Optimal time-decay for Euler-Fourier system with damping in the critical $L^2$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the large time behavior of solutions to the Euler-Fourier system with damping in $\mathbb{R}^{d}~(d\geq1)$. A time-weighted energy argument has been developed within the $L^2$ framework to derive the optimal time-decay rates, which enables us to remove the smallness of low-frequencies of initial data. A great part of our analysis relies on the study of a Lyapunov functional in the spirit of [13], which mainly depends on some elaborate use of non-classical Besov product estimates and interpolations. Exhibiting a damped mode with faster time decay than the whole solution also plays a key role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of blowing-up families of solutions to an equation of Hardy-Sobolev type in high dimensions. These families are of minimal type. The sole condition is that the potential of the linear operator touches a critical potential at the singular point. This condition is sharp as shown by the first author in [Cheikh-Ali, Pacific J. of Math. 2022].</description>

      <title>Morawetz type estimate for damped wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 4)$ and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a Morawetz type etimate for the linear inhomogeneous wave equation with time-dependent scale invariant damping in $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 4)$. The novelty is that we view the differential operator $\Box+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_t$ as $n+1+\mu$ dimensional operator, then a well-matched multiplier is introduced. As an application, a sharp global existence result for the small data Cauchy problem of the semilinear wave equation \[ \partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\partial_tu}{t}=|u|^p,~~~t&gt;t_0\geq 0 \] is obtained in $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 4)$.</description>

      <title>An isoperimetric inequality for twisted eigenvalues with one orthogonality constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider twisted eigenvalues $\lambda_{1}^{g}(\Omega)$, defined as the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient of functions in $H^1_{0}(\Omega)$ that are orthogonal to a given function $g\in L^2_\text{loc}(\mathbb R^d)$. We prove an isoperimetric inequality for $\lambda_1^g(\Omega)$, which provides a uniform bound on twisted eigenvalues -- not only with respect to the domain $\Omega$ (an open bounded set of $\mathbb R^d$) -- but also in relation to the orthogonality function $g$. Remarkably, the lower bound is uniquely attained when $\Omega$ is the union of two disjoint balls of specific radii, and when the function $g$ in the orthogonality constraint is of bang-bang type, i.e., constant on each ball. As a consequence, we obtain a continuous 1-parameter family of optimal sets -- each being the union of two disjoint balls -- that interpolates between the optimal shapes of the first two Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian.
  This new isoperimetric inequality offers fresh perspectives on well established results, such as the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\H{o} and the Freitas-Henrot inequalities. Notably, in these particular cases our proof avoids reliance on Bessel functions, suggesting potential extensions to nonlinear settings.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with potential: the purely Sobolev critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$, $N\ge3$, with prescribed $L^2$-norm, for the (stationary) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Sobolev critical power nonlinearity. It is well known that, in the free case, the associated energy functional has a mountain pass geometry on the $L^2$-sphere. This boils down, in higher dimensions, to the existence of a mountain pass solution which is (a suitable scaling of) the Aubin-Talenti function. In this paper, we consider the same problem, in presence of a weakly attractive, possibly irregular, potential, wondering (i) whether a local minimum solution appears, thus providing an orbitally stable family of solitons, and (ii) if the existence of a mountain-pass solution persists. We provide positive answers, depending on suitable assumptions on the potential and on the mass value.
  Moreover, by the Hopf-Cole transform, we give some applications of our results to the existence of multiple solutions to ergodic Mean Field Games systems with potential and quadratic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Interface Models for Two-Phase Flows with Phase Transition: Modeling and Existence of Weak Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of two macroscopically immiscible, viscous, incompressible fluids with unmatched densities is studied, where a transfer of mass between the constituents by phase transition is taken into account. To this end, two quasi-incompressible diffuse interface models with singular free energies are analyzed, differing primarily in their velocity averaging. Firstly, to generalize a model by Abels, Garcke, and Gr\"un, a thermodynamically consistent system of Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard type with source terms is derived in a framework of continuum fluid dynamics, followed by a proof of existence of weak solutions to the latter. Secondly, the quasi-stationary version of a model by Aki, Dreyer, Giesselmann, and Kraus is investigated analytically, with existence of weak solutions being established for the resulting quasi-stationary Stokes system coupled to a Cahn--Hilliard equation with a source term.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove a regularization by noise phenomenon for the energy-critical and mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We show that for any deterministic data, the probability that the corresponding solution exists globally and scatters goes to one as the strength of the non-conservative noise goes to infinity. The proof relies on the rescaling transform and a new observation on the rapid uniform decay of geometric Brownian motions after short time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two-dimensional water waves with constant vorticity, under the action of gravity and surface tension, in a fluid domain with finite depth and general bottom topography. We present a formulation which generalizes the one by Zakharov-Craig-Sulem for irrotational water waves, and the one by Constantin-Ivanov-Prodanov for water waves with constant vorticity and flat bottom topography. We study in detail an operator which appears in such formulation, extending well-known results for the classical Dirichlet-Neumann operator, such as an analiticity result, the Taylor expansion in homogeneous powers of the wave profile, and a paralinearization formula. As an application, we prove a local well-posedness result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a numerical analysis of the strong stabilization and polynomial decay of solutions for the initial boundary value problem associated with a system that models the dynamics of a mixture of two rigid solids with porosity. This mathematical model accounts for the complex interactions between the rigid components and their porous structure, providing valuable information on the mechanical behavior of such systems. Our primary objective is to establish conditions under which stabilization is ensured and to rigorously quantify the rate of decay of the solutions. Using numerical simulations, we assess the effectiveness of different stabilization mechanisms and analyze the influence of key system parameters on the overall dynamics.</description>

      <title>A mixed finite element method for a class of fourth-order stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete, semi-implicit mixed finite element method for approximating solutions to a class of fourth-order stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz and non-monotone nonlinearities, perturbed by spatially smooth multiplicative Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme is applicable to a range of physically relevant nonlinear models, including the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (sLLBar) equation, the stochastic convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with mass source, and the stochastic regularised Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, among others. To overcome the difficulties posed by the interplay between the nonlinearities and the stochastic forcing, we adopt a `truncate-then-discretise' strategy: the nonlinear term is first truncated before discretising the resulting modified problem. We show that the strong solution to the truncated problem converges in probability to that of the original problem. A fully discrete numerical scheme is then proposed for the truncated system, and we establish both convergence in probability and strong convergence (with quantitative rates) for the two fields used in the mixed formulation.</description>

      <title>Existence of metrics maximizing the first Laplace eigenvalue on closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on seminal work of Nadirashvili and previous work of the authors, we prove the existence of metrics maximizing the area-normalized first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on every closed nonorientable surface, and give a simple new proof of existence in the orientable case complementing that of [Pet24b], thus resolving the long-standing existence problem for $\lambda_1$-maximizing metrics on closed surfaces of any topology. Namely, we prove by contradiction that the supremum $\Lambda_1(M)$ of the normalized first eigenvalue over all metrics on $M$ obeys the strict monotonicity $\Lambda_1(M\#\mathbb{RP}^2)&gt;\Lambda_1(M)$ and $\Lambda_1(M\#\mathbb{T}^2)&gt;\Lambda_1(M)$ under the attachment of cross-caps and handles, via a substantial refinement of techniques introduced in [KKMS24].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $3d$ energy critical nonlinear Schr\" odinger equation with data distributed according to the Gaussian measure with covariance operator $(1-\Delta)^{-s}$, where $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator and $s$ is sufficiently large. We prove that the flow sends full measure sets to full measure sets. We also discuss some simple applications. This extends a previous result by Planchon-Visciglia and the second author from $1d$ to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Face 2-phase: how much overdetermination is enough to get symmetry in two-phase problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a full characterization of multi-phase problems under a large class of overdetermined Serrin-type conditions. Our analysis includes both symmetry and asymmetry (including bifurcation) results. A broad range of techniques is needed to obtain a full characterization of all the cases, including applications of results obtained via the moving planes method, approaches via integral identities in the wake of Weinberger, applications of the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem, and the Chauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem. The multi-phase setting entails intrinsic difficulties that make it difficult to predict whether a given overdetermination will lead to symmetry or asymmetry results; the results of our analysis are significant as they answer such a question providing a full characterization of both symmetry and asymmetry results.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions to the Landau-Coulomb equation in $L^{3/2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous Landau equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Coulomb potential and initial data in polynomially weighted $L^{3/2}$. We show that there exists a smooth solution that is bounded for all positive times. The proof is based on short-time regularization estimates for the Fisher information, which, combined with the recent result of Guillen and Silvestre, yields the existence of a global-in-time smooth solution. Additionally, if the initial data belongs to $L^p$ with $p&gt;3/2$, there is a unique solution.
  At the crux of the result is a new $\varepsilon$-regularity criterion in the spirit of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theorem: a solution which is small in weighted $L^{3/2}$ is regular. Although the $L^{3/2}$ norm is a critical quantity for the Landau-Coulomb equation, using this norm to measure the regularity of solutions presents significant complications. For instance, the $L^{3/2}$ norm alone is not enough to control the $L^\infty$ norm of the competing reaction and diffusion coefficients. These analytical challenges caused prior methods relying on the parabolic structure of the Landau-Coulomb to break down.
  Our new framework is general enough to handle slowly decaying and singular initial data, and provides the first proof of global well-posedness for the Landau-Coulomb equation with rough initial data.</description>

      <title>The free boundary for semilinear problems with highly oscillating singular terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate general semilinear (obstacle-like) problems of the form $\Delta u = f(u)$, where $f(u)$ has a singularity/jump at $\{u=0\}$ giving rise to a free boundary. Unlike many works on such equations where $f$ is approximately homogeneous near $u = 0$, we work under assumptions allowing for highly oscillatory behavior.
  We establish the $C^\infty$ regularity of the free boundary $\partial \{u&gt;0\}$ at flat points. Our approach is to first establish that flat free boundaries are Lipschitz, using a comparison argument with the Kelvin transform. For higher regularity, we study the highly degenerate PDE satisfied by ratios of derivatives of $u$, using changes of variable and then the hodograph transform. Along the way, we prove and make use of new Caffarelli-Peral type $W^{1, p}$ estimates for such degenerate equations. Much of our approach appears new even in the case of Alt-Phillips and classical obstacle problems.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear elasticity model in computer vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze a nonlinear elasticity model introduced by the authors for comparing two images, regarded as bounded open subsets of $\R^n$ together with associated vector-valued intensity maps. Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.
  The question is studied as to whether for images related by an affine mapping the unique minimiser is given by that affine mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimisers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of affinely related images.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Lp Minkowski problem in the supercritical range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $L_p$-Minkowski problem plays a central role in the convex geometry, after the cornerstone work of Chou-Wang (Adv. Math., {\bf205}, 2006) for the existence and uniqueness theorems. In this paper, we study the uniqueness problem of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem in the supercritical range $p&lt;-n-1$ for all higher dimensional cases $n\geq2$. We will prove that for $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$, the unique strongly symmetric solution is given by the unit sphere ${\S}^n$. The uniqueness range $(-2n-5,-n-1)$ is optimal due to our recent preprint (arXiv: 2104.07426), where we have constructed non-spherical strongly symmetric solutions for all $p\in(-\infty,-2n-5)$. When considering general solutions may not be symmetric, the uniqueness set $\Gamma$ of $p$ for which the uniqueness holds, is shown to be both relatively open and closed in the full interval $(-2n-5,-n-1)$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\be^2 &gt; 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing a physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and establishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative Gaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\be^2 = 2\pi$. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for cone multipliers. Moreover, the probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\be^2 = 6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite surprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold at $\be^2 =8\pi$.</description>

      <title>Stability inequalities with explicit constants for a family of reverse Sobolev inequalities on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a stability inequality associated to the reverse Sobolev inequality on the sphere $\mathbb S^n$, for the full admissible parameter range $s - \frac{n}{2} \in (0,1) \cup (1,2)$. To implement the classical proof of Bianchi and Egnell, we overcome the main difficulty that the underlying operator $A_{2s}$ is not positive definite.
  As a consequence of our analysis and recent results from Gong et al. (arXiv:2503.20350 [math.AP]), the case $s - \frac{n}{2} \in (1,2)$ remarkably constitutes the first example of a Sobolev-type stability inequality (i) whose best constant is explicit and (ii) which does not admit an optimizer.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove rigidity results for classical solutions to the stationary 2D Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Assuming that the velocity field has finite energy and that the stagnation set is connected, we prove that the corresponding stream function solves an autonomous semilinear elliptic equation. Under some extra conditions on the vorticity near infinity we can also prove that the streamlines are concentric circles. The proofs include several energy estimates on the behavior of the stream function at infinity, as well as an adaptation of the continuous Steiner symmetrization to our setting.</description>

      <title>Martingale Suitable Weak Solutions of $3$-D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Vorticity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct martingale suitable weak solutions for $3$-dimensional incompressible stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with generally non-linear noise. In deterministic setting, as widely known, ``suitable weak solutions'' are Leray-Hopf weak solutions enjoying two different types of local energy inequalities (LEIs). In stochastic setting, we apply the idea of ``martingale solution", avoid transforming to random system, and show new stochastic versions of the two local energy inequalities. In particular, in additive and linear multiplicative noise case, OU-processes and the exponential formulas DO NOT play a role in our formulation of LEIs. This is different to \cite{FR02,Rom10} where the additive noise case is dealt. Also, we successfully apply the concept of ``a.e. super-martingale'' to describe this local energy behavior. To relate the well-known ``dissipative weak solutions" come up with in \cite{DR00}, we derive a local energy equality and extend the concept onto stochastic setting naturally. For further regularity of solutions, we are able to bound the $L^\infty\big([0,T];L^1(\Omega\times\mathbb T^3)\big)$ norm of the vorticity and $L^{\frac{4}{3+\delta}}\big(\Omega\times[0,T]\times\mathbb T^3\big)$ norm of the gradient of the vorticity, in case that the initial vorticity is a finite regular signed measure.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $\alpha$-dissipative solutions to the Cauchy problem of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$, can be computed numerically with order $\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{{1}/{8}}+\Delta x^{{\beta}/{4}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, provided there exist constants $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$. The derived convergence rate is exemplified by a number of numerical experiments.</description>
