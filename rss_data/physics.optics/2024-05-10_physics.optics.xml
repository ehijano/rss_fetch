      <title>A Highly Efficient Hybrid Fiber Optic Laser Using a Cesium Atom Vapor Cell as an Optical Gain Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new scheme of a highly efficient hybrid laser cavity is proposed and experimentally demonstrated utilizing a hot cesium (Cs) vapor cell as an optical gain medium. The laser cavity consists of a macroscopic concave reflecting mirror (&gt;99% reflectivity) and a 4% Fresnel-reflecting perpendicularly cleaved facet of a single mode fiber (SMF). The cylindrical cesium gain cell is located between these two reflectors. The SMF serves multiple roles: 1) a passive mode-matching component to approximate the pump beam diameter to that of the laser cavity mode within the cesium cell, 2) an output coupler with low reflectivity, and 3) a high beam-quality laser delivery with a low loss. Optimizing the pump beam waist diameter and the cesium vapor cell temperature, a high slope efficiency of 86% and continuous wave power of 419 mW were obtained in the pump power range of 400 to 600 mW, with an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 71%. The unique multi-functional role of the SMF in the hybrid cavity is fully described, and it can also be applied to other phases of high optical gain media.</description>

      <title>Diffraction casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing is considered a promising solution for the growing demand for parallel computing in various cutting-edge fields, requiring high integration and high speed computational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel optical computation architecture called diffraction casting (DC) for flexible and scalable parallel logic operations. In DC, a diffractive neural network (DNN) is designed for single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations. This approach allows for the alteration of logic operations simply by changing the illumination patterns. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for encoding and decoding the input and output, respectively, by introducing a buffer around the input area, facilitating end-to-end all-optical computing. We numerically demonstrate DC by performing all 16 logic operations on two arbitrary 256 bits parallel binary inputs. Additionally, we showcase several distinctive attributes inherent in DC, such as the benefit of cohesively designing the diffractive elements for SIMD logic operations, assuring high scalability and integration capability. Our study offers a novel design architecture for optical computers and paves the way for a next-generation optical computing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Plasmonic Refractive Index Sensors Based on SU-8 Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic refractive index sensors are essential for detecting subtle variations in the ambient environment through surface plasmon interactions. Current efforts utilizing CMOS-compatible, plasmo-photonic Mach-Zehnder interferometers with active power balancing exhibit high sensitivities at the cost of fabrication and measurement complexity. Alternatively, passive bimodal plasmonic interferometers based on SU-8 waveguides present a cost-effective solution with a smaller device footprint, though they currently lack opto-mechanical isolation due to exposed photonic waveguides. In this work, we introduce innovative polymer-core and polymer-cladded bimodal plasmonic refractive index sensors with high refractive index contrast. Our sensors feature an aluminum stripe, a bilayer SU-8 photonic waveguide core, and the experimental optical cladding polymer SX AR LWL 2.0. They achieve a sensitivity of (6300 $\pm$ 460) nm/RIU (refractive index unit), surpassing both traditional and polymer-based plasmo-photonic sensors. This approach enables integrated, wafer-scale, CMOS-compatible, and low-cost sensors and facilitates plasmonic refractive index sensing platforms for various applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear vibrational spectrometer for bioapplications featuring narrowband 1-$\mu$m pulses and a recycled OPA pump beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving the detection wavelength in vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy to the near-infrared (&gt; 700 nm) can potentially enable the study of molecular interfaces absorbing in the visible and give access to buried bio-interfaces at minimal absorption, reduced scattering, and negligible autofluorescence. Here, we employ an ultra-narrow bandpass thin-film optical interference filter on 180-fs, 1.03-$\mu$m laser pulses to generate an upconversion beam yielding a spectral resolution of 5 cm$^{-1}$ and VSFG wavelengths between 890 and 980 nm for molecular vibrations in the fingerprint region. We demonstrate that the beam rejected by the filter can be utilized for driving a supercontinuum-seeded near-infrared optical parametric amplifier serving as the front-end of a broadband LiGaS$_{2}$-based mid-infrared amplifier. Benchmark data on a phospholipid monolayer at the air-water interface acquired using the resulting VSFG spectrometer show the possibility of achieving high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio at short acquisition times. The scheme can also be utilized in other types of vibrational spectroscopy that derive their spectral resolution from bandpass-filtering of femtosecond near-infrared laser pulses, such as stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Coherent Vibrational Dynamics with X-ray Transient Absorption Spectroscopy Simultaneously at the Carbon K- and Chlorine L$_{2,3}$- Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray Transient Absorption Spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (1s, $\sim$ 285 eV) and chlorine L$_{2,3}$ edges (2p, $\sim$ 200 eV) is used to study the nuclear dynamics of CCl$_4$ vibrationally activated by impulsive stimulated Raman scattering with a few-cycle 800 nm pump pulse. The totally symmetric stretching mode leads to a strong response in the inner-shell spectra, with the concerted elongation (contraction) in bond lengths leading to a red (blue) shift in the X-ray absorption energies associated with core-to-antibonding excitations. The relative slopes of the potential energy surfaces associated with the relevant core-excited states along the symmetric stretching mode are experimentally measured and compared to results from restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham calculations. A combination of experiment and theory indicates that the slope of the core-excited potential energy surface vs totally symmetric bond elongation is $-11.1 \pm 0.8$ eV/{\AA} for the Cl 2p$\to7a_1^*$ excitation, $-9.0\pm0.6$ eV/{\AA} for the Cl 2p$\to8t_2^*$ excitation and $-5.2\pm 0.4$ eV/{\AA} for the C 1s$\to8t_2^*$ excitation, to 95% confidence. The much larger slopes for the Cl 2p excitations compared to the C 1s state are attributed to greater contributions from Cl to the $7a_1^*$ or $8t_2^*$ antibonding orbitals to which the inner-shell electrons are being excited. No net displacement of the center of the vibrational wavefunction along the other vibrational modes is induced by the pump pulse, leading to absence of transient signal. The results highlight the ability of X-ray Transient Absorption Spectroscopy to reveal nuclear dynamics involving tiny ($&lt;0.01$ {\AA}) atomic displacements and also provide direct measurement of forces on core-excited potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Transformer neural networks for closed-loop adaptive optics using non-modulated pyramid wavefront sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PyWFS) is highly nonlinear and requires the use of beam modulation to successfully close an AO loop under varying atmospheric turbulence conditions, at the expense of a loss in sensitivity. In this work we train, analyse, and compare the use of deep neural networks (NNs) as non-linear estimators for the non-modulated PyWFS, identifying the most suitable NN architecture for reliable closed-loop AO. We develop a novel training strategy for NNs that seeks to accommodate for changes in residual statistics between open and closed-loop, plus the addition of noise for robustness purposes. Through simulations, we test and compare several deep NNs, from classical to new convolutional neural networks (CNNs), plus a state-of-the-art transformer neural network (TNN, Global Context Visual Transformer, GCViT), first in open-loop and then in closed-loop. Using open-loop simulated data, we observe that a TNN (GCViT) largely surpasses any CNN in estimation accuracy in a wide range of turbulence conditions. Also, the TNN performs better in simulated closed-loop than CNNs, avoiding estimation issues at the pupil borders. When closing the loop at strong turbulence and low noise, the TNN using non-modulated PyWFS data is able to close the loop similar to a PyWFS with $12\lambda/D$ of modulation. When raising the noise only the TNN is able to close the loop, while the standard linear reconstructor fails, even with modulation. Using the GCViT, we close a real AO loop in the optical bench achieving a Strehl ratio between 0.28 and 0.77 for turbulence conditions ranging from 6cm to 20cm, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a TNN is the most suitable architecture to extend the dynamic range without sacrificing sensitivity for a non-modulated PyWFS. It opens the path for using non-modulated Pyramid WFSs under an unprecedented range of atmospheric and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Physics to System-level Modeling of Silicon-organic-hybrid Nanophotonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous growth in data volume has sparked interest in silicon-organic-hybrid nanophotonic devices integrated into silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). SOH devices offer improved speed and energy efficiency compared to silicon photonics devices. However, a comprehensive and accurate modeling methodology of SOH devices is lacking. While some preliminary modeling approaches for SOH devices exist, their reliance on theoretical and numerical methodologies, along with a lack of compatibility with electronic design automation (EDA), hinders their seamless and rapid integration with silicon PICs. Here, we develop a phenomenological, building-block-based SOH PICs simulation methodology spanning from the physics to the system level, offering high accuracy, comprehensiveness, and EDA-style compatibility. Our model is also readily integrable and scalable, lending itself to the design of large-scale silicon PICs. Our proposed modeling methodology is agnostic and compatible with any photonics-electronics co-simulation software. We validate this methodology by comparing experimentally demonstrated SOH microring modulators and Mach Zehnder modulators with those obtained through simulation, demonstrating its ability to model various modulator topologies. We also show our methodology's ease and speed in modeling large-scale systems. As an illustrative example, we use our methodology to design and study a 3-channel SOH MRM-based wavelength-division (de)multiplexer, a widely used component in various applications, including neuromorphic computing, data center interconnects, communications, and sensing. Our modeling approach is compatible with other materials exhibiting the Pockels and Kerr effects. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive physics-to-system-level EDA-compatible simulation methodology for SOH modulators.</description>

      <title>Knots of Darkness in Atmospheric Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology, which originated as a mathematical discipline, nowadays advances the understanding of many branches of science and technology from elementary particle physics and cosmology to condensed matter physics. In optics, the topology of light and darkness facilitates new degrees of freedom for sculpting optical beams beyond conventionally used amplitude, phase, and polarization. This fundamentally new, spatial dimension opens new opportunities for several optical applications, ranging from optical manipulation, trapping, data processing, optical sensing and metrology, enhanced imaging, and microscopy, to classical and quantum communications. While topological stability of mathematical knots implying robustness to perturbations suggests their potential as information carriers, the behavior of optical knots in perturbative environments such as atmospheric turbulence is largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence of optical knot stability and demonstrate that the number of crossing (the topological invariant) is preserved in the weak-turbulence regime, but may not be conserved in the stronger turbulence conditions. The turbulent medium is simulated in the laboratory using phase screens, which carry the refractive index changes associated with the Kolmogorov power spectrum, encoded in a spatial light modulator. The optical knots are reconstructed by single-shot measurements of the complex field, and the resilience of the knot topology is analyzed for various realistic turbulence strengths. These studies may give rise to entirely new approaches to the three-dimensional (3D) spatially resolved probing of turbulence.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present an experimental study supported by numerical modeling showing the possibility of exciting Symmetry-Protected Bound states In the Continuum (SP-BICs) in a 1D silicon grating fabricated on a lithium niobate substrate in both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization states of the incident illumination. This leads to different resonances in the transmission spectra with large quality factors up to $10^6$ and a significant electric/magnetic field enhancement up to $10^5$ opening the way to the exploitation of this structure for different sensing applications (biological, electromagnetic, thermal...) but also to nonlinear applications such as the generation of second harmonic, in addition to electro- and acousto-optic modulation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Spectral Phase Transfer in Four-Wave Mixing with Gas-filled Capillaries: A Trade-off Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-wave mixing (FWM) in gas-filled hollow-core capillaries, a nonlinear optical process that mixes signal and pump photon frequencies to generate idler frequency photons, offers a method for precise spectral phase transfer from signal to idler at ultrashort timescales and extreme powers. However, this regime is challenged by competing linear and nonlinear dynamics, leading to significant trade-offs between spectral phase transfer and conversion efficiency. Our computational investigation focuses on upconversion of femtosecond pulses from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV), a range notoriously difficult to manipulate. We explore an intermediate energy regime that strikes an optimal balance between FWM-mediated phase-transfer fidelity and nonlinear conversion efficiency. By adjusting the energy ratios and spectral phase profiles of the input signal, we achieve conversion efficiencies of approximately 5%-15% while maintaining an effectively quasi-linear spectral phase transfer. These findings contribute to establishing first-principles and scaling laws essential for applications such as high-precision imaging, spectroscopy, quantum transduction, and distributed entangled interconnects, facilitating advanced control of ultrafast photonic and electronic wavepackets in quantum materials with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision.</description>

      <title>Breaking and resurgence of symmetry in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in photonic waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the cornerstones of modern physics and has profound implications in different areas. In symmetry-protected topological systems, symmetries are responsible for protecting surface states, which are at the heart of the fascinating properties exhibited by these materials. When the symmetry protecting the edge mode is broken, the topological phase becomes trivial. By engineering losses that break the symmetry protecting a topological Hermitian phase, we show that a new genuinely non-Hermitian symmetry emerges, which protects and selects one of the boundary modes: the topological monomode. Moreover, the topology of the non-Hermitian system can be characterized by an effective Hermitian Hamiltonian in a higher dimension. To corroborate the theory, we experimentally investigated the non-Hermitian 1D and 2D SSH models using photonic lattices and observed dynamically generated monomodes in both cases. We classify the systems in terms of the (non-Hermitian) symmetries that are present and calculate the corresponding topological invariants.</description>

Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral properties have seen increasing use in recent years, leading to the emerging fields of chiral quantum optics, plasmonics, and phononics. While these fields have achieved manipulation of the chirality of light and lattice vibrations, controlling the chirality of materials on demand has yet remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that linearly polarized phonons can be used to induce geometric chirality in achiral crystals when excited with an ultrashort laser pulse. We show that nonlinear phonon coupling quasistatically displaces the crystal structure along phonon modes that reduce the symmetry of the lattice to that of a chiral point group corresponding to a chiral crystal. By reorienting the polarization of the laser pulse, the two enantiomers can be induced selectively. Therefore, geometric chiral phonons enable the light-induced creation of chiral crystal structures and offer a pathway to engineering chiral electronic states and optical properties.</description>

Abstract: We propose an optical analogue of electron snake states based on artificial gauge magnetic field in photonic graphene with effective strain implemented by varying distance between pillars. We develop an intuitive and exhaustive continuous model based on tight-binding approximation and compare it with numerical simulations of a realistic photonic structure. The allowed lateral propagation direction is shown to be strongly coupled to the valley degree of freedom and the proposed photonic structure may be used a valley filter.</description>

Abstract: Extending the scope of the self-imaging phenomenon, traditionally associated with linear optics, to the domain of magnonics, this study presents the experimental demonstration and numerical analysis of spin-wave (SW) self-imaging in an in-plane magnetized yttrium iron garnet film. We explore this phenomenon using a setup in which a plane SW passes through a diffraction grating, and the resulting interference pattern is detected using Brillouin light scattering. We have varied the frequencies of the source dynamic magnetic field to discern the influence of the anisotropic dispersion relation and the caustic effect on the analyzed phenomenon. We found that at low frequencies and diffraction fields, the caustics determine the interference pattern. However, at large distances from the grating, when the waves of high diffraction order and number of slits contribute to the interference pattern, the self-imaging phenomenon and Talbot-like patterns are formed. This methodological approach not only sheds light on the behavior of SW interference under different conditions but also enhances our understanding of the SW self-imaging process in both isotropic and anisotropic media.</description>
