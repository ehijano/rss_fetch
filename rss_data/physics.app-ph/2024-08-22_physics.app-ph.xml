      <title>Low Temperature Deposition of Functional Thin Films on Insulating Substrates: Selective Ion Acceleration using Synchronized Floating Potential HiPIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionized physical vapor deposition techniques, such as high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) are gaining popularity due to their ability to produce high-quality thin films at low deposition temperatures. In those techniques, ions are commonly accelerated onto the growing film using negative potential applied to the substrate. One key challenge however is, how such potentials can be applied on insulating or electrically floating substrates. In this work, we present a novel approach for low-temperature deposition of high-quality thin films on insulating substrates using Synchronized Floating Potential High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (SFP-HiPIMS). This technique leverages the negative floating potential, induced on the substrate during the HiPIMS discharge. By synchronizing the ion arrival with the substrate's floating potential, specific ions can be accelerated preferentially, thereby enhancing adatom mobility and improving film quality while mitigating the detrimental effects of Ar+ ion bombardment. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the deposition of high-quality, textured Al0.8Sc0.2N thin films on various insulating substrates at low temperatures. We show that synchronizing the Al and Sc ion fluxes with the induced negative floating potential significantly enhances the films' crystallinity, c-axis texture and at the same time reduces residual stress. In addition, it enables epitaxial growth on sapphire at temperatures as low as 100{\deg}C. The results of this study demonstrate that SFP-HiPIMS provides a practical and economical solution for a long-standing challenge in physical vapor deposition, which can be implemented in standard deposition equipment. SFP-HiPIMS therefore paves the way for advanced manufacturing processes in various emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Doping-free Janus homojunction solar cell with efficiency exceeding 23%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic solar cell is one of the main renewable energy sources, and its power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved by employing doping or heterojunction to reduce the photogenerated carrier recombination. Here, we propose a doping-free homojunction solar cell utilizing two-dimensional Janus semiconductors to achieve high PCE. Thanks to the intrinsic dipole of Janus structure, doping-free Janus homojunction has naturally not only a type-II band alignment to promote the photoexciton dissociation, but also a smaller effective bandgap to enhance light absorption. More importantly, the intrinsic electric field across the Janus structure will drive photoinduced electron and hole transfer from the interface to the opposite transport layers respectively, significantly enhancing the efficiency of carrier separation and transport. We illustrate the concept in titanium-based Janus monolayer homojunction, where the theoretically observed PCE reaches 23.22% of TiSSe homojunction. Our work opens a novel avenue to design low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate for the "sound" wave the coefficient of reflection from (the coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds and the wave impedances. When only the capacitors or only the inductors are nonlinear, the coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds only. We explicitly include into consideration of the shocks the dissipation, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Improved precision and accuracy of electron energy-loss spectroscopy quantification via fine structure fitting with constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By working out the Bethe sum rule, a boundary condition that takes the form of a linear equality is derived for the fine structure observed in ionization edges present in electron energy-loss spectra. This condition is subsequently used as a constraint in the estimation process of the elemental abundances, demonstrating starkly improved precision and accuracy and reduced sensitivity to the number of model parameters. Furthermore, the fine structure is reliably extracted from the spectra in an automated way, thus providing critical information on the sample's electronic properties that is hard or impossible to obtain otherwise. Since this approach allows dispensing with the need for user-provided input, a potential source of bias is prevented.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupling for Optical Vortex Generation in van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optical vortex beam has attracted significant attention across diverse applications, including optical manipulation, phase-contrast microscopy, optical communication, and quantum photonics. To utilize vortex generators for integrated photonics, researchers have developed ultra-compact vortex generators using fork gratings, metasurfaces, and integrated microcombs. However, those devices depend on costly, time-consuming nanofabrication and are constrained by the low signal-to-noise ratio due to the fabrication error. As an alternative maneuver, spin-orbit coupling has emerged as a method to obtain the vortex beam by converting spin angular momentum (SAM) without nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an optical vortex beam using van der Waals (vdW) materials. The significantly high birefringence of vdW materials allows generations of optical vortex beams with high efficiency in a sub-wavelength thickness. In this work, we utilize an 8-um-thick hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal for the creation of optical vortices carrying topological charges of +2 and -2. We also present the generation of an optical vortex beam in a 320-nm-thick MoS2 crystal with a conversion efficiency of 0.09. This study paves the way for fabrication-less and ultra-compact optical vortex generators, which can be applied for integrated photonics and large-scale vortex generator arrays.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Layer-Spintronics in Altermagnetic Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current is highly desirable yet tremendously challenging in developing ultracompact spintronic device technology. Here we propose a scheme to realize the all-electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current in an altermagnetic bilayer. Such a bilayer system can host layer-spin locking, in which one layer hosts a spin-polarized current while the other layer hosts a current with opposite spin polarization. An out-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a gate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed upon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange interaction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the spin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via the layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin polarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature. This work presents the pioneering concept of layer-spintronics which synergizes altermagnetism and bilayer stacking to achieve efficient electrical control of spin.</description>

      <title>Inherent negative-illumination photocurrent of infrared diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negative-illumination photovoltaic effect has been investigated for an alternative energy harvesting system converting thermal radiation from the Earth surface to the cold outer space. We investigate maximum power generation ability of two narrow gap p-n junction diodes with the bandgap energy of 0.12 eV and 0.26 eV when the diodes are faced to a sufficiently cooled surface. While the atmospheric absorption can be neglected, each diode generates inherent negative-illumination photocurrent, which depends on only temperature of the diode. We find that the inherent photocurrent of the diode with smaller bandgap is larger but is suppressed by increasing of temperature. We also show the external quantum efficiency of the negative-illumination effect indicates a maximum and becomes smaller as temperature increases. The suppression of the photocurrent and the external quantum efficiency are possible to be originated from enhancement of the Auger recombination process at high temperatures. Our results will help for design optimization of semiconductor devices to generate electrical power from the terrestrial radiation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Transparent Electrodes: Interplay of High Purity SWCNTs network and a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of transparent electrodes led to the development of optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, LCDs, touchscreens, IR sensors, etc. Since ITO has many drawbacks in respect of its production cost and limited transparency in IR, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been a potential replacement for ITO due to their exceptional electrical and optical properties, especially in the IR region. In this work, we present the development of a CNT-polymer composite thin film that exhibits outstanding transparency across both visible and IR spectra prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. This approach not only ensures uniform integration and crosslinking of CNTs into lightweight matrices, but also represents a cost-effective method for producing transparent electrodes with remarkable optical and electrical properties. The produced films achieved a transparency above 80% in the UV-VIS range and approximately 70% in the mid-IR range. The sheet resistance of the fabricated thin films was measured at about 4 kOhm/sq, showing a tendency to decrease with the number of bilayers. Furthermore, in this work we have investigated electrical properties and transport mechanisms in more detail with computational analysis. Computational analysis was performed to better understand the electrical behavior of nanotube-polymer junctions in the interbundle structure. Based on all results, we propose that the transparent electrodes with 4 and 6 bilayers are the most optimal structures in terms of optical and electrical properties.</description>

      <title>High-performance multiqubit system with double-transmon couplers: Toward scalable superconducting quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunable couplers in superconducting quantum computers have enabled fast and accurate two-qubit gates, with reported high fidelities over 99% in various architectures and gate implementation schemes. However, there are few tunable couplers whose performance in multi-qubit systems is clarified, except for the most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly detuned and also next nearest-neighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. We find that the DTC can not only reduce undesired residual couplings sufficiently, as well as in isolated two-qubits systems, but also enables implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and individual and simultaneous 10-ns $\pi/2$ pulses with fidelities over 99.99%. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable inverse designed phase-change photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a promising approach to programmable photonics thanks to their nonvolatile, reversible phase transitions and high refractive index contrast. However, conventional designs are limited by global phase control over entire PCM thin films between fully amorphous and fully crystalline states, which restricts device functionality and confines design flexibility and programmability. In this work, we present a novel approach that leverages pixel-level control of PCM in inverse-designed photonic devices, enabling highly reconfigurable, multi-functional operations. We integrate low-loss Sb2Se3 onto a multi-mode interferometer (MMI) and achieve precise, localized phase manipulation through direct laser writing. This technique allows for flexible programming of the photonic device by adjusting the PCM phase pattern rather than relying on global phase states, thereby enhancing device adaptability. As a proof of concept, we programmed the device as a wavelength-division multiplexer and subsequently reconfigured it into a mode-division multiplexer. Our results underscore the potential of combining inverse design with pixel-wise tuning for next-generation programmable phase-change photonic systems.</description>
