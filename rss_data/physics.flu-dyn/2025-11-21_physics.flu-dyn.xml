      <title>Process Microstructure Coupling in Reduced Gravity Laser Welding via Open-Source Multiphysics Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supplying spare parts from Earth for in space repair is economically prohibitive and logistically slow, posing a major barrier to sustainable space operations. As lunar and Martian missions accelerate in the coming decades, the feasibility of in-situ repair methods, particularly laser based welding, must be rigorously evaluated. The micro scale physics governing weld quality are fundamentally altered by variations in gravity and ambient pressure, yet their coupled influence across different welding regimes remains poorly understood. This work introduces a fully open-source thermo-fluid-microstructure modeling framework with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and cellular automata (CA) to quantify how gravitational conditions reshape weld pool behavior across multiple welding regimes and spatial scales. The framework further enables prediction of the resulting microstructure from imposed process parameters, providing an accessible pathway for future research in in space manufacturing (ISM). As a demonstration, the article analyzes laser welding of Al6061 across three process regimes (conduction, transition, and keyhole) and four gravitational environments (Earth, Moon, Mars, and International Space Station (ISS)). Analysis reveals that reduced gravity suppresses buoyancy-driven convection, thereby altering melt pool geometries. Vacuum conditions increase laser energy deposition, while microgravity promotes equiaxed grain formation via reduced melt convection. The framework captures keyhole dynamics, thermal histories, and grain morphologies with high fidelity, validated against experimental data. These findings establish process microstructure relationships critical for reliable metallic fabrication in space and provide a reproducible platform for future in-space manufacturing research.</description>

      <title>Micro-Macro Simulation of Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow flows are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. They are commonly modelled using the shallow water equations, a great simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations, which often yields inaccurate results. For that reason, a model called shallow water moment equations has been developed. It uses more equations and variables than the shallow water equations. While this model is significantly more accurate, it is also computationally more expensive. To speed up computations, the micro-macro method may be used. The micro-macro method switches between two models of varying levels of detail allowing for larger stable time steps. In this paper we formulate the micro-macro method for shallow water moment equations. We perform a theoretical runtime analysis of the method and present a series of results for a dam break test and a wave transport test. The micro-macro method achieves a significant speed-up while retaining a sufficient level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>A new instability driven by the combined effect of wind stress and rotation in a sheared liquid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the linear stability of a shear flow driven by wind stress at the free surface and rotation at the lower boundary, mimicking oceanic flows influenced by surface winds and rotation of Earth. The linearised eigenvalue problem is solved using the Chebyshev spectral collocation method and a longwave asymptotic analysis. Our results reveal new longwave instability modes that emerge for non-zero rotational Reynolds numbers. It is observed that the most unstable mode, characterised by the lowest critical parameters, corresponds to longwave spanwise disturbances with vanishing streamwise wavenumber. The asymptotic analysis, which shows excellent agreement with numerical results, analytically confirms the existence of this instability. Thus, the present study demonstrates the hitherto unreported combined influence of wind stress and rotation of Earth on ocean dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling the influence of interactions on different variables in a turbulent thermoacoustic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent reacting flows confined to ducts are plagued by thermoacoustic instability, a state in which a positive feedback between flow, flame and acoustic perturbations leads to the emergence of catastrophically high-amplitude oscillatory dynamics in the sound and global heat release rate fluctuations. Modeling the interdependence between local interactions and the global emergence of order in such spatially extended complex systems is exacting. Here, we present a novel reduced-order model to capture the influence of the local interactions on the variables exhibiting global emergence of order in a turbulent reacting flow system. We represent each variable that exhibits global oscillatory instability as an oscillator with a cubic nonlinearity. The oscillator is driven by a forcing term that represents the holistic influence of the inter-subsystem interactions on the global behavior. The forcing term essentially couples the local interactions and the globally emergent dynamics in the model. Further, the influence of the inter-subsystem interactions on the behavior of each subsystem is different. Therefore, we use different forcing terms for each variable inspired by the physical interactions in the system. The nonlinear oscillators representing the acoustic and the heat release rate oscillations are hence forced using Wiener and Markov-modulated Poisson processes, respectively. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce (i) the multifractal characteristics of acoustic pressure fluctuations during chaotic dynamics, (ii) the loss of multifractality through the experimentally observed scaling law behavior during the transition from chaos to order and (iii) the emergence of periodicity and bifurcation in heat release rate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards Streaming Prediction of Oscillatory Flows: A Data Assimilation and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities in fluid mechanics, yet most current applications still focus on simplified configurations, often characterised by statistical stationarity or limited temporal variability. This work proposes a methodology that combines Data Assimilation (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict flow configurations that exhibit cyclic behaviour over time. Starting from limited, sparse high-fidelity measurements and a low-fidelity numerical model, the DA approach performs data fusion to obtain complete and accurate flow state estimations in time. This complete dataset is used to train multiple ML tools, which are applied across different phases of the flow cycle to augment the model's predictions when high-fidelity data might not be available for the DA application. The methodology is applied to the analysis of an oscillating cylinder in a laminar regime using a sliding-window approach, in which separate models are trained for specific flow conditions to ensure each model specialises in flow dynamics representative of a phase of the oscillation period. This phase-resolved learning enables the efficient capture of transient features that would be challenging for a single global model. The results highlight the potential of this method to study complex flow configurations with oscillatory features in which neither the flow nor the cycle is known a priori, in particular by exploiting real-time training and updates, as is commonly done in digital twins, which require continuous model correction and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Periodic modulation of the space-filling nature of the turbulent flame leads to spiky heat release oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiky oscillations are characterized by slow-fast dynamics and are observed in excitable media such as neuronal membranes and cardiac cells. In a turbulent reactive flow system, we observe that the heat release rate exhibits self-sustained periodic, spiky oscillations in synchrony with the sinusoidal periodic acoustic pressure oscillations. These self-sustained oscillations are a consequence of thermoacoustic instability, which arises due to a positive feedback between the acoustic and the heat release rate fields. One of the primary mechanisms for fluctuations in the heat release rate is the modulation in the topology of the flame, a thin interface separating the reactants and products. In this work, we explore the dynamics of the space-filling nature of the flame, quantified by its fractal dimension in relation to the spiky heat release rate oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system. We discover that the periodic oscillatory dynamics in the space-filling nature of the flame lead to periodic, spiky heat release rate oscillations. Based on this result, we show that the spiky oscillations in the heat release rate can be approximated as $e^{\mathrm{sin}(\omega t)}$ during the dynamical state of generalized synchronization between the heat release rate and the acoustic pressure oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system. In synchronization theory, generalized synchronization is characterized by an emergent functional relationship, $\Phi$, between the interacting subsystems. We unravel this emergent functional relation between the heat release rate and the acoustic pressure oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system. It is intriguing that the dynamics of a far-from-equilibrium complex system can be represented by such simple mathematical relations.</description>

      <title>Consistency requirement of data-driven subgrid-scale modeling in large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling in the large-eddy simulations (LES) suffers from the inconsistency between the \textit{a priori} tests and the a posteriori tests, which make training accurate SGS models a difficult task. We study the difference in filtered high-fidelity data and LES to identify the numerical deviation between the two cases, which is a combined impact of commutation error, numerical errors, and error coupling. The impact of the numerical deviation is examined through two SGS model formulations: the eddy-viscosity and the complex nonlinear models. By incorporating numerical deviations into model training, we enhance consistency, stabilize simulations, and improve predictions of energy spectra in a posteriori tests. Our findings highlight that data-driven methods introduce significant nonlinearity and equation coupling, exacerbating inconsistencies compared to non-data-driven approaches. Finally, while the impact of the numerical deviation can be generalized, achieving accurate model predictions necessitates a physically grounded model form and an optimal filter width.</description>

      <title>An Objective $Q$-Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Eulerian vortex criteria, such as the $Q$-, $\Delta$-, $\lambda_2$-, $\lambda_{ci}$-, and Okubo--Weiss criterion, depend on frame-dependent quantities and therefore fail to provide objective, observer-independent diagnostics in unsteady frames. In this work, we address this longstanding limitation by introducing an objective variant of the $Q$-criterion, derived from a spatio-temporal variational principle that minimizes a modified time-derivative of the strain-rate tensor. Although several objective variants of the $Q$-criterion have been proposed before, none of these has successfully reconciled Eulerian diagnostics with the underlying Lagrangian motion of fluid particles, even in simple analytical solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we present the first vortex criterion that consistently resolves all known pathological examples leading to false positives and false negatives in Eulerian vortex criteria applied to unsteady flows. The results establish a unified and objective framework for Eulerian vortex detection, opening new directions for the analysis and control of unsteady flow phenomena.</description>

      <title>Local and global bifurcations to large-scale oblique patterns in inclined layer convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the inclined layer convection system, thermal convection in a Rayleigh--B\'enard cell tilted against gravity, the flow is subject to competing buoyancy and shear forces. For varying inclination angle ($\gamma$) and Rayleigh number ($Ra$), a variety of spatio-temporal patterns is observed. We investigate the switching diamond panes (SDP) pattern, observed at $(\gamma, Ra)\simeq(100\degree,10000)$, which exhibits large-scale oblique features and is one of the five complex tertiary patterns at Prandtl number $Pr=1.07$. First, we study the linear instability of the secondary-state transverse convection rolls and the five branches including two travelling waves and three periodic orbits, bifurcating simultaneously from it. These non-generic bifurcations arise from the breaking of the spatial $D_4$ and $O(2)$ symmetries of transverse rolls, and the resulting bifurcated solutions show large-scale diamond-shaped amplitude modulations. Second, we explore a periodic orbit that captures both the large-scale structure and small-scale defects of modulated rolls. Parametric continuation in $Ra$ reveals the global homoclinic bifurcation via which this periodic orbit emerges. Third, the boundary of the basins of attraction of two dynamically relevant periodic orbits has been characterised. Specifically, additional steady and time-periodic solutions are identified on the basin boundary and their bifurcation structures are analysed. Together, using non-linear invariant solutions and their bifurcations, we take a further step toward understanding the emergence and dynamics of SDP far from the onset of convection, where linear methods have not been applied successfully.</description>

      <title>From nature to engineering: Bio-inspired spacer solutions for membrane distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomimetic design principles, inspired by the structure of alligator osteoderms, are employed to provide innovative solutions for enhancing membrane distillation system performance. A novel spacer design for membrane distillation (MD) systems is introduced, incorporating the unique structural features of these natural formations. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to investigate nine new spacer configurations, with particular emphasis placed on enhancing mixing efficiency within the feed channel, which serves as the primary focus of this research. Results demonstrate that the novel spacer configurations exhibit superior performance, achieving up to a fivefold increase in mixing efficiency relative to the baseline of an empty channel. Furthermore, the new spacers are assessed and contrasted with two types of conventional spacers and the empty channel configuration with respect to pressure drop, thermal performance, and mass transfer properties.</description>

      <title>Fourth branch of instability of Stokes' wave and dependence of corresponding growth rate on nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a massive computation we reached the fourth superharmonic instability branch of the Stokes' wave. Using the obtained results we checked phenomenological formulae for the dependence of the instability growth rates corresponding to different branches of instability on the nonlinearity parameter (steepness, defined as the wave swing to wavelength ratio $H/\Lambda$) in the vicinity of the new instability branch appearance and far from it. It is demonstrated, that the formulae, the one obtained as a least squares fit using the information from the first three branches of instability and a phenomenological asymptotics, work for the fourth branch and previously reported branches as well. Range of applicability of the relations was corrected. Growth rates for all four instability branches are reported.</description>

      <title>General-purpose Data-driven Wall Model for Low-speed Flows Part I: Baseline Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general-purpose wall model for large-eddy simulation. The model builds on the building-block flow principle, leveraging essential physics from simple flows to train a generalizable model applicable across complex geometries and flow conditions. The model addresses key limitations of traditional equilibrium wall models (EQWM) and improves upon shortcomings of earlier building-block-based approaches. The model comprises four components: (i) a baseline wall model, (ii) an error model, (iii) a classifier, and (iv) a confidence score. The baseline model predicts the wall-shear stress, while the error model estimates epistemic errors and aleatoric errors, both used for uncertainty quantification. In Part I of this work, we present the baseline model, while the remaining three components are introduced in Part II. The baseline model is designed to capture a broad range of flow phenomena, including turbulence over curved walls and zero, adverse, and favorable mean pressure gradients, as well as flow separation and laminar flow. The problem is formulated as a regression task to predict wall shear stress using a neural network. Model inputs are localized in space and dimensionless, with their selection guided by information-theoretic criteria. Training data include, among other cases, a newly generated direct numerical simulation dataset of turbulent boundary layers under favorable and adverse PG conditions. Validation is carried out through both a priori and a posteriori tests. The a priori evaluation spans 140 diverse high-fidelity numerical datasets and experiments (67 training cases included), covering turbulent boundary layers, airfoils, Gaussian bumps, and full aircraft geometries, among others. We demonstrate that the baseline wall model outperforms the EQWM in 90% of test scenarios, while maintaining errors below 20% for 98% of the cases.</description>

      <title>GLOBE: Accurate and Generalizable PDE Surrogates using Domain-Inspired Architectures and Equivariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).</description>

      <title>Excitation of Inertial Modes in 3D Simulations of Rotating Convection in Planets and Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal convection in rotating stars and planets drives anisotropic turbulence and strong differential rotation, both capable of feeding energy into global oscillations. Using 3D simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells, we show that inertial modes--oscillations restored by the Coriolis force--emerge naturally in rotationally constrained turbulence, without imposing any external forcing. By varying the rotation rate at fixed thermal forcing, we find that coherent modes appear only when the convective Rossby number, the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time, falls below about one-half, where rotation dominates the dynamics. These modes are mostly retrograde in the rotating frame, equatorially symmetric, and confined to mid and high latitudes, with discrete frequencies well below twice the rotation rate. At lower viscosities, or smaller Prandtl number, mode excitation becomes more efficient and a broader spectrum of inertial modes emerges. While the precise excitation mechanism remains uncertain, our results suggest that the modes are driven by shear instabilities rather than stochastic forcing by convection. We conclude that similar inertial modes are likely to exist in the interiors of giant planets and stars, though their low frequencies will make them difficult to detect.</description>

      <title>Do irrotational water waves remain irrotational in the limit of a vanishing viscosity?</title>

Abstract: Theoretical results on water waves almost always start by assuming irrotationality of the flow in order to simplify the formulation. In this work, we investigate the well-foundedness of this hypothesis via numerical simulations of the free-surface Navier-Stokes equations.
  We show that, in the presence of a non-flat bathymetry, either angular or smooth, a gravity wave of finite amplitude can shed vortex pairs from the bottom boundary layer into the bulk of the flow. As these eddies approach the free surface they modify the shape of the wave. It is found that this perturbation does not vanish as the Reynolds number is increased. The vanishing viscosity limit of water waves is therefore singular when no-slip boundary conditions are enforced on the bottom.</description>

      <title>Inverse energy transfer in three-dimensional quantum vortex flows</title>

Abstract: Vortex reconnections play a fundamental role in fluids.They increase the complexity of flow and develop small-scale motions.In this work, we report that in superfluids, they can also excite large scales. We numerically illustrate that during a superfluid vortex reconnection energy is injected into the thermal (normal) component of helium~II at small length scales, but is transferred nonlinearly to larger length scales, increasing the integral length scale of the normal fluid. We show, by studying about fifty different reconnections, that this inverse energy transfer is triggered by the helical imbalance generated in the normal fluid flow by the mutual friction force coupling the superfluid vortices and the normal component. We finally discuss the relevance of our findings to the problem of superfluid turbulence.</description>

      <title>Tracking the rotation of light magnetic particles in turbulence</title>

Abstract: Particle-laden turbulence involves complex interactions between the dispersed and continuous phases. Given that particles can exhibit a wide range of properties, such as varying density, size, and shape, their interplay with the flow can lead to various modifications of the turbulence. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of particles is a necessary first step toward revealing the behavior of the multiphase system. Within the context of particle dynamics, accurately resolving rotational motion presents a significantly greater challenge compared to translational motion. We propose an experimental method to track the rotational motion of spherical, light, and magnetic particles with sizes significantly smaller than the Taylor microscale, typically an order of magnitude larger than the Kolmogorov scale of the turbulence in which they are suspended. The method fully resolves all three components of the particle angular velocity using only 2D images acquired from a single camera. This technique enables a detailed investigation of the rotational dynamics of magnetic particles subjected simultaneously to small-scale turbulent structures and external magnetic forcing. Beyond advancing the study of particle dynamics in turbulence, this approach opens new possibilities for actively modulating turbulence through externally applied magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Train yourself: self-compressing reduced-order models of turbulent flows</title>

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) of turbulent flows based on Galerkin projection often require many degrees of freedom to resolve the dynamics of the turbulence, or simulation data to obtain an optimal modal basis. However, obtaining simulation data is computationally expensive, and the amount of data required to obtain a converged modal basis can increase this cost. Using the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, one can achieve spatial modes through the controllability and observability Gramians, which can yield a ROM without prior simulation data. In this work, we propose a self-compression of a ROM based on controllability modes, where the time series of the modal coefficients are leveraged to reduce the dimension of the ROM. In the self-compressed ROM (SCROM), we can maintain accurate first- and second-order statistics with respect to the DNS simulation, but in a further reduced dimension. The SCROM recovers spatial structures equivalent to proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) without relying on any simulation data, recombining spatial modes from linearized equations. This method leads to a novel ROM that can represent turbulence statistics in a data-free approach in a further reduced state space.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional model for axisymmetric deformations of an inflated hyperelastic tube of finite wall thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a one-dimensional (1d) model for the analysis of bulging or necking in an inflated hyperelastic tube of {\it finite wall thickness} from the three-dimensional finite elasticity theory by applying the dimension reduction methodology proposed by Audoly and Hutchinson (J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 97, 2016). The 1d model makes it much easier to characterize fully nonlinear axisymmetric deformations of a thick-walled tube using simple numerical schemes such as the finite difference method. The new model recovers the diffuse interface model for analyzing bulging in a membrane tube and the 1d model for investigating necking in a stretched solid cylinder as two limiting cases. It is consistent with, but significantly refines, the exact linear and weakly nonlinear bifurcation analyses. Comparisons with finite element simulations show that for the bulging problem, the 1d model is capable of describing the entire bulging process accurately, from initiation, growth, to propagation. The 1d model provides a stepping stone from which similar 1d models can be derived and used to study other effects such as anisotropy and electric loading, and other phenomena such as rupture.</description>
