      <title>Deep and low mass-ratio contact binaries and their third bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep and low mass-ratio contact binaries (DLMCBs) are believed to be in the final stage of their contact phase, potentially leading to the formation of fast-rotating single stars such as FK Com-type stars and blue stragglers, as well as luminous red novae. These systems serve as an excellent laboratory for studying stellar coalescence and merging processes. Our search for DLMCBs began in 2004 and has since identified a group of such systems. Together with that collected from the literature, more than 100 DLMCBs have been detected so far. Half of them have had their periods investigated based on O-C curves. Some have shown period increases, while others have exhibited period decreases. Among them, more than half DLMCBs have cyclic variations, suggesting the possibility of the existence of a third body orbiting around the DLMCBs. Furthermore, with more data obtained extending the span of the O-C curve, more cyclic variations could be detected. The high proportion of signs of the presence of third bodies makes them an essential factor to consider when studying the merger of contact binaries.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Relationship Between Rocky Exoplanet and Stellar Compositions: Reduced Evidence for a Super-Mercury Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets and the stars they orbit are born from the same cloud of gas and dust, and the primordial compositions of rocky exoplanets have been assumed to have iron and refractory abundance ratios consistent with their host star. To test this assumption, we modeled the interior iron-to-rock ratio of 20 super-Earth sized (1-1.8R$_{\oplus}$) exoplanets around stars with homogeneously measured stellar parameters. We computed the core mass fraction for each planet and an equivalent ``core mass fraction'' for each host star based on its Fe and Mg abundances. We then fit a linear correlation using two methods (Ordinary Least Squares and Orthogonal Distance Regression) between planetary and stellar core mass fraction, obtaining substantially different slopes between these two methods (m=1.3 $\pm$ 1.0 and m=5.6 $\pm$ 1.6, respectively). Additionally, we find that 75$\%$ of planets have a core mass fraction consistent with their host star to within 1$\sigma$, and do not identify a distinct population of high-density super-Mercuries. Overall, we conclude that current uncertainties in observational data and differences in modeling methods prevent definitive conclusions about the relationship between between planet and host star chemical compositions.</description>

      <title>3D Radiation-Hydrodynamical Simulations of Shadows on Transition Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shadows are often observed in transition disks, which can result from obscuring by materials closer to the star, such as a misaligned inner disk. While shadows leave apparent darkened emission as observational signatures, they have significant dynamical impact on the disk. We carry out 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to study shadows in transition disks and find that the temperature drop due to the shadow acts as an asymmetric driving force, leading to spirals in the cavity. These spirals have zero pattern speed following the fixed shadow. The pitch angle is given by tan$^{-1}$($c_s$/$v_\phi$) (6$^{\circ}$ if $h/r$=0.1). These spirals transport mass through the cavity efficiently, with $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$ in our simulation. Besides spirals, the cavity edge can also form vortices and flocculent streamers. When present, these features could disturb the shadow-induced spirals. By carrying out Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations, we show that these features resemble those observed in near-infrared scattered light images. In the vertical direction, the vertical gravity is no longer balanced by the pressure gradient alone. Instead, an azimuthal convective acceleration term balances the gravity-pressure difference, leading to azimuthally periodic upward and downward gas motion reaching 10% of the sound speed, which can be probed by ALMA line observations.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Systematic Transient Search of Single Observation Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for astrophysical transients using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The data were taken from 2017 to 2022 in three frequency bands spanning 77 GHz to 277 GHz. In this paper we present a pipeline for transient detection using single observation maps where each pixel of a map contains one observation with an integration time of approximately four minutes. We find 34 transient events at 27 unique locations. All but two of the transients are associated with Galactic stars and exhibit a wide range of properties. We also detect an event coincident with the classical nova, YZ Ret and one event consistent with a flaring active galactic nucleus. We notably do not detect any reverse shock emission from gamma ray bursts, a non-detection which is in tension with current models.</description>

      <title>GRAVITY+ Wavefront Sensors: High-Contrast, Laser Guide Star, Adaptive Optics systems for the VLTI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Wavefront Sensor units of the Gravity Plus Adaptive Optics (GPAO) system, which will equip all 8m class telescopes of the VLTI and is an instrumental part of the GRAVITY+ project. It includes two modules for each Wavefront Sensor unit: a Natural Guide Star sensor with high-order 40x40 Shack-Hartmann and a Laser Guide Star 30x30 sensor. The state-of-the-art AO correction will considerably improve the performance for interferometry, in particular high-contrast observations for NGS observations and all-sky coverage with LGS, which will be implemented for the first time on VLTI instruments. In the following, we give an overview of the Wavefront Sensor units system after completion of their integration and characterization.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Sequence of Phases Leading to the Formation of the Active Region 13664, with Potential Carrington-like Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recurrent X-class flares from Active Region (AR) 13664 have triggered a severe G5-class geomagnetic storm between May 10 and 11, 2024. The morphology and compactness of this AR closely resemble the active region responsible for the famous Carrington Event of 1859. Although the induced geomagnetic currents produced a value of the Dst index, probably, an order of magnitude weaker than that of the Carrington Event, the characteristics of AR 13664 warrant special attention. Understanding the mechanisms of magnetic field emergence and transformation in the solar atmosphere that lead to the formation of such an extensive, compact and complex AR is crucial. Our analysis of the emerging flux and horizontal motions of the magnetic structures observed in the photosphere reveals the fundamental role of a sequence of emerging bipoles at the same latitude and longitude, followed by converging and shear motions. This temporal order of processes frequently invoked in magnetohydrodynamic models - emergence, converging motions, and shear motions - is critical for the storage of magnetic energy preceding strong solar eruptions that, under the right timing, location and direction conditions, can trigger severe space weather events at Earth.</description>

      <title>One month convection timescale on the surface of a giant evolved star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of energy through convection is important during many stages of stellar evolution, and is best studied in our Sun or giant evolved stars. Features that are attributed to convection are found on the surface of massive red supergiant stars. Also for lower mass evolved stars, indications of convection are found, but convective timescales and sizes remain poorly constrained. Models indicate that convective motions are crucial for the production of strong winds that return the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium. Here we report a series of reconstructed interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star R Doradus. The images reveal a stellar disc with prominent small scale features that provide the structure and motions of convection on the stellar surface. We find that the dominant structure size of the features on the stellar disc is $0.72\pm0.05$ astronomical units (au). We measure the velocity of the surface motions to vary between $-18$ and $+20$ km s$^{-1}$, which means the convective timescale is approximately one month. This indicates a possible difference between the convection properties of low-mass and high-mass evolved stars.</description>

      <title>A New Parameterization for Finding Solutions for Microlensing Exoplanet Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational microlensing method of discovering exoplanets and multi-star systems can produce degenerate solutions, some of which require in-depth analysis to uncover. We propose a new parameter space that can be used to sample potential solutions more efficiently and is more robust at finding all degenerate solutions. We identified two new parameters, k and h, that can be sampled in place of the mass ratios and separations of the systems under analysis to identify degenerate solutions. The parameter k is related to the size of the central caustic, $\Delta\xi_c$, while h is related to the distance of a point along the k contour from log(s)=0, where s is the projected planet-host separation. In this work, we present the characteristics of these parameters and the tests we conducted to prove their efficacy.</description>

      <title>Solar chameleons: Novel channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flux of chameleons (light scalar particles which could play a role in the dark energy phenomenon) produced in the interior of the Sun. Our novel analysis incorporates various important details and new processes that have previously been overlooked, including the impact of the bulk magnetic field profile, as well as Primakoff production of chameleons in the electric fields of electrons and ions. In this paper we consider only the contributions of transverse photons. The production of chameleons from longitudinal electromagnetic excitations will be presented in a dedicated follow-up work. Demanding that the total flux of chameleons does not exceed 3% of the solar luminosity leads to the stringent upper limit on the chameleon-photon conformal coupling $\beta_\gamma \lesssim 10^{10}$, assuming that the height of the chameleon potential is set to the dark energy scale $\Lambda = 2.4$ meV, and independently of other couplings to matter. Although this bound is tighter than current upper limits on $\beta_{\gamma}$ from the CAST helioscope, these limits will have to be reassessed in terms of the updated solar chameleon flux we have computed. We argue that solar chameleons, potentially detectable in next-generation helioscopes such as IAXO, can be used to probe a region of chameleon parameter space that has yet to be covered.</description>

      <title>First Indication of Solar $^8$B Neutrino Flux through Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T liquid xenon detector at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory is used to measure the solar $^8$B neutrino flux by detecting neutrinos through coherent scattering with xenon nuclei. Data samples requiring the coincidence of scintillation and ionization signals (paired), as well as unpaired ionization-only signals (US2), are selected with energy threshold of approximately 1.1 keV (0.33 keV) nuclear recoil energy. Combining the commissioning run and the first science run of PandaX-4T, a total exposure of 1.20 and 1.04 tonne$\cdot$year are collected for the paired and US2, respectively. After unblinding, 3 and 332 events are observed with an expectation of 2.8$\pm$0.5 and 251$\pm$32 background events, for the paired and US2 data, respectively. A combined analysis yields a best-fit $^8$B neutrino signal of 3.5 (75) events from the paired (US2) data sample, with $\sim$37\% uncertainty, and the background-only hypothesis is disfavored at 2.64$\sigma$ significance. This gives a solar $^8$B neutrino flux of ($8.4\pm3.1$)$\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, consistent with the standard solar model prediction. It is also the first indication of solar $^8$B neutrino ``fog'' in a dark matter direct detection experiment.</description>
