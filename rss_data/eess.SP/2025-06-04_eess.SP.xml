      <title>Sums of Mixed Independent Positive Random Variables: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive and unprecedented framework that streamlines the derivation of exact, compact -- yet tractable -- solutions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the sum of a broad spectrum of mixed independent positive random variables (RVs). To showcase the framework's potential and extensive applicability, we tackle the enduring challenge of obtaining these statistics for the sum of fading variates in an exact, manageable, and unified manner. Specifically, we derive novel, tractable expressions for the PDF and CDF of the sum of Gaussian-class and non-Gaussian-class fading distributions, thereby covering a plethora of conventional, generalized, and recently introduced fading models. The proposed framework accommodates independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sums, independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) sums, and mixed-type sums. Moreover, we introduce the strikingly novel $\alpha$-$\mu$ mixture distribution that unifies all Gaussian-class fading models.</description>

      <title>Baseband-Free End-to-End Communication System Based on Diffractive Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), also referred to as reconfigurable intelligent metasurface based deep neural networks (Rb-DNNs) or stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) in the field of wireless communications, has emerged as a promising signal processing paradigm that enables computing-by-propagation. However, existing architectures are limited to implementing specific functions such as precoding and combining, while still relying on digital baseband modules for other essential tasks like modulation and detection. In this work, we propose a baseband-free end-to-end (BBF-E2E) wireless communication system where modulation, beamforming, and detection are jointly realized through the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves. The BBF-E2E system employs D2NNs at both the transmitter and the receiver, forming an autoencoder architecture optimized as a complex-valued neural network. The transmission coefficients of each metasurface layer are trained using the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method to minimize the cross-entropy loss. To reduce computational complexity during diffraction calculation, the angular spectrum method (ASM) is adopted in place of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formula. Extensive simulations demonstrate that BBF-E2E achieves robust symbol transmission under challenging channel conditions with significantly reduced hardware requirements. In particular, the proposed system matches the performance of a conventional multi-antenna system with 81 RF chains while requiring only a single RF chain and 1024 passive elements of metasurfaces. These results highlight the potential of wave-domain neural computing to replace digital baseband modules in future wireless transceivers.</description>

      <title>Passive Multi-Target Visible Light Positioning Based on Multi-Camera Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera-based visible light positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising indoor positioning technique. However, the need for dedicated LED infrastructure and on-target cameras in existing algorithms limits their scalability and increases deployment costs. To address these limitations, this letter proposes a passive VLP algorithm based on Multi-Camera Joint Optimization (MCJO). In the considered system, multiple pre-calibrated cameras mounted on the ceiling continuously capture images of positioning targets equipped with point light sources, and can simultaneously localize these targets at the server. In particular, the proposed MCJO comprises two stages: It first estimates target positions via linear least squares from multi-view projection rays; then refines these positions through nonlinear joint optimization to minimize the reprojection error. Simulation results show that MCJO can achieve millimeter-level accuracy, with an improvement of 19% over state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results further show that MCJO can achieve an average position error as low as 5.63 mm.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS) with Orthogonal and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conducts a comprehensive performance analysis for pinching-antenna systems (PASS) under both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission. Given the cost of waveguides, we consider a scenario where the waveguide is not deployed in all rooms, i.e., some users are beyond the line-of-sight (LoS) link service area of the PASS. Specifically, we consider a PASS where a pinching antenna in one room serves two users located in separate rooms. The wireless transmissions between the pinching antenna and the users are performed via LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links, respectively. Closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities (OPs) of the two users are derived for the considered system. Furthermore, asymptotic analyses in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are performed to reveal the achievable diversity orders. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and show that: 1) compared with conventional antenna systems (CASS), the OP of the LoS user in PASS is significantly reduced for both OMA and NOMA schemes in the middle SNR regime and approaches zero as the SNR increases; 2) since the diversity orders of the NLoS user in CASS and PASS are the same, the movement of the pinching antenna has no significant effect on the OP of the NLoS user for the OMA and NOMA scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Achieve Explainable and Training-Free One-shot HRRP ATR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a pioneering, training-free and explainable framework for High-Resolution Range Profile (HRRP) automatic target recognition (ATR) utilizing large-scale pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). Diverging from conventional methods requiring extensive task-specific training or fine-tuning, our approach converts one-dimensional HRRP signals into textual scattering center representations. Prompts are designed to align LLMs' semantic space for ATR via few-shot in-context learning, effectively leveraging its vast pre-existing knowledge without any parameter update. We make our codes publicly available to foster research into LLMs for HRRP ATR.</description>

      <title>Refined Metrics, Sensing Limits, and Resource Allocation in OTFS-RSMA LEO ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an integrated OTFS-RSMA framework employing advanced SP techniques tailored for this demanding environment. We derive refined communication performance metrics, specifically SINR expressions capturing the practical effects of ICSI and ISIC. Moreover, fundamental sensing limits are established via CRB derivation incorporating parameter-dependent echo gain, linking waveform SP properties to estimation accuracy. The resource allocation is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem aiming for Max-Min Fairness under constraints derived from these SP metrics. Illustrative results, obtained via GA optimization, crucially demonstrate that the proposed RSMA scheme uniquely enables the simultaneous satisfaction of stringent communication and sensing constraints metrics, a capability not achieved by conventional SDMA. Such results {highlight the efficacy of the integrated OTFS-RSMA precoding and optimization approach for designing robust and feasible LEO-ISAC systems.

      <title>Online Bayesian system identification in multivariate autoregressive models via message passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for multivariate autoregressive models with exogenous inputs based on message passing in a factor graph. Unlike recursive least-squares, our method produces full posterior distributions for both the autoregressive coefficients and noise precision. The uncertainties regarding these estimates propagate into the uncertainties on predictions for future system outputs, and support online model evidence calculations. We demonstrate convergence empirically on a synthetic autoregressive system and competitive performance on a double mass-spring-damper system.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Multi-BS SSB Beam Design for Enhanced Initial Access Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring strong synchronization signal block (SSB) coverage is essential for reliable user equipment (UE) connection during initial access. While techniques such as power boosting and network densification are commonly used, this work explores joint transmission (JT) of SSBs as an alternative to enhance coverage. Although JT is widely applied in data transmission, its use for SSBs has not been explored due to the lack of channel state information, which prevents coherent signal alignment across base stations (BSs). To address this, we propose a repetition-based JT strategy using a small set of predefined phase configurations at the BSs. This enables the UE to coherently combine multiple SSB receptions and achieve constructive gain regardless of its location. To reduce overhead, a limited number of joint beam configurations is selected to maximize the coverage. Simulation results under the line-of-sight conditions show up to 6 dB relative SNR gain with JT of SSBs using 4 BSs, compared to independent SSB transmission under the same resource budget. These results highlight the potential of JT to improve the coverage of SSBs during the initial access.</description>

      <title>Simulate Any Radar: Attribute-Controllable Radar Simulation via Waveform Parameter Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including 2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine for autonomous driving applications. Code and additional materials are available at https://zhuxing0.github.io/projects/SA-Radar.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization for Aerial Multi-access Edge Computing via Cooperation of UAVs and HAPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an extensive increment of computation demands, the aerial multi-access edge computing (MEC), mainly based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high altitude platforms (HAPs), plays significant roles in future network scenarios. In detail, UAVs can be flexibly deployed, while HAPs are characterized with large capacity and stability. Hence, in this paper, we provide a hierarchical model composed of an HAP and multi-UAVs, to provide aerial MEC services. Moreover, considering the errors of channel state information from unpredictable environmental conditions, we formulate the problem to minimize the total energy cost with the chance constraint, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem with uncertain parameters and intractable to solve. To tackle this issue, we optimize the UAV deployment via the weighted K-means algorithm. Then, the chance constraint is reformulated via the distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Furthermore, based on the conditional value-at-risk mechanism, we transform the DRO problem into a mixed-integer second order cone programming, which is further decomposed into two subproblems via the primal decomposition. Moreover, to alleviate the complexity of the binary subproblem, we design a binary whale optimization algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes by comparing with baseline mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a major medical imaging modality. Clinical CT scenarios, such as low-dose screening, sparse-view scanning, and metal implants, often lead to severe noise and artifacts in reconstructed images, requiring improved reconstruction techniques. The introduction of deep learning has significantly advanced CT image reconstruction. However, obtaining paired training data remains rather challenging due to patient motion and other constraints. Although deep learning methods can still perform well with approximately paired data, they inherently carry the risk of hallucination due to data inconsistencies and model instability. In this paper, we integrate the data fidelity with the state-of-the-art generative AI model, referred to as the Poisson flow generative model (PFGM) with a generalized version PFGM++, and propose a novel CT framework: Flow-Oriented Reconstruction Conditioning Engine (FORCE). In our experiments, the proposed method shows superior performance in various CT imaging tasks, outperforming existing unsupervised reconstruction approaches.</description>

      <title>Absorb and Converge: Provable Convergence Guarantee for Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem to estimate probability densities in the context of multidimensional problems that are sampled with uneven probability. It considers detector sensitivity as an heterogeneous density and takes advantage of the computational speed and flexible boundary conditions offered by splines on a grid. We choose to regularize the Hessian of the spline via the nuclear norm to promote sparsity. As a result, the method is spatially adaptive and stable against the choice of the regularization parameter, which plays the role of the bandwidth. We test our computational pipeline on standard densities and provide software. We also present a new approach to PET rebinning as an application of our framework.</description>

Users typically have different rate demands and are clustered into groups in practice based on their requirements, where the former results in the trade-off between maximizing the rate and satisfying fine-grained rate demands, while the latter causes a trade-off between inter-group competition and intra-group cooperation when maximizing the sum rate. However, traditional approaches often overlook the joint optimization encompassing both of these trade-offs, disregarding potential optimal solutions and leaving some users even consistently at low date rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel joint optimization model for a RIS- and DF-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) system where a base station (BS) is with multiple antennas transmits data by multiple RISs and DF relays to serve grouped users with fine-grained rate demands. We design a new loss function to not only optimize the sum rate of all groups but also adjust the satisfaction ratio of fine-grained rate demands by modifying the penalty parameter. We further propose a two-phase graph neural network (GNN) based approach that inputs channel state information (CSI) to simultaneously and autonomously learn efficient phase shifts, beamforming, and relay selection. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves system performance.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large-Scale Movable Antenna-Enabled Multiuser Communications: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has been recognized as a promising technology to improve communication performance in future wireless networks such as 6G. To unleash its potential, this paper proposes a novel architecture, namely extremely large-scale MA (XL-MA), which allows flexible antenna/subarray positioning over an extremely large spatial region for effectively enhancing near-field effects and spatial multiplexing performance. In particular, this paper studies an uplink XL-MA-enabled multiuser system, where single-antenna users distributed in a coverage area are served by a base station (BS) equipped with multiple movable subarrays. We begin by presenting a spatially non-stationary channel model to capture the near-field effects, including positiondependent large-scale channel gains and line-of-sight visibility. To evaluate system performance, we further derive a closedform approximation of the expected weighted sum rate under maximum ratio combining (MRC), revealing that optimizing XLMA placement enhances user channel power gain to increase desired signal power and reduces channel correlation to decreases multiuser interference. Building upon this, we formulate an antenna placement optimization problem to maximize the expected weighted sum rate, leveraging statistical channel conditions and user distribution. To efficiently solve this challenging non-linear binary optimization problem, we propose a polynomial-time successive replacement algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed XL-MA placement strategy achieves nearoptimal performance, significantly outperforming benchmark schemes based on conventional fixed-position antennas.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Unseen-Emotion: Zero-shot Expressive Speech Synthesis with Prompt-LLM Contextual Knowledge for Mixed Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems primarily model a limited set of categorical emotions, whereas human conversations extend far beyond these predefined emotions, making it essential to explore more diverse emotional speech generation for more natural interactions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel prompt-unseen-emotion (PUE) approach to generate unseen emotional speech via emotion-guided prompt learning. PUE is trained utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model to quantify different emotional styles. Our proposed PUE successfully facilitates expressive speech synthesis of unseen emotions in a zero-shot setting.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented OTDR Fault Localization Framework for Resilient Rural Fiber Networks in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a novel framework that combines traditional Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) signal analysis with machine learning to localize and classify fiber optic faults in rural broadband infrastructures. The proposed system addresses a critical need in the expansion of middle-mile and last-mile networks, particularly in regions targeted by the U.S. Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program. By enhancing fault diagnosis through a predictive, AI-based model, this work enables proactive network maintenance in low-resource environments. Experimental evaluations using a controlled fiber testbed and synthetic datasets simulating rural network conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves detection accuracy and reduces false positives compared to conventional thresholding techniques. The solution offers a scalable, field-deployable tool for technicians and ISPs engaged in rural broadband deployment.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming for NOMA Assisted Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching antenna system (PASS) configures the positions of pinching antennas (PAs) along dielectric waveguides to change both large-scale fading and small-scale scattering, which is known as pinching beamforming. A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted PASS framework is proposed for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. The transmit power minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and power allocation. To solve this highly nonconvex problem, both gradient-based and swarm-based optimization methods are developed. 1) For gradient-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed. The Lipschitz gradient surrogate function is constructed based on MM to tackle the nonconvex terms of this problem. Then, the joint optimization problem is decomposed into subproblems that are alternatively optimized based on PDD to obtain stationary closed-form solutions. 2) For swarm-based method, a fast-convergent particle swarm optimization and zero forcing (PSO-ZF) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the PA position-seeking particles are constructed to explore high-quality pinching beamforming solutions. Moreover, ZF-based transmit beamforming is utilized by each particle for fast fitness function evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed NOMA assisted PASS and algorithms outperforms the conventional NOMA assisted massive antenna system. The proposed framework reduces over 95.22% transmit power compared to conventional massive MIMO-NOMA systems. ii) Swarm-based optimization outperforms gradient-based optimization by searching effective solution subspace to avoid stuck in undesirable local optima.</description>

      <title>PoLAR: Polar-Decomposed Low-Rank Adapter Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace, degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Pulse Based UWB ISAC Systems: A Parameter Estimation Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a bi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system for multi-target scenarios using impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) signals, which offer fine temporal resolution, low power consumption, and strong resistance to multipath interference. Two typical modulation schemes, namely pulse position modulation (PPM) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK), are considered for communication over the delay and phase domains, respectively. Accordingly, we introduce a pilot-based decoupling approach that relies on known time-delays, as well as a differential decoupling strategy that uses a known starting symbol position ({no pilot required}). A key contribution of this work is the development of a unified analytical framework based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which characterizes the fundamental coupling between communication and sensing in both delay and Doppler domains. This coupling is examined through the singularity structure of the FIM, providing new theoretical insights into the joint performance limits of UWB-ISAC systems. Finally, we assess the sensing and communication performance under various modulation schemes under the constraints of current UWB standards. This assessment utilizes the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for sensing and the data transmission rate for communication, offering theoretical insights into choosing suitable data signal processing methods in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Air pollutant exposure exhibits significant spatial and temporal variability, with localized hotspots, particularly in traffic microenvironments, posing health risks to commuters. Although widely used for air quality assessment, fixed-site monitoring stations are limited by sparse distribution, high costs, and maintenance needs, making them less effective in capturing on-road pollution levels. This study utilizes a fleet of 314 taxis equipped with sensors to measure NO\textsubscript{2}, PM\textsubscript{2.5}, and PM\textsubscript{10} concentrations and identify high-exposure hotspots. The findings reveal disparities between mobile and stationary measurements, map the spatiotemporal exposure patterns, and highlight local hotspots. These results demonstrate the potential of mobile monitoring to provide fine-scale, on-road air pollution assessments, offering valuable insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions and protect public health, particularly for sensitive populations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper proposes an SnS-aware CE framework based on adaptive subarray partitioning. We first investigate spherical wave propagation and various SnS characteristics and construct an SnS near-field channel model for XL-MIMO systems. Due to the limitations of uniform array partitioning in capturing SnS, we analyze the adverse effects of the non-ideal array segmentation (over- and under-segmentation) on CE accuracy. To counter these issues, we develop a dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which integrates power measurements with a dynamic hybrid beamforming structure to enable joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS) algorithm leverages the statistical properties of power profiles, while subarray decoupling is achieved via a subarray segmentation-based sampling method (SS-SM) under radio frequency (RF) chain constraints. For subarray CE, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV). This algorithm exploits angular-domain block sparsity under a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in CE performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high computational complexity of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is mainly caused by the subspace decomposition and spectrum search, especially for frequent real-time applications or massive sensors. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity MUSIC algorithm from finite-precision arithmetic perspective. First, we analyze the computational bottlenecks of the classic low-complexity randomized unitary-based MUSIC (RU-MUSIC), formulating this computational issue as an inner product problem. Then, a mixed-precision method is introduced to address this problem. Specifically, this method partitions summations in inner products into blocks, where intra-block computations use low-precision arithmetic and inter-block sums use high-precision arithmetic. To further improve computational accuracy, we develop an adaptive-precision method that supports adaptive block sizes and multiple precision levels. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed finite-precision MUSIC design achieves direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance similar to that using full-precision arithmetic while reducing more than 50\% computational cost.</description>

      <title>Unified Analysis of Decentralized Gradient Descent: a Contraction Mapping Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decentralized gradient descent (DGD) algorithm, and its sibling, diffusion, are workhorses in decentralized machine learning, distributed inference and estimation, and multi-agent coordination. We propose a novel, principled framework for the analysis of DGD and diffusion for strongly convex, smooth objectives, and arbitrary undirected topologies, using contraction mappings coupled with a result called the mean Hessian theorem (MHT). The use of these tools yields tight convergence bounds, both in the noise-free and noisy regimes. While these bounds are qualitatively similar to results found in the literature, our approach using contractions together with the MHT decouples the algorithm dynamics (how quickly the algorithm converges to its fixed point) from its asymptotic convergence properties (how far the fixed point is from the global optimum). This yields a simple, intuitive analysis that is accessible to a broader audience. Extensions are provided to multiple local gradient updates, time-varying step sizes, noisy gradients (stochastic DGD and diffusion), communication noise, and random topologies.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial aims to provide signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) practitioners with vital tools, in an accessible way, to answer the question: How to deal with missing data? There are many strategies to handle incomplete signals. In this paper, we propose to group these strategies based on three common tasks: i) missing-data imputation, ii) estimation with missing values and iii) prediction with missing values. We focus on methodological and experimental results through specific case studies on real-world applications. Promising and future research directions, including a better integration of informative missingness, are also discussed. We hope that the proposed conceptual framework and the presentation of recent missing-data problems related will encourage researchers of the SP and ML communities to develop original methods and to efficiently deal with new applications involving missing data.</description>

      <title>Improving Transformer Performance for French Clinical Notes Classification Using Mixture of Experts on a Limited Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown outstanding results in natural language processing but face challenges in applications like classifying small-scale clinical texts, especially with constrained computational resources. This study presents a customized Mixture of Expert (MoE) Transformer models for classifying small-scale French clinical texts at CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital. The MoE-Transformer addresses the dual challenges of effective training with limited data and low-resource computation suitable for in-house hospital use. Despite the success of biomedical pre-trained models such as CamemBERT-bio, DrBERT, and AliBERT, their high computational demands make them impractical for many clinical settings. Our MoE-Transformer model not only outperforms DistillBERT, CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and Transformer models on the same dataset but also achieves impressive results: an accuracy of 87\%, precision of 87\%, recall of 85\%, and F1-score of 86\%. While the MoE-Transformer does not surpass the performance of biomedical pre-trained BERT models, it can be trained at least 190 times faster, offering a viable alternative for settings with limited data and computational resources. Although the MoE-Transformer addresses challenges of generalization gaps and sharp minima, demonstrating some limitations for efficient and accurate clinical text classification, this model still represents a significant advancement in the field. It is particularly valuable for classifying small French clinical narratives within the privacy and constraints of hospital-based computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05625v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. In this regime, schemes based on sparse superposition coding can achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. However, these schemes are feasible only for small values of user payload. This paper investigates efficient schemes for larger user payloads, focusing on coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize its tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results show that the decoder achieves state-of-the-art performance at finite lengths, with a coded CDMA scheme defined using LDPC codes and a spatially coupled matrix of signature sequences.</description>

Abstract: In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h&lt;=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.</description>

      <title>Enabling 6G Performance in the Upper Mid-Band by Transitioning From Massive to Gigantic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial 6G networks will likely operate in the upper mid-band (7-24 GHz), which has decent propagation conditions but underwhelming new spectrum availability. In this paper, we explore whether we can anyway reach the ambitious 6G performance goals by evolving the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology from massive in 5G to gigantic in 6G. We describe how many antennas are needed to reach the envisioned 6G peak user rates, how many can realistically be deployed in practical radio equipment, and what the practical spatial degrees-of-freedom might become. We further suggest a new deployment strategy that enables the utilization of radiative near-field effects in these bands for precise beamfocusing, localization, and sensing from a single base station site. Finally, we identify open research and standardization challenges that must be overcome to efficiently use gigantic MIMO dimensions in 6G from hardware, cost, and algorithmic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Matrix Regression via Least-Angle Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix regression is a fundamental problem in data science with various applications in systems and control. Nuclear norm regularization has been widely applied to solve this problem due to its convexity. However, it suffers from high computational complexity and the inability to directly specify the rank. This work introduces a novel framework for low-rank matrix regression that addresses both unstructured and Hankel matrices. By decomposing the low-rank matrix into rank-1 bases, the problem is reformulated as an infinite-dimensional sparse learning problem. The least-angle regression (LAR) algorithm is then employed to solve this problem efficiently. For unstructured matrices, a closed-form LAR solution is derived with equivalence to a normalized nuclear norm regularization problem. For Hankel matrices, a real-valued polynomial basis reformulation enables effective LAR implementation. Two numerical examples in network modeling and system realization demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the nuclear norm method in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of unlabeled time-series data in domains such as wireless communications, radar, biomedical engineering, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven advancements in unsupervised learning. This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.</description>

      <title>DFRC Systems Co-existing in Licensed Spectrum: Cognitive Beamforming Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with cognitive radio capability to tackle the spectral scarcity problem in wireless communications. Particularly, a cognitive DFRC system operates on a spectrum owned by a primary system to simultaneously perform data communication and target tracking with the condition that its interference to the primary users (PUs) is below a certain threshold. To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly design the beamforming vectors for both the radar and communication functions in such a way that the mean square error (MSE) of the beam pattern between the designed and desired waveforms is minimized. The optimization problem has the following three constraints: i) the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each data communication user is above a predetermined level; ii) the per-antenna transmit power is maintained at a given level; iii) the interference imposed on each PU is below a certain threshold. Both the semidefinite relaxation and nature-inspired firefly algorithms are proposed in order to search for the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. The simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithms can enable the DFRC system to protect the PUs while simultaneously performing its communication and radar functions.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.</description>
