      <title>A quantitative analysis of Galilei's observations of Jupiter satellites from the Sidereus Nuncius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the observations of the satellites of Jupiter from the Sidereus Nuncius (January 7 to March 1, 1610) and compare them to the predictions obtained using a modern sky simulator, verifying them one by one. A sinusoidal fit of the data obtained from the 64 available sketches, allows measuring the relative major semi-axes of the satellites' orbits and their periods with a statistical precision of 2-4\% and 0.1-0.3\% respectively. The periods are basically unbiased while the orbits tend to be underestimated for Callisto by about 12\%. The posterior fit error indicates that the positions of the satellites are determined with a resolution of 0.4-0.6 Jupiter diameters in the notation of Galilei corresponding to about 40- 70 arc sec i.e. similar to the true angular diameter of Jupiter, in those days. We show that with this data one can infer in a convincing way the third law of Kepler for the Jupiter system. The 1:2 and 1:4 orbital resonance between the periods of Io and Europa/Ganymede can be determined with \% precision. In order to obtain these results it is important to separate the four datasets. This operation, which is nowadays simple using a sky simulator, and is fully reported in this work, was an extremely difficult task for Galilei as the analysis will evidence. Nevertheless we show how the four periods might have been extracted using the modern Lomb-Scargle technique without having to separate the four data-sets already just using these early observations. We also perform a critical evaluation of the accuracy of the observation of the Pleiades and other clusters and the Moon.</description>

      <title>The rise of stochasticity in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last 175 years, the physical understanding of
  nature has seen a revolutionary change. Until about 1850, Newton's
  theory and the mechanical world view derived from it provided the
  dominant view of the physical world, later supplemented by Maxwell's
  theory of the electromagnetic field. That approach was entirely
  deterministic and free of probabilistic concepts. In contrast to
  that conceptual edifice, today many fields of physics are governed
  by probabilistic concepts. Statistical mechanics in its classical or
  quantum version and random-matrix theory are obvious
  examples. Quantum mechanics is an intrinsically statistical
  theory. Classical chaos and its quantum manifestations also require
  a stochastic approach. The paper describes how a combination of
  discoveries and conceptual problems undermined the mechanical world
  view, led to novel concepts, and shaped the modern understanding of
  physics.</description>

Abstract: The processual consciousness interpretation (PCI), as developed in Arroyo (2024, chap. 5) and Arroyo, Nunes Filho, and Moreira dos Santos (2024), proposes a process ontology as a solution to the measurement problem. This article presents the standard interpretation taken to its ultimate ontological consequences; introduces the PCI; and offers reflections based on the questions raised about the PCI during the XX ANPOF Meeting, in the session of the WG on Philosophy of the Physical Sciences.</description>

      <title>What makes you an observer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both empirical and theoretical objective science can only access relations, revealing nothing about the intrinsic nature of the entities "in relation". We typically refer to these entities as "matter", assuming their nature is irrelevant and that relational structures alone explain all phenomena, including consciousness. This would imply that consciousness arises not from matter itself but solely from its structural configurations. Consequently, if two worlds possess isomorphic structures and obey identical dynamical laws, isomorphic systems within these worlds should be equally sentient or insentient.
  I demonstrate that if this premise held true, the memories within an observer's brain would bear no correlation to the external world. Yet since we do acquire knowledge of the external world, structure alone must be insufficient: there exists something beyond relations, the intrinsic essence of the "stuff in relation". This essence imbues the observer's structure with sentience, metaphorically "breathing fire" into it. In turn, the observer confers physical meaning upon the world's structures.
  Remarkably, this conclusion emerges directly from physics and mathematics. Without acknowledging this intrinsic element, we would be incapable not only of subjective experience but also of acquiring any objective knowledge about the physical world.</description>

      <title>Myths of Nuclear Graphite in World War II, with Original Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine a common narrative that experimental errors by Walther Bothe in 1941 led Germany to abandon graphite as a reactor moderator during World War II. Using document-based nuclear archaeology, we first show that both American and German scientists used an incorrect carbon scattering cross section, thereby undermining the accuracy of all wartime data, including their conclusions on carbon's absorption. Moreover, we argue that the availability of exceptionally pure petroleum coke in the United States, rather than any academic breakthrough, decisively enabled their production of nuclear-grade graphite. In contrast, Bothe's Siemens electrographite had more boron contamination than any graphites considered in Fermi's experiments, rendering it genuinely impractical as a moderator. By reframing the decision to eschew graphite as a deliberate decision rather than a mere experimental oversight, we believe the German decision was a rational consequence of a complex interplay between material constraints and wartime priorities.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Divide(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the potential divides from emerging quantum technologies (QT) on society, covering impacts on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We aim to challenge the concept of a single "quantum divide" by offering a comprehensive view. We propose four divides: in science, technologies, between countries, and within societies. The "Quantum Divide in Science" highlights gaps among scientists and access inequalities in research communities. The second divide, "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency," looks at technology adoption processes. The "Quantum Divide between Countries" examines adoption reasons and outcomes across countries with varying development levels. Lastly, the "Quantum Divide within Societies" addresses societal implications, one of the most discussed in literature. We propose directions to navigate these divides, noting their interconnectedness and impact on innovation ecosystems. This study guides those interested in the quantum divide, navigation strategies, and QT's influence on scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</description>

      <title>On the detectability of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper I present the state of the art concerning the theoretical detectability (and the open challenges for the experimental detectability) of a special class of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions. The particles under considerations, obeying a parastatistics, are mutually exchanged via the permutation group and can exist in any space dimension (the anyons, which transform under the more general braid group, cannot exist in more than two space dimensions).</description>
