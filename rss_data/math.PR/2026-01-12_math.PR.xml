      <title>Noise sensitivity in last-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of noise sensitivity of Boolean functions was initiated in a seminal paper of Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm, published in 1999. While this study has revealed fascinating phenomena in the context of Bernoulli percolation, few results have been obtained regarding other random spatial processes. In this paper we prove the first instance of noise sensitivity for a spatial growth process associated to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class of universality. More specifically, we show that travel times in geometric last-passage percolation are noise sensitive with respect to a perturbation acting on a Bernoulli encoding of the geometric weights. Our method of proof includes a generalisation of the celebrated Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm noise sensitivity/influence theorem, and precise bounds on the probability of a given vertex being on a geodesic, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Metastable opinion dynamics with hidden preferences: an Ising model with neutral agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new Ising-type framework for opinion dynamics that explicitly separates private preferences from publicly expressed binary opinions and naturally incorporates neutral agents. Each individual is endowed with an immutable hidden preference, while public opinions evolve through Metropolis dynamics on a finite graph. This formulation extends classical sociophysical Ising models by capturing the tension between internal conviction, social conformity, and neutrality. Focusing on highly symmetric grid networks and spatially structured hidden-preference patterns, we analyze the resulting low-temperature dynamics using the pathwise approach to metastability. We provide a complete characterization of stable and metastable configurations, identify the maximal stability level of the energy landscape, and derive sharp asymptotics for hitting and mixing times. A central technical contribution is a new family of isoperimetric inequalities for polyominoes on the torus, which emerge from a geometric representation of opinion clusters and play a key role in determining critical configurations and energy barriers. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of how spatial heterogeneity in hidden preferences qualitatively reshapes collective opinion transitions and illustrate the power of geometric and probabilistic methods in the study of complex interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Semicircle law for multi-parameter random simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the multi-parameter random simplicial complex model, which generalizes the Linial-Meshulam model and random clique complexes by allowing simplices of different dimensions to be included with distinct probabilities. For $n,d \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,p_2,\ldots, p_d)$ such that $p_i \in (0,1]$ for all $1 \leq i \leq d$, the multi-parameter random simplicial complex $Y_d(n,\mathbf{p})$ is constructed inductively. Starting with $n$ vertices, edges (1-cells) are included independently with probability $p_1$, yielding the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p_1)$, which forms the $1$-skeleton. Conditional on the $(k-1)$-skeleton, each possible $k$-cell is included independently with probability $p_k$, for $2 \leq k \leq d$.
  We study the signed and unsigned adjacency matrices of $d$-dimensional multi-parameter random simplicial complexes $Y_d(n,\mathbf{p}),$ under the assumptions $\min_{i=1,\ldots d-1}\liminf p_i &gt;0$ and $np_d \rightarrow \infty$ with $p_d=o(1)$. In general, these matrices have random dimensions and exhibit dependency among its entries. We prove that the empirical spectral distributions of both matrices converge weakly to the semicircle law in probability.</description>

      <title>Imry-Ma phenomenon for the hard-core model on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{Imry-Ma phenomenon} refers to the dramatic effect that disorder can have on first-order phase transitions for two-dimensional spin systems. The most famous example is the absence of a phase transition for the two-dimensional random-field Ising model. This paper establishes that a similar phenomena takes place for the hard-core model, a discrete model of crystallization: arbitrarily weak disorder prevents the formation of a crystal. Our proof of this behaviour is an adaptation of the Aizenman-Wehr argument for the Imry-Ma phenomenon, with the use of internal (spin space) symmetries for spin systems being replaced by the use spatial symmetries.</description>

      <title>Fourier restriction for the additive Brownian sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier restriction problem asks when it is meaningful to restrict the Fourier transform of a function to a given set. Many of the key examples are smooth co-dimension 1 manifolds, although there is increasing interest in fractal sets. Here we propose a natural intermediary problem where one considers the fractal surface generated by the graph of the additive Brownian sheet in $\mathbb{R}^k$. We obtain the first non-trivial estimates in this direction, giving both a sufficient condition on the range of $q\in[1,2]$ for the Fourier transform to be $L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{k+1})\to L^2(G(W))$ bounded and a necessary condition for it to be $L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{k+1})\to L^p(G(W))$ bounded. The sufficient condition is obtained via the Fourier spectrum, which is a family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. Our main technical result, which is of interest in its own right, gives a precise formula for the Fourier spectrum of the natural measure on the graph of the additive Brownian sheet, and we apply this result to the Fourier restriction problem. Our restriction estimate is stronger than the estimate obtained from the well-known Stein--Tomas restriction theorem for all $k\geq3$. We obtain the necessary condition in two different ways, one via the Fourier spectrum and one via an appropriate Knapp example.</description>

      <title>On a stochastic phase-field model of cell motility with singular diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence of solutions in the variational sense for a class of stochastic phase-field models describing moving boundary problems. The models consist of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with singular diffusion forced by a phase-field. We investigate both the case of an independently evolving phase-field and of coupled phase-field evolution driven by a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Such systems are used in the modelling of single-cell chemotaxis, where the contour of the cell shape corresponds to a level set of the phase-field. The technical challenge lies in the singularities at zero level sets of the phase-field. For large classes of initial data, we establish global existence of probabilistically weak solutions in $L^2$-spaces with weights which compensate for the singularities.</description>

      <title>From Queues to Crowd Flows: Reflected Diffusion Limits for Controlled Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a diffusion approximation for a class of multi-agent controlled queueing systems, demonstrating their convergence to a system of interacting reflected Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. The limiting process captures essential behavioral features of the underlying stochastic dynamics, including goal-directed motion, inter-agent repulsion, and reflection at domain boundaries. This result provides a rigorous analytical framework for approximating constrained queueing networks and crowd motion models, offering tractable characterizations of their steady-state behavior and transient dynamics under large-scale regimes. We further illustrate the theoretical findings through two numerical examples. The first example considers a crowd dynamics scenario, modeling interacting agents navigating within a confined domain, while the second focuses on a neural population model that describes stochastic activity evolution under competition and bounded constraints. These experiments validate the convergence predicted by the diffusion approximation and demonstrate how discrete stochastic systems with reflection and interaction mechanisms approach their continuous reflected OU limits, offering both physical and biosocial interpretations of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an invariance principle for a general class of continuous time critical branching processes with finite variance (non-local) branching mechanism. We show that the genealogical trees, viewed as random compact metric measure spaces, converge under rescaling to the Brownian continuum random tree in the Gromov-Hausdorff-weak topology, establishing a universal scaling limit for critical finite variance branching processes.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive central limit theorem for a class of driven diffusive systems at the critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-scale behaviour of a class of driven diffusive systems modelled by a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation, the Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) with general nonlinearity, at the critical dimension and in infinite volume. Our main result shows that, under a logarithmically superdiffusive space-time scaling, it is given by the same explicit Gaussian Fixed point obtained in [G. Cannizzaro, Q. Moulard, &amp; F. Toninelli, arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344, 2025] for the quadratic SBE, but with suitably renormalised coefficients, thereby rigorously justifying and partly correcting the classical Physics derivation of the SBE in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, &amp; H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] based on Spohn's theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics. Besides, ours is the first universality-type result for out-of-equilibrium systems and the first extension of [M. Hairer, J. Quastel, Forum of Mathematics, Pi, Vol. 6, 2018, e3], to the critical dimension and beyond weak coupling. The major challenge in our work is the mild growth condition on the nonlinearity which renders even the well-posedness of the microscopic equation non-trivial. Additional key novelties include the derivation of fine estimates on the non-quadratic part of the generator as well as a new approximation for the resolvent associated to the solution of the quadratic SBE.</description>

      <title>Note on edge expansion and modularity in preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge expansion is a parameter indicating how well-connected a graph is. It is useful for designing robust networks, analysing random walks or information flow through a network and is an important notion in theoretical computer science. Modularity is a measure of how well a graph can be partitioned into communities and is widely used in clustering applications. We study these two parameters in two commonly considered models of random preferential attachment graphs, with $h \geq 2$ edges added per step. We establish new bounds for the likely edge expansion for both random models. Using bounds for edge expansion of small subsets of vertices, we derive new upper bounds also for the modularity values for small $h$.</description>

      <title>Refined uniqueness results for 2D Euler and gSQG with rough Kraichnan noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove strong well-posedness results for the stochastic 2D Euler equations in vorticity form and generalized SQG equations, with $L^p$ initial data and driven by a spatially rough, incompressible transport noise of Kraichnan type. Previous works addressed this problem with noise of spatial regularity $\alpha\in (0,1/2)$, in a setting where a rougher noise yields a stronger regularization. We remove this limitation by allowing any $\alpha \in (0,1)$, covering the same range of parameters for which anomalous regularization effects are known to occur in passive scalars. In particular, this covers the physically relevant case $\alpha=2/3$, associated with the Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling of energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Graph energy as a measure of community detectability in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.</description>

Abstract: We derive the Pontryagin maximum principle and $Q$-functions for the relaxed control of noisy rough differential equations. Our main tool is the development of a novel differentiation procedure along `spike variation' perturbations of the optimal state-control pair. We then exploit our development of the infinitesimal $Q$-function (also known as the $q$-function) to derive a policy improvement algorithm for settings with entropic cost constraints.</description>

      <title>Dimension gap and phase transition for one-dimensional random walks with reflective boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z$- and $\mathbb N$-extensions of interval maps with at most countably many full branches modelling one-dimensional random walks without and with a reflective boundary. We analyse the associated Gurevich pressure and explore the relations governing these two cases. For such extensions, we obtain variational formulae for the Gurevich pressure that depend only on the base system. As a consequence, we characterise the systems with a dimension gap and, in the presence of a reflective boundary, provide general conditions in terms of asymptotic covariances for a second order phase transition. As a by-product, we derive a variational formula for the spectral radius of infinite Hessenberg matrices.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Implications of the Low-Degree Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the low-degree heuristic has been used to estimate the algorithmic thresholds for a wide range of average-case planted vs null distinguishing problems. Such results rely on the hypothesis that if the low-degree moments of the planted and null distributions are sufficiently close, then no efficient (noise-tolerant) algorithm can distinguish between them. This hypothesis is appealing due to the simplicity of calculating the low-degree likelihood ratio (LDLR) -- a quantity that measures the similarity between low-degree moments. However, despite sustained interest in the area, it remains unclear whether low-degree indistinguishability actually rules out any interesting class of algorithms.
  In this work, we initiate the study and develop technical tools for translating LDLR upper bounds to rigorous lower bounds against concrete algorithms. As a consequence, we prove: for any permutation-invariant distribution $\mathsf{P}$,
  1. If $\mathsf{P}$ is over $\{0,1\}^n$ and is low-degree indistinguishable from $U = \mathrm{Unif}(\{0,1\}^n)$, then a noisy version of $\mathsf{P}$ is statistically indistinguishable from $U$.
  2. If $\mathsf{P}$ is over $\mathbb{R}^n$ and is low-degree indistinguishable from the standard Gaussian ${N}(0, 1)^n$, then no statistic based on symmetric polynomials of degree at most $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ can distinguish between a noisy version of $\mathsf{P}$ from ${N}(0, 1)^n$.
  3. If $\mathsf{P}$ is over $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and is low-degree indistinguishable from ${N}(0,1)^{n\times n}$, then no constant-sized subgraph statistic can distinguish between a noisy version of $\mathsf{P}$ and ${N}(0, 1)^{n\times n}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Poincar\'e inequality for quantum Markov semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a noncommutative $(p,p)$-Poincar\'e inequality for trace-symmetric quantum Markov semigroups on tracial von Neumann algebras, assuming only the existence of a spectral gap. Extending semi-commutative results of Huang and Tropp, our argument uses Markov dilations to obtain chain-rule estimates for Dirichlet forms and employs amalgamated free products to define an appropriate noncommutative derivation. We further generalize the argument to non-tracial $\sigma$-finite von Neumann algebras under the weaker assumption of GNS-detailed balance, using Haagerup's reduction and Kosaki's interpolation theorem. As applications, we recover noncommutative Khintchine and sub-exponential concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.</description>

      <title>A Hal\'asz-type theorem for permutation anticoncentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ of real numbers and real coefficients $b_1,\ldots,b_n$, consider the distribution of the sum obtained by pairing the $a_i$'s with the $b_i$'s according to a uniformly random permutation. A recent theorem of Pawlowski shows that as soon as the coefficients are not all equal, this distribution is always spread out at scale $n^{-1}$: no single value can occur with probability larger than $\frac{1}{2\lceil n/2\rceil + 1}$, and this bound is sharp in general.
  We show that stronger anticoncentration holds when the coefficients have additional diversity. We quantify the structure of the coefficient multiset by a simple statistic depending on its multiplicity profile, and prove that the maximum point mass of the permuted sum decays polynomially faster as this statistic grows. In particular, when the coefficients are all distinct we obtain a bound of $n^{-5/2+o(1)}$, which can be regarded as an analogue of a classical theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Moser.</description>

      <title>Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step.
  When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equations for McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the probability distribution of solutions to McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H&gt;1/2.
  Our main contribution is the derivation of the associated Fokker--Planck equation, which characterizes the time evolution of the law of the solution in a suitable distributional framework. Under mild assumptions, we show that the law-valued process is absolutely continuous in time and provide an explicit weak formulation of the corresponding fractional McKean--Vlasov Fokker--Planck equation. In the case where the law admits a density, we obtain a more explicit partial differential equation with time-dependent diffusion coefficients induced by the fractional noise.
  We further establish a fractional Feynman--Kac representation, linking the forward Fokker--Planck equation with a backward Kolmogorov equation for functionals of the solution process. This result extends the classical Feynman--Kac framework to mean--field dynamics driven by fractional Brownian motion.
  To illustrate the theory, we analyze several explicit examples, including the law of fractional Brownian motion itself and linear McKean--Vlasov fractional SDEs. These examples highlight how fractional noise and mean--field interactions jointly affect the probabilistic and analytic structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Conformally invariant boundary arcs in double dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two different versions of the double dimer model on a planar domain, where we either fold a single dimer cover on a symmetric domain onto itself across the line of symmetry, or we superimpose two independent dimer covers on two, almost identical, domains that differ only on a certain portion of the boundary. This results in a collection of loops and doubled edges that, unlike in the classical double dimer case of Kenyon, are accompanied by arcs emanating from the line of symmetry or the chosen portion of the boundary. We argue that these arcs together with the associated height function satisfy a discrete version of the coupling of Qian and Werner between the Arc loop ensemble (ALE) and two different variants of the Gaussian free field (with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions). We also show that certain statistics of the arcs (when the loops are disregarded from the picture) converge to conformally invariant quantities in the small-mesh scaling limit, and moreover the limits are the same for the two versions of the model, and equal to the corresponding statistics of the arc loop ensemble (ALE). This gives evidence to the conjecture of [7] (that concerns one of these models).</description>

      <title>Modularity of preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the preferential attachment model $G_n^h$. A graph $G_n^h$ is generated from a finite initial graph by adding new vertices one at a time. Each new vertex connects to $h\ge 1$ already existing vertices, and these are chosen with probability proportional to their current degrees. We are particularly interested in the community structure of $G_n^h$, which is expressed in terms of the so-called modularity. We prove that the modularity of $G_n^h$ is with high probability upper bounded by a function that tends to $0$ as $h$ tends to infinity. This resolves the conjecture of Prokhorenkova, Pralat, and Raigorodskii from 2016.
  As a byproduct, we obtain novel concentration results (which are interesting in their own right) for the volume and edge density parameters of vertex subsets of $G_n^h$. The key ingredient here is the definition of the function $\mu$, which serves as a natural measure for vertex subsets, and is proportional to the average size of their volumes. This extends previous results on the topic by Frieze, Pralat, P\'erez-Gim\'enez, and Reiniger from 2019.</description>

      <title>Strong law of large numbers for a branching random walk among Bernoulli traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a $d$-dimensional branching random walk (BRW) in an i.i.d. random environment on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in discrete time. A Bernoulli trap field is attached to $\mathbb{Z}^d$, where each site, independently of the others, is a trap with a fixed probability. The interaction between the BRW and the trap field is given by the hard killing rule. Given a realization of the environment, over each time step, each particle first moves according to a simple symmetric random walk to a nearest neighbor, and immediately afterwards, splits into two particles if the new site is not a trap or is killed instantly if the new site is a trap. Conditional on the ultimate survival of the BRW, we prove a strong law of large numbers for the total mass of the process. Our result is quenched, that is, it holds in almost every environment in which the starting point of the BRW is inside the infinite connected component of trap-free sites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10939v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the mean field backward stochastic differential equations (MFBSDEs) with double mean reflections, whose generator and constraints both depend on the distribution of the solution. When the generator is Lipschitz continuous, based on the backward Skorokhod problem with nonlinear constraints, we investigate the solvability of the doubly mean reflected MFBSDEs by constructing a contraction mapping. Furthermore, if the constraints are linear, the solution can also be constructed by a penalization method. For the case of quadratic growth, we obtain the existence and uniqueness results by using a fixed-point argument, the BMO martingale theory and the {\theta}-method.</description>

      <title>Mixing trichotomy for random walks on directed stochastic block models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a directed version of the classical Stochastic Block Model with $m\ge 2$ communities and a parameter $\alpha$ controlling the inter-community connectivity. We show that, depending on the scaling of $\alpha$, the mixing time of the random walk on this graph can exhibit three different behaviors, which we refer to as subcritical, critical and supercritical. In the subcritical regime, the total variation distance to equilibrium decays abruptly, providing the occurrence of the so-called cutoff phenomenon. In the supercritical regime, the mixing is governed by the inter-community jumps, and the random walk exhibits a metastable behavior: at first it collapses to a local equilibrium, then, on a larger timescale, it can be effectively described as a mean-field process on the $m$ communities, with a decay to equilibrium which is asymptotically smooth and exponential. Finally, for the critical regime, we show a sort of interpolation of the two above-mentioned behaviors. Although the metastable behavior shown in the supercritical regime appears natural from a heuristic standpoint, a substantial part of our analysis can be read as a control on the homogenization of the underlying random environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetric random walk is known to be recurrent in one and two dimensions, and becomes transient in three or higher dimensions. We compare the symmetric random walk to walks driven by certain \polya\ urns. We show that, in contrast, if the probabilities of the random walk are instead driven by a \polya-Eggenberger urn, the states are recurrent only in one dimension. Further consideration of exchangeability reveals that the walk is null recurrent. As soon as the underlying Markov chain of \polya\ walk gets in two dimensions or higher, there is a positive probability that the walker gets lost in the space, and the probability of her recurrence is less than 1.
  On the other hand, a walk driven by Friedman urn behaves like the symmetric random walk, being recurrent in one and two dimensions and transient in higher dimensions. As Friedman urn scheme is not exchangeable, it is considerably harder to determine the nature of the recurrence in one and two dimensions. Empirical evidence through simulation suggests that in one dimension Friedman walk is positive recurrent.</description>

      <title>Moment estimates for solutions of SPDEs with L\'evy colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we continue the investigations initiated by the first author in Balan (2015) related to the study of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with L\'evy colored noise on $\mathbb{R}_{+} \times \mathbb{R}^d$. This noise is constructed from a L\'evy white noise (which is in turn built from a Poisson random measure with intensity $dtdx \nu(dz)$), using the convolution with a suitable spatial kernel $\kappa$. We assume that the L\'evy measure $\nu$ has finite variance. Therefore, the stochastic integral with respect to this noise is constructed similarly to the integral with respect to the spatially-homogeneous Gaussian case considered in Dalang (1999). Using Rosenthal's inequality, we provide an upper bound for the $p$-th moment of the stochastic integral with respect to the L\'evy colored noise, which allows us to identify sufficient conditions for the solution of an SPDE driven by this noise to have higher order moments. We first analyze this question for the linear SPDE, considering as examples the stochastic heat and wave equations in any dimension $d$, for three examples of kernels $\kappa$: the heat kernel, the Riesz kernel, and the Bessel kernel. Then, we present a general theory for a non-linear SPDE with Lipschitz coefficients, and perform a detailed analysis in the case of the heat equation (in dimension $d\geq 1$), and wave equation (in dimension $d\leq 3$), for the same kernels $\kappa$. We show that the solution of each of these equations has a finite upper Lyapounov exponent of order $p\geq 2$, and in some cases, is weakly intermittent (in the sense of Foondun and Khoshnevisan, 2013). In the case of the parabolic/hyperbolic Anderson model with L\'evy colored noise, we provide the Poisson chaos expansion of the solution and the explicit form of the second-order Lyapounov exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the recurrence structure of the infinite server queue, as viewed through the prism of the maximum dater sequence, namely the time to drain the current work in the system as seen at arrival epochs. Despite the importance of this model in queueing theory, we are aware of no complete analysis of the stability behavior of this model, especially in settings in which either or both the inter arrival and service time distributions have infinite mean. In this paper, we fully develop the analog of the Loynes construction of the stationary version in the context of stationary ergodic inputs, extending earlier work of E.Altman (2005), and then classify the Markov chain when the inputs are independent and identically distributed. This allows us to classify the chain, according to transience, recurrence in the sense of Harris, and positive recurrence in the sense of Harris. We further go on to develop tail asymptotics for the stationary distribution of the maximum dater sequence, when the service times have tails that are asymptotically exponential or Pareto, and we contrast the stability theory for the infinite server queue relative to that for the single server queue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the triangle $T$ with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$. The lower boundary of the convex hull of $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, together with $n$ independent uniformly distributed random points in $T$, is called a random convex chain and denoted by $T_n$. We study the random variable $f_0(T_n)$, the number of vertices of this chain. Our first result gives an explicit expression for the bivariate generating function of the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$ in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. Building on this analytic representation, we apply a careful singularity analysis to derive a variety of limit theorems for $f_0(T_n)$, including a quantitative central limit theorem, a large deviation principle as well as a precise asymptotics for the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$. Conceptually, our results establish a novel bridge between stochastic geometry and methods from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-compactness for dominated kernels with application to quasi-stationary distribution theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a domination principle for positive operators, which provides an upper bound on the essential spectral radius and yields quasi-compactness criteria on weighted supremum spaces with Lyapunov type functions and local domination. In particular, for kernels acting on such spaces, we obtain $r_{ess}(P)\leq r_{ess}(Q)$ whenever $0\leq P\leq Q$ as kernels, a property that is known to fail in general on $L^p$ spaces, $p&lt;+\infty$.
  We then describe the asymptotics of iterates of positive quasi-compact kernels, showing convergence, after suitable renormalization, towards a finite decomposition over eigenelements, and we study the long-time behaviour of quasi-compact continuous-time semigroups. For the latter, we prove that measurability in time and quasi-compactness at a single positive time imply quasi-compactness at all times, exclude periodic behaviour, and entail convergence to eigenelements as time goes to infinity.
  Finally, we apply these results to absorbed Markov processes and quasi-stationary distributions. In this setting, the domination and Lyapunov criteria allow one to work in reducible situations and to relax classical regularity assumptions, for instance replacing strong Feller conditions by domination from a regular kernel or by locally uniformly integrable densities on suitable weighted supremum spaces.</description>

      <title>Conditional means, vector pricings, amenability and fixed points in cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalization of conditional probability for arbitrary ordered vector spaces. A related problem is that of assigning a numerical value to one vector relative to another.
  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. Our results deviate from the setting of classical probability; this leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity and concentration bounds for a single gap between GUE eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that the distribution of the eigenvalues of an $N$-by-$N$ GUE random matrix is log-concave on $\mathbb{R}^N$, and that the same is true for the law of a single gap between two consecutive eigenvalues. We use this observation to prove several concentration bounds for the semicircle-renormalised eigengaps, improving on bounds recently obtained in [Tao (2024). On the distribution of eigenvalues of GUE and its minors at fixed index. [arXiv:2412.10889]].</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Scalogram Ridges in Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While ridges in the scalogram, determined by the squared modulus of analytic wavelet transform (AWT), is a widely accepted concept and utilized in nonstationary time series analysis, their behavior in noisy environments remains underexplored. Our object is to provide a theoretical foundation for scalogram ridges by defining ridges as a potentially set-valued random process connecting local maxima of the scalogram along the scale axis and analyzing their properties when the signal fulfills the adaptive harmonic model and is contaminated by stationary Gaussian noise. In addition to establishing several key properties of the AWT for random processes, we investigate the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting random ridge points in the scalogram. Specifically, we establish the uniqueness property of the ridge point at individual time instances and prove the upper hemicontinuity of the ridge random process. Furthermore, we derive bounds on the probability that the deviation between the ridges of noisy and clean signals exceeds a specified threshold, and these bounds depend on the signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve these ridge deviation results, we derive maximal inequalities for the complex modulus of nonstationary Gaussian processes, leveraging classical tools such as the Borell-TIS inequality and Dudley's theorem, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stochastic interpretations of the oceanic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how weakening the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis impacts the well-posedness of the stochastic LU primitive equations. The models we consider are intermediate between the incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and the LU primitive equations with standard hydrostatic balance. As such, they are expected to be numerically tractable, while accounting well for phenomena within the grey zone between hydrostatic balance and non-hydrostatic processes. Our main result is the well-posedness of a low-pass filtering-based stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations, with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, in the limit of ``quasi-barotropic'' flow. This assumption is linked to the structure assumption proposed in the work of Agresti et al., which can be related to the dynamical regime where the primitive equations remain valid. Furthermore, we present and study two eddy-(hyper)viscosity-based models.</description>

      <title>Filtering in a hazard rate change-point model with financial and life-insurance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous-time filtering framework for estimating a hazard rate subject to an unobservable change-point. This framework naturally arises in both financial and insurance applications, where the default intensity of a firm or the mortality rate of an individual may experience a sudden jump at an unobservable time, representing, for instance, a shift in the firm's risk profile or a deterioration in an individual's health status. By employing a progressive enlargement of filtration, we integrate noisy observations of the hazard rate with default-related information. We characterise the filter, i.e. the conditional probability of the change-point given the information flow, as the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by the innovation process enriched with the discontinuous component. A sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the filter's behaviour under various information structures are provided. Our framework further allows for the derivation of an explicit formula for the survival probability conditional on partial information. This result applies to the pricing of credit-sensitive financial instruments such as defaultable bonds, credit default swaps, and life insurance contracts. Finally, a numerical analysis illustrates how partial information leads to delayed adjustments in the estimation of the hazard rate and consequently to mispricing of credit-sensitive instruments when compared to a full-information setting.</description>

      <title>Noise estimation of SDE from a single data trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for model discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) from a single trajectory, without requiring the ergodicity or stationary assumption on the underlying continuous process. By combining (stochastic) Taylor expansions with Girsanov transformations, and using the drift function's initial value as input, we construct drift estimators while simultaneously recovering the model noise. This allows us to recover the underlying $\mathbb P$ Brownian motion increments. Building on these estimators, we introduce the first stochastic Sparse Identification of Stochastic Differential Equation (SSISDE) algorithm, capable of identifying the governing SDE dynamics from a single observed trajectory without requiring ergodicity or stationarity. To validate the proposed approach, we conduct numerical experiments with both linear and quadratic drift-diffusion functions. Among these, the Black-Scholes SDE is included as a representative case of a system that does not satisfy ergodicity or stationarity.</description>

      <title>Effective Erd\H{o}s--Wintner for Cantor numeration systems via a trailing-window method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove explicit Erd\H{o}s--Wintner bounds for Cantor numeration systems via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor numeration systems. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</description>

      <title>Study of a TPFA scheme for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with constraint though numerical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution provides numerical experiments for a finite volume scheme for an approximation of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The approximation is done by a Yosida approximation of the subdifferential operator. The problem is set on a polygonal bounded domain in two or three dimensions. The non-linear character of the projection term induces challenges to implement the scheme. To this end, we provide a splitting method for the finite volume scheme. We show that the splitting method is accurate. The computational error estimates induce that the squared $L^2$-error w.r.t. time is of order $1$ as long as the noise term is small enough. For larger noise terms the order of convergence w.r.t. time might become worse.</description>
