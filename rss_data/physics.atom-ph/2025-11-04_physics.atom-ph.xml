      <title>Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the recombination rates into quantum bound channels across a series of ion-atom scattering lengths. Our results confirms the breakdown of the theory of 'van-der-Waals universality' and the effective range theory, both of which fail to describe the recombination rates in ion-atom systems for large scattering lengths. We investigate this phenomenon further -- through calculations we observe the appearance of weakly bound ionic triatomic molecules. We compare the spectrum and lifetimes of these trimers to neutral system and present results indicating that such trimers could be stable with respect to modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Hf$^{12+}$ ion: Highly Charged Ion for Next-Generation Atomic Clocks and Tests of Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use advanced computational techniques to study the electronic structure of the Hf$^{12+}$ ion, with the goal of assessing its potential for use in highly accurate atomic optical clocks and search for new physics. Such clocks should combine low sensitivity to external perturbations with high sensitivity to a possible time variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. The system features two clock transitions. One is an $f-p$ transition in terms of single-electron states, which exhibits strong sensitivity to variations in $\alpha$. The other is an electric-quadrupole (E2) transition between states of the ground-state configuration, which can serve as an anchor transition for measuring one frequency against the other.
  All three relevant states possess very small and nearly equal static dipole polarizabilities, resulting in an extremely small blackbody-radiation shift. The quadrupole shift is also small and can be further suppressed. Altogether, Hf$^{12+}$ appears to be a highly promising candidate for both precision timekeeping and searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of atomic number density using Single Pass Absorption Spectroscopy (SPAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct measurement of the atomic number density of alkali atoms using single-pass absorption spectroscopy (SPAS). We developed our methodology based on modeling the absolute absorption spectra of warm rubidium (Rb) vapor and infer the atomic number density from SPAS measurements. The model combines the Lindblad formalism with a density matrix approach and incorporates experimentally measurable parameters such as laser beam power, laser beam diameter, and cell temperature. The framework explicitly incorporates optical pumping and transit-time broadening effects and shows excellent agreement ($&gt; 99\%$) with experimental data using rubidium vapor cells across a wide range of temperature ($293$-$343$ K), laser powers ($\sim 0.2~I_{sat}$ -$~ 2~I_{sat}$), and cell lengths ($2$-$100$ mm). To ensure accurate quantification of absolute absorption measurements through the dilute atomic vapor, we measure and subtract the dark current of the photodetectors. This dark current is recorded in the absence of any light incident on the photodetector, to obtain accurate baseline corrections. This approach ensures an accurate determination of the atomic number density, even in the weak absorption regime. It provides a suitable alternative to the high-temperature, saturation-based method for baseline correction and enables the precise determination of the atomic number density in dilute atomic vapor for quantum technology applications in communication, sensing, and metrology using miniature atomic vapor cells. Furthermore, the methodology can be extended to determine the concentration of harmful gases and gaseous pollutants in urban, rural, as well as industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Probing Short-Distance Modifications of Gravity via Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent Effects in Muonic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision spectroscopy of muonic atoms provides a powerful probe for new short-range interactions predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this work, we derive new constraints on both spin-independent and spin-dependent non-Newtonian gravity by leveraging the outstanding sensitivity of these systems. For spin-independent Yukawa-type forces, we analyze two complementary approaches: the $2S-2P$ Lamb shift in the muonic helium-4 ion and the deuteron-proton squared charge radii difference obtained from the muonic hydrogen-deuterium isotope shift. The found constraints have reached a competitive level at sub-picometer scales, with the isotope shift method yielding the most stringent bounds for interaction ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-13}\text{m}$. For spin-dependent effects, we analyze the influence of the gravitational spin-orbit coupling on the $2P_{3/2}-2P_{1/2}$ fine-structure splitting in muonic helium, establishing new limits on Post-Newtonian parameters. These bounds are shown to be more restrictive than those from other leading experimental techniques for ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-10}\text{m}$. Our findings highlight the widespread usefulness of muonic atoms in exploring new fundamental physics at short-distance scales.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Frequency Shift and Relaxation of Ground-State 3He via Metastability-Exchange Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastability-exchange collisions (MECs) lie at the heart of metastability-exchange optical pumping (MEOP) in 3He, enabling the transfer of polarization from the metastable state to the ground state, as well as the optical detection of nuclear magnetic resonance. Leveraging MECs, optically pumped 3He nuclear magnetometers have been developed since the earliest demonstrations of MEOP. However, it also induces an additional frequency shift and relaxation of the nuclear spin precession, thereby limiting the sensitivity of the magnetometer. In this work, we identify a new source of frequency shift and relaxation in the 3He nuclear spin, arising from the light shift. This effect arises from an MEC-mediated interaction between light and the nucleon spin. We develop a theoretical model to describe this light-induced effect and highlight its significance in low magnetic fields. This effect is experimentally demonstrated, and its dependence on various parameters -- including magnetic field strength, light intensity, and wavelength -- is investigated. Our result provides a better understanding of the frequency shift and relaxation of 3He spin precession under MEOP conditions. Moreover, our experiment reveals an MEC-mediated coupling between the 3He nuclear spin and light, which may indicate the feasibility of MEC-assisted optical manipulation of 3He nuclear spins at the quantum level, as proposed in several theoretical schemes.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Structures in the van der Waals Interactions of Alkali Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms are used in a wide range of applications due to their peculiar properties like strong dipolar and van der Waals interactions. The choice of Rydberg state has a huge impact on the strength and angular dependence of the interactions, and so a detailed understanding of the underlying processes and resulting properties of the interactions is therefore key to select the most suitable states for experiments. We study the van der Waals interactions in alkali-metal atoms in detail and highlight the structures which allow an understanding and exploitation of the various interaction properties. A particular theme is the identification of F\"orster resonances with $n_1 \neq n_2$, which offer interaction potentials with a wide range of properties that make them particularly interesting for experimental applications. A second theme is a focus on the underlying structures that shape the angular dependency and sign of the interactions. This understanding - instead of brute-force calculations - allows for a much simpler and more systematic search for suitable pair states. These insights can be used for the selection of tailored interaction potentials subject to experimental constraints and requirements. We use rubidium as an example species in this work and also provide data for cesium and pair states that are coupled via two- or three-photon transitions, i.e. up to $F$ states, in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the g factor of ground-state 87Sr at the parts-per-million level using co-trapped ultracold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance of optically trapped ground-state ultracold 87Sr atoms. Using a scheme in which a cloud of ultracold 87Rb is co-trapped nearby, we improve the determination of the nuclear g factor, gI , of atomic 87Sr by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching accuracy at the parts-per-million level. We achieve similar accuracy in the ratio of relevant g factors between Rb and Sr. This establishes ultracold 87Sr as an excellent linear in-vacuum magnetometer. These results are relevant for ongoing efforts towards quantum simulation, quantum computation and optical atomic clocks employing 87Sr, and these methods can also be applied to other alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Single Sr Atoms in Optical Tweezer Arrays for Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.</description>

      <title>Shortcut-to-Adiabatic Controlled-Phase Gate in Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field, without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum metrology, entangled states of many-particle systems are investigated to enhance measurement precision of the most precise clocks and field sensors. While single-parameter quantum metrology is well established, many metrological tasks require joint multiparameter estimation, which poses new conceptual challenges that have so far only been explored theoretically. We experimentally demonstrate multiparameter quantum metrology with an array of entangled atomic ensembles. By splitting a spin-squeezed ensemble, we create an atomic sensor array featuring inter-sensor entanglement that can be flexibly configured to enhance measurement precision of multiple parameters jointly. Using an optimal estimation protocol, we achieve significant gains over the standard quantum limit in key multiparameter estimation tasks, thus grounding the concept of quantum enhancement of field sensor arrays and imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>
