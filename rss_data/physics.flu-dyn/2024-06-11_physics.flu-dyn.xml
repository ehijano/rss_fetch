      <title>Subgrid moving contact line model for direct numerical simulations of bubble dynamics in pool boiling of pure fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contact line vicinity model is conceived as a subgrid model for the DNS of bubble growth in boiling. The model is based on the hydrodynamic multiscale theory and is suitable for the partial wetting case. On the smallest length scale (distance from the contact line) $\sim$ 100 nm, the interface slope is controlled by the Voinov angle. It is the static apparent contact angle (ACA) that forms due to evaporation, similarly to previous models neglecting the contact line motion. The calculation of the Voinov angle is performed with the generalized lubrication approximation and includes several nanoscale effects like those of Kelvin and Marangoni, vapor recoil, hydrodynamic slip length and interfacial kinetic resistance. It provides the finite values of the heat flux, pressure and temperature at the contact line. The dynamic ACA is obtained with the Cox-Voinov formula. The microscopic length of the Cox-Voinov formula (Voinov length) is controlled mainly by the hydrodynamic slip. The integral heat flux passing through the contact line vicinity is almost independent of the nanoscale phenomena, with the exception of the interfacial kinetic resistance and is mostly defined by the dynamic ACA. Both the dynamic ACA and the integral heat flux are the main output parameters of the subgrid model, while the local superheating and the microscopic contact angle are the main input parameters. The model is suitable for the grid sizes $\gt 1 \mu$ m.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Turbulence Producing Motions in the ABL Across a Natural Roughness Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landforms such as sand dunes act as roughness elements to Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows, triggering the development of new scales of turbulent motions. These turbulent motions, in turn, energize and kick-up sand particles, influencing sediment transport and ultimately the formation and migration of dunes -- with knock on consequences for dust emission. While feedbacks between flow and form have been studied at the scale of dunes, research has not examined how the development of an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) over the entire dune field influences sediment-transporting turbulence. Here, we deploy large-eddy simulation of an ABL encountering a natural roughness transition: the sand dunes at White Sands National Park, New Mexico. We analyze turbulence producing motions and how they change as the IBL grows over the dune field. Frequency spectrum and Reynolds shear stress profiles show that IBL thickness determines the largest scales of turbulence. More, the developing IBL enhances the frequency, magnitude and duration of sweep and ejection events -- turbulence producing motions whose peaks systematically migrate away from the wall as the IBL thickens. Because sweep and ejection events are known to drive sediment transport, our findings provide a mechanism for coupling the co-evolution of the landscape and the ABL flow over it. More broadly, our results have implications for how roughness transitions influence the transport of pollutants, particulates, heat, and moisture.</description>

      <title>Pulse propagation in the quiescent environment during direct numerical simulation of Rayleigh-Taylor instability: Solution by Bromwich contour integral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In: {\it "Three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) trigerred by acoustic excitation -- Sengupta et al. {\bf 34},054108 (2022)"} the receptivity of RTI to pressure pulses have been established. It has also been shown that at the onset of RTI these pulses are one-dimensional and the dissipation of the pressure pulses are governed by a dissipative wave equation. The propagation of these infrasonic to ultrasonic pressure pulses have been studied theoretically and numerically by a high fidelity numerical procedure in the physical plane. The numerical results are consistent with the theoretical analysis and the DNS of RTI noted above. The properties of pulse propagation in a quiescent dissipative ambience have been theoretically obtained from the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equation, without Stokes' hypothesis. This analysis is extended here for a special class of excitation, with combination of wavenumbers and circular frequencies for which the phase shift results in an imposed time period is integral multiple of $\pi$, and the signal amplification is by a real factor. Here, the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the free-field propagation of pulses is solved by the Bromwich contour integral method in the spectral plane. This method, for an input Gaussian pulse excited at a fixed frequency, is the so-called signal problem. Responses for the specific phase shifts integral multiple of $\pi$ can reinforce each other due to the phase coherence. It is shown that these combinations occur at a fixed wavenumber, with higher frequencies attenuated more in such a sequence.</description>

      <title>Control of Microparticles Through Hydrodynamic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The controllability of passive microparticles that are advected with the fluid flow generated by an actively controlled one is studied. The particles are assumed to be suspended in a viscous fluid and well separated so that the far-field Stokes flow solutions may be used to describe their interactions. Applying concepts from geometric control theory, explicit moves characterized by a small amplitude parameter $\varepsilon$ are devised to prove that the active particle can control one or two passive particles. The leading-order (in $\varepsilon$) theoretical predictions of the particle displacements are compared with those obtained numerically and it is found that the discrepancy is small even when $\varepsilon\approx 1$. These results demonstrate the potential for a single actuated particle to perform complex micromanipulations of passive particles in a suspension.</description>

      <title>Revisit to the WGVC schemes: a nonlinear order-preserving and spectral-property-optimized methodology and its enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of supersonic complex flow problems demands capabilities in identifying multiscale structures and capturing shocks, imposing stringent requirements on the numerical scheme. The capability to identify multiscale structures is closely related to the spectral properties of the numerical scheme. Currently, existing methods to improve the spectral properties of finite difference schemes face shortcomings such as parallel difficulties (compact methods) or introducing unnecessary dispersion errors at low wavenumbers due to accuracy loss (spectral-like optimization methods). In this paper, we proposed an order-preserving spectral properties optimization method based on the group velocity control theory: the weighted group velocity control (WGVC) scheme. This method, centered around the concept of group velocity, achieves low-wavenumber accuracy control and mid-wavenumber group velocity control by designing smoothness indicators and nonlinear weighting approach for wave packets. Furthermore, by embedding the WGVC scheme into shock-capturing schemes such as WENO/TENO scheme, we not only preserve the spectral properties of the WGVC scheme at medium to low wavenumbers but also enhance the shock-capturing capability of the scheme. Theoretical and numerical experiments verify that the new method has advantages such as order-preserving, small dispersion and dissipation errors, and is very suitable for numerical simulation of complex flow problems such as turbulence-shock boundary layer interactions.</description>

      <title>Low-cost wind turbine aeroacoustic predictions using actuator lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerodynamic noise is a limitation for further exploitation of wind energy resources. As this type of noise is caused by the interaction of turbulent flow with the airframe, a detailed resolution of the flow is necessary to obtain an accurate prediction of the far-field noise. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) solvers simulate the flow field but only at a high computational cost, which is much increased when the acoustic field is resolved. Therefore, wind turbine noise predictions using numerical approaches remain a challenge. This paper presents a methodology that couples (relatively fast) wind turbine CFD simulations using actuator lines with a fast turn-around noise prediction method. The flow field is simulated using actuator lines and large eddy simulations. The noise prediction method is based on the Amiet-Schlinker's theory for rotatory noise sources, considering leading- and trailing-edge noise as unique noise sources. A 2D panel code (XFOIL) calculates the sectional forces and boundary layer quantities. The resulting methodology for the noise prediction method is of high fidelity since the wind turbine geometry is accounted for in both flow and acoustics predictions. Results are compared with field measurements of a full-scale wind turbine for two operational conditions, validating the results of this research.</description>

      <title>Focusing of concentric free-surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravito-capillary waves at free-surfaces are ubiquitous in several natural and industrial processes involving quiescent liquid pools bounded by cylindrical walls. These waves emanate from the relaxation of initial interface distortions, which often take the form of a cavity (depression) centred on the symmetry axis of the container. These surface waves reflect from the container walls leading to a radially inward propagating wave-train converging (focussing) onto the symmetry axis. Under the inviscid approximation and for sufficiently shallow cavities, the relaxation is well-described by the linearised potential-flow equations. Naturally, adding viscosity to such a system introduces viscous dissipation that enervates energy and dampens the oscillations at the symmetry axis.
  However, for viscous liquids and deeper cavities, these equations are qualitatively inaccurate. In this study, we elucidate a modal approach to study the initial-value problem for concentric gravito-capillary waves generated on a free-surface for inviscid as well as viscous liquids. For a sufficiently deep cavity, the inward focusing of waves results in large interfacial oscillations at the axis, necessitating a second-order nonlinear theory. We demonstrate that this theory effectively models the interfacial behavior and highlights the crucial role of nonlinearity near the symmetry axis. Contrary to expectations, the addition of slight viscosity further intensifies the oscillations at the symmetry axis. This finding underscores the limitations of the potential flow model and suggests avenues for more accurate modelling of such complex free-surface flows.</description>

      <title>Large Eddy Simulations of Flow over Additively Manufactured Surfaces: Impact of Roughness and Skewness on Turbulent Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing creates surfaces with random roughness, impacting heat transfer and pressure loss differently than traditional sand-grain roughness. We conducted high-fidelity heat transfer simulations over three-dimensional additive manufactured surfaces with varying roughness heights and skewness. Based on an additive manufactured Inconel 939 sample from Siemens Energy AB, we created six surfaces with different normalized roughness heights, $R_a/D = 0.001, 0.006, 0.012, 0.015, 0.020,$ and $0.028$, and a fixed skewness, ${s_k} = 0.424$. Each surface was also flipped to obtain negatively skewed counterparts (${s_k} = -0.424)$. Simulations were conducted at a constant Reynolds number of 8000 and with temperature treated as a passive scalar. We analyzed temperature, velocity profiles and heat fluxes to understand the impact of roughness height and skewness on heat and momentum transfer. The inner-scaled mean temperature profiles are of larger magnitude than the mean velocity profiles both inside and outside the roughness layer. This means the temperature wall roughness function differs from the momentum wall roughness function. Surfaces with positive and negative skewness yielded different estimates of equivalent sand-grain roughness for the same $R_a/D$ values, suggesting a strong influence of slope and skewness on the relationship between roughness function and equivalent sand-grain roughness. Analysis of the heat and momentum transfer mechanisms indicated an increased effective Prandtl number within the rough surface in which the momentum diffusivity is larger than the corresponding thermal diffusivity due to the combined effects of turbulence and dispersion. Results consistently indicated improved heat transfer with increasing roughness height and positively skewed surfaces performing better beyond a certain roughness threshold than negatively skewed ones.</description>

      <title>Structure and energy transfer in homogeneous turbulence below a free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the turbulence below a quasi-flat free surface, focusing on the energy transport in space and across scales. We leverage a large zero-mean-flow tank where homogeneous turbulence is generated by randomly actuated jets. A wide range of Reynolds number is spanned, reaching sufficient scale separation for the emergence of an inertial sub-range. Unlike previous studies, the forcing extends through the source layer, though the surface deformation remains millimetric. Particle image velocimetry along a surface-normal plane resolves from the dissipative to the integral scales. Both vertical and horizontal components of the turbulent kinetic energy approach the prediction based on rapid distortion theory as the Reynolds number is increased, indicating that discrepancies among previous studies are likely due to differences in the forcing. At odds with the theory, however, the integral scale of the horizontal fluctuations grows as the surface is approached. This is rooted in the profound influence exerted by the surface on the inter-scale energy transfer: along horizontal separations, the direct cascade of horizontal energy is hindered, while an inverse cascade of vertical energy is established. This is connected to the structure of upwellings and downwellings. The former, characterized by somewhat larger spatial extent and stronger intensity, are associated to extensional surface-parallel motions. They thus transfer energy to the larger horizontal scales, prevailing over downwellings which favour the compression (and concurrent vertical stretching) of the eddies. Both types of structures extend to depths between the integral and Taylor microscales.</description>

      <title>From yield stress to elastic instabilities: Tuning the extensional behavior of elastoviscoplastic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we delve into the intricacies of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids, particularly focusing on how polymer additives influence their extensional behavior. Our findings reveal that polymer additives significantly alter the extensional properties of the EVP fluids, such as relaxation time and extensional stresses, while having negligible impact on the shear rheology. Interestingly, the modified fluids exhibit a transition from yield stress-like behavior to viscoelastic-like behavior under high extensional rates, ultimately leading to destabilization under extreme deformation. This research enhances the fundamental understanding of EVP fluids and highlights potential advancements in applications, especially in precision-demanding fields like 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spectra of 2D inertial gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves without relying on the hydrostatic approximation. This spectrum is an exact solution of the kinetic equation after the shear modes are removed, and it agrees with the oceanic Garrett-Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. Among a continuous family of solutions to the kinetic equation, we show that the turbulent solution is the special solution with non zero angular dependent radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight of how turbulent energy cascade proceeds in anisotropic systems - similarly to isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of fibres prefers the chaos of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of fibres, modelled as a sequence of inertial beads linked via elastic springs, in turbulent flows is dictated by a non-trivial interplay of their inertia and elasticity. Such elastic, inertial fibres preferentially sample a three-dimensional turbulent flow in a manner qualitatively similar to that in two-dimensions [Singh et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 053105 (2020)]. Inertia and elasticity have competing effects on fibre dynamics: Inertia drives fibres away from vortices while elasticity tends to trap them inside. However, both these effects are reversed at large values. A large inertia makes the fibres sample the flow more uniformly while a very large elasticity facilitates the sampling of straining regions. This complex sampling behaviour is further corroborated by quantifying the chaotic nature of sampled flow regions. This is achieved by evaluating the maximal Lagrangian Lyapunov Exponents associated with the flow along fibre trajectories.</description>

      <title>Study on Kelvin Helmholtz shear flows subjected to differential rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) in parallel shear flows subjected to external rotation is carried out using a pseudo-spectral technique. The Coriolis force, arising in a rotation frame under the beta plane approximation, tends to suppress the growth of KHI modes. The numerical results show a close qualitative agreement with the analytical results obtained for a step-wise shear flow profile. Experimental evidence demonstrates that particles in a rotating frame experience the Coriolis force, mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz force. Therefore, the Coriolis force affects fluid dynamics in a manner similar to the Lorentz force in magnetized shear flows. This paper exploits the analogy between the magnetic field and rotation to study effects equivalent to a magnetic field on KHI in a rotating frame. Similar to the magnetic field case, the Coriolis force suppresses KHI and tends to form compressed and elongated KH vortex structures. However, the magnetic field and Coriolis force act on different scales, with the latter suppressing long-wavelength mode perturbations. A higher number of vortices are observed in the presence of rotation compared to non-rotating cases</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Draining vortices with a free surface are frequently employed as rotating black hole simulators, both in theory and experiments. However, most theoretical work is restricted to the idealised regime, where wave dispersion and dissipation are neglected. We investigate the role of these effects on the analogue black hole bomb, an instability resulting from rotational superradiant amplification in confined systems. We reveal that the dispersion of deep water capillary-gravity waves significantly modifies the unstable mode eigenfrequencies, whereas viscosity only affects those with high frequencies. Furthermore, if the circulation is less than an order 1 multiple of the drain rate, superradiance does not occur and the vortex is stable. The instability is maximised in small systems with high flow velocities, provided there is sufficient space between the vortex and the outer boundary for the first excited state to lie inside the superradiant bandwidth. Implications for experiments on analogue black holes and free surface vortices are discussed.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driven transport of thin Bingham fluid layers in airway bifurcations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11084v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mucus on the bronchial wall forms a thin layer of non-Newtonian fluid. One of the roles of mucus is to protect the lungs by capturing inhaled pollutants. It is transported by mucocilliary clearance toward the tracheo-pharyngeal bifurcation, where it is eliminated. Due to the corrugation of its interface with air, the mucus layer is subject to surface tension forces that interact with its rheology. It is still not clear whether these forces can affect mucus displacement and, if they can, under what conditions and how this displacement can occur. In this work, we model the mucus as a thin Bingham fluid layer located on the wall of idealized, multi-scaled airway bifurcations. We analyze the resulting physical system using lubrication theory and 3D simulations. The theoretical analysis allows us to characterize the nonlinear behavior of the system and determine the geometric conditions under which the Bingham fluid can be moved by surface tension. 3D simulations are then used to quantify the effects in idealized airway bifurcations on a range of scales corresponding to those of bronchial bifurcations. Our results suggest that surface tension effects can displace overly thick mucus layers in airway bifurcations, a typical situation in obstructive lung pathologies (asthma, BPCO, cystic fobrosis, etc.). Moreover, our results indicate that this movement can disrupt mucociliary clearance and the homogeneity of the layer thickness, thus increasing the risk of lung infection.</description>

      <title>Influence of adversarial training on super-resolution turbulence reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Supervised super-resolution deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential in reconstructing velocity and scalar fields in turbulent flows. Despite their popularity, CNNs currently lack the ability to accurately produce high-frequency and small-scale features, and tests of their generalizability to out-of-sample flows are not widespread. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of two distinct neural networks (NNs), a generator and discriminator, are a promising alternative, allowing for both semi-supervised and unsupervised training. The difference in the flow fields produced by these two NN architectures has not been thoroughly investigated, and a comprehensive understanding of the discriminator's role has yet to be developed. This study assesses the effectiveness of the unsupervised adversarial training in GANs for turbulence reconstruction in forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. GAN-based architectures are found to outperform supervised CNNs for turbulent flow reconstruction for in-sample cases. The reconstruction accuracy of both architectures diminishes for out-of-sample cases, though the GAN's discriminator network significantly improves the generator's out-of-sample robustness using either an additional unsupervised training step with large eddy simulation input fields and a dynamic selection of the most suitable upsampling factor. These enhance the generator's ability to reconstruct small-scale gradients, turbulence intermittency, and velocity-gradient probability density functions. The extrapolation capability of the GAN-based model is demonstrated for out-of-sample flows at higher Reynolds numbers. Based on these findings, incorporating discriminator-based training is recommended to enhance the reconstruction capability of super-resolution CNNs.</description>

      <title>Effect of polydispersity on the transport and sound absorbing properties of three-dimensional random fibrous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A technique is proposed that uses a multi-scale approach to calculate transport properties of compressed felts using only image analysis and numerical calculations. From the image analysis fiber diameter distribution and fiber orientation are determined. From a known porosity and the latter two characteristics, two representative elementary volumes (REV) are constructed: one based on the volume-weighted average diameter and one on an inverse volume-weighted average diameter. Numerical calculations on the former showed that it correctly estimates viscous and thermal permeabilities, while the latter correctly estimates tortuosity and viscous and thermal characteristic lengths. From these calculations, micro-macro analytical expressions are developed to estimate the transport properties of polydisperse composite felts based solely on open porosity, fiber diameter polydiversity, and fiber orientation. Good agreements are obtained between analytical predictions and measurements of transport properties. The predicted transport properties are also used in the Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Lafarge (JCAL) equivalent fluid model to predict the sound absorption coefficient of the felts. Excellent agreements are obtained with impedance tube measurements.</description>

      <title>A continuous data assimilation closure for modeling statistically steady turbulence in large-eddy simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closure model is presented for large-eddy simulation (LES) based on the three-dimensional variational data assimilation algorithm. The approach aims at reconstructing high-fidelity kinetic energy spectra in coarse numerical simulations by including feedback control to represent unresolved dynamics interactions in the flow as stochastic processes. The forcing uses statistics obtained from offline high-fidelity data and requires only few parameters compared to the number of degrees of freedom of LES. This modeling strategy is applied to geostrophic turbulence on the sphere and enables simulating indefinitely at reduced costs. It proves to accurately recover the energy spectra and the zonal velocity profiles in the coarse model, for three generic situations.</description>

      <title>Internal heating profiles for which downward conduction is impossible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an internally heated fluid between parallel plates with fixed thermal fluxes. For a large class of heat sources that vary in the direction of gravity, we prove that $\langle\delta T \rangle_h \geq \sigma R^{-1/3} - \mu$, where $\langle\delta T \rangle_h$ is the average temperature difference between the bottom and top plates, $R$ is a `flux' Rayleigh number and the constants $\sigma,\mu &gt;0$ depend on the geometric properties of the internal heating. This result implies that mean downward conduction (for which $\langle\delta T \rangle_h&lt; 0$) is impossible for a range of Rayleigh numbers smaller than a critical value $R_0$. The bound demonstrates that $R_0$ depends on the heating distribution and can be made arbitrarily large by concentrating the heating near the bottom plate. However, for any given fixed heating profile of the class we consider, the corresponding value of $R_0$ is always finite. This points to a fundamental difference between internally heated convection and its limiting case of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with fixed flux boundary conditions, for which $\langle\delta T \rangle_h$ is known to be positive for all $R$.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional turbulence above topography: condensation transition and selection of minimum enstrophy solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional flows above topography, revisiting the selective decay (or minimum-enstrophy) hypothesis of Bretherton and Haidvogel. We derive a 'condensed branch' of solutions to the variational problem where a domain-scale condensate coexists with a flow at the (smaller) scale of the topography. The condensate arises through a supercritical bifurcation as the conserved energy of the initial condition exceeds a threshold value, a prediction that we quantitatively validate using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). We then consider the forced-dissipative case, showing how weak forcing and dissipation select a single dissipative state out of the continuum of solutions to the energy-conserving system predicted by selective decay. As the forcing strength increases, the condensate arises through a supercritical bifurcation for topographic-scale forcing and through a subcritical bifurcation for domain-scale forcing, both predictions being quantitatively validated by DNS. This method provides a way of determining the equilibrated state of forced-dissipative flows based on variational approaches to the associated energy-conserving system, such as the statistical mechanics of 2D flows or selective decay.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>

      <title>Microscale physics and macroscale convective heat transfer in supercritical fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by fundamental thermodynamic efficiency considerations, an emerging trend in the energy and propulsion systems is that the working fluid operates at a pressure above the critical pressure. Energy transport is thus accompanied by dramatic and strongly nonlinear variations of thermophysical properties, which cause abnormal heat transfer behavior and non-ideal gas effects. This situation raises a crucial challenge for the heat exchanger and turbomachinery design, overall energy and exergy efficiency. We aim to provide a multi-scale overview of the flow and thermal behavior of fluid above the critical point: microscopic physics and macroscopic transport. Microscopic physics, i.e. near-critical thermophysical properties, phase transition and fluid dynamics, are introduced. A particular focus will be on the supercritical pseudo boiling process, which is a generalization of classical liquid-vapor phase transitions to non-equilibrium supercritical states. These new perspectives lead to a revised view of the state space. Further, recent results demonstrated the possibility of stable supercritical fluid interfaces without surface tension. On the macroscale, recent progress on the modeling of turbulent flow and convective heat transfer of supercritical fluids are summarized. Direct numerical simulation is able to offer insights into the physics of thermal fluids. We start with a description of fundamental fluid mechanics problems related to supercritical fluids. In addition, the heat transfer deterioration in supercritical fluids is found to be closely connected to the flow relaminarization by the non-uniform body-force. Finally, various modeling approaches such as recently developed advanced Reynolds-averaged turbulence modeling as well as machine-learning methods are summarized.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of $(1+1)$ dimensional fluid in the presence of gravitational anomaly from first order thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Considering ($1+1$)-dimensional fluid in presence of gravitational trace anomaly, as an effective description of higher-dimensional fluid, the hydrodynamics is discussed through a first order thermodynamic description. Contrary to the existing approaches which are second order in nature, the fluid velocity is identified through the auxiliary field required to describe the Polyakov action for the effective description of relevant energy-momentum tensor. The thermodynamic and fluid quantities, on a static black hole spacetime, are calculated both near the horizon as well as at the asymptotic infinity. The Unruh vacuum appears to be suitable one for the present analysis, in contrast to Israel-Hartle-Hawking vacuum which is consistent with second order description. As in anomaly cancellation approach to find the Hawking flux the Unruh vacuum is consistent with the required conditions, in reverse way we interpret this fluid description as an alternative approach to find these required conditions to calculate the same in anomaly cancellation approach.</description>

Abstract: The spreading of large viscous drops of density-matched suspensions of non-Brownian spheres on a smooth solid surface is experimentally investigated at the global drop scale. The focus is on dense suspensions with a solid volume fraction equal to or greater than $40\%$ and for drops larger than the capillary length, i.e. for which the spreading is governed by the balance of gravitational and viscous forces. Our findings indicate that all liquids exhibit a power law behaviour typical of gravity-driven dynamics, albeit with an effective suspension viscosity that is smaller than the bulk value. When the height of the drop is of the order of the particle size, the power law breaks down as the particles freeze while the contact line continues to advance.</description>

Abstract: Active fluids, such as suspensions of microswimmers, are known to self-organize into complex spatio-temporal flow patterns. An intriguing example is mesoscale turbulence, a state of dynamic vortex structures exhibiting a characteristic length scale. Here, we employ a minimal model for the effective microswimmer velocity field to explore how the turbulent state develops from regular vortex patterns when the strength of activity resp. related parameters such as nonlinear advection or polar alignment strength - is increased. First, we demonstrate analytically that the system, without any spatial constraints, develops a stationary square vortex lattice in the absence of nonlinear advection. Subsequently, we perform an extended stability analysis of this nonuniform "ground state" and uncover a linear instability, which follows from the mutual excitement and simultaneous growth of multiple perturbative modes. This extended analysis is based on linearization around an approximation of the analytical vortex lattice solution and allows us to calculate critical activity parameters. Above these critical values, the vortex lattice develops into mesoscale turbulence in numerical simulations. Utilizing the numerical approach, we uncover an extended region of hysteresis where both patterns are possible depending on the initial condition. Here, we find that turbulence persists below the instability of the vortex lattice. We further determine the stability of square vortex patterns as a function of their wavenumber and represent the results analogous to the well-known Busse balloons known from classical pattern-forming systems. Here, the region of stable periodic patterns shrinks and eventually disappears with increasing activity parameters. Our results show that the strength of activity plays a similar role for active turbulence as the Reynolds number does in driven flow exhibiting inertial turbulence.</description>

Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>
