      <title>On Interim Envy-Free Allocation Lotteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With very few exceptions, recent research in fair division has mostly focused on deterministic allocations. Deviating from this trend, we study the fairness notion of interim envy-freeness (iEF) for lotteries over allocations, which serves as a sweet spot between the too stringent notion of ex-post envy-freeness and the very weak notion of ex-ante envy-freeness. Our analysis relates iEF to other fairness notions as well, and reveals tradeoffs between iEF and efficiency. Even though several of our results apply to general fair division problems, we are particularly interested in instances with equal numbers of agents and items where allocations are perfect matchings of the items to the agents. We show how to compute iEF allocations in matching allocation instances in polynomial time, while also maximizing several efficiency objectives, even though this proves to be considerably more challenging than computing envy-free allocations. Our algorithms use efficient solutions to a novel variant of the bipartite matching problem. We also study the extension of iEF when payments to or from the agents are allowed. We present a series of results on two optimization problems, including a generalization of the classical rent division problem to random allocations.</description>

      <title>Market Design for Capacity Sharing in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a market mechanism that sets edge prices to incentivize strategic agents to efficiently share limited network capacity. In this market, agents form coalitions, with each coalition sharing a unit capacity of a selected route and making payments to cover edge prices. Our focus is on the existence and computation of market equilibrium, where challenges arise from the interdependence between coalition formation among strategic agents with heterogeneous preferences and route selection that induces a network flow under integral capacity constraints. To address this interplay between coalition formation and network capacity utilization, we introduce a novel approach based on combinatorial auction theory and network flow theory. We establish sufficient conditions on the network topology and agents' preferences that guarantee both the existence and polynomial-time computation of a market equilibrium. Additionally, we identify a particular market equilibrium that maximizes utilities for all agents and is equivalent to the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Furthermore, we extend our results to multi-period settings and general networks, showing that when the sufficient conditions are not met, an equilibrium may still exist but requires more complex, path-based pricing mechanisms that set differentiated prices based on agents' preference parameters.</description>

      <title>$Proo\varphi$: A ZKP Market Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are computationally demanding to generate. Their importance for applications like ZK-Rollups has prompted some to outsource ZKP generation to a market of specialized provers. However, existing market designs either do not fit the ZKP setting or lack formal description and analysis.
  In this work, we propose a formal ZKP market model that captures the interactions between users submitting ZKP tasks and provers competing to generate proofs. Building on this model, we introduce $Proo\varphi$, an auction-based ZKP market mechanism. We prove that $Proo\varphi$ is incentive compatible for users and provers, and budget balanced. We augment $Proo\varphi$ with system-level designs to address the practical challenges of our setting, such as Sybil attacks, misreporting of prover capacity, and collusion. We analyze our system-level designs and show how they can mitigate the various security concerns.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Counterfactual Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14778v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization is a family of algorithms of no-regret learning dynamics capable of solving large-scale imperfect information games. We propose implementing this algorithm as a series of dense and sparse matrix and vector operations, thereby making it highly parallelizable for a graphical processing unit, at a cost of higher memory usage. Our experiments show that our implementation performs up to about 244.5 times faster than OpenSpiel's Python implementation and, on an expanded set of games, up to about 114.2 times faster than OpenSpiel's C++ implementation and the speedup becomes more pronounced as the size of the game being solved grows.</description>

      <title>Resolute and symmetric mechanisms for two-sided matching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on the one-to-one two-sided matching model with two disjoint sets of agents of equal size, where each agent in a set has preferences on the agents in the other set modeled by a linear order. A matching mechanism associates a set of matchings to each preference profile; resoluteness, that is the capability to select a unique matching, and stability are important properties for a matching mechanism. The two versions of the deferred acceptance algorithm are resolute and stable matching mechanisms but they are unfair since they strongly favor one side of the market. We introduce a property for matching mechanisms that relates to fairness; such property, called symmetry, captures different levels of fairness and generalizes existing notions. We provide several possibility and impossibility results mainly involving the most general notion of symmetry, known as gender fairness, resoluteness, stability, weak Pareto optimality and minimal optimality. In particular, we prove that: resolute, gender fair matching mechanisms exist if and only if each side of the market consists of an odd number of agents; there exists no resolute, gender fair, minimally optimal matching mechanism. Those results are obtained by employing algebraic methods based on group theory, an approach not yet explored in matching theory.</description>
