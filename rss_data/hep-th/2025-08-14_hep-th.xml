      <title>Confinement, Nonlocal Observables, and Haag Duality Violation in the Algebraic Structure of 1+1-Dimensional Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive and rigorously formulated algebraic framework for investigating 1+1-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories within the paradigm of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT), building upon foundational results established for the Abelian Schwinger model. We meticulously construct a net of local observable C*-algebras, generated by gauge-invariant composite operators such as color-singlet currents and traces of non-Abelian electric fields, with the non-Abelian Gauss's law rigorously enforced as an operator constraint. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that no Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) superselection sectors carry nonzero color charge, thereby providing a precise and mathematically robust characterization of confinement in these theories. To fully capture the global gauge structure, we extend the observable net by incorporating nonlocal Wilson line operators, which encode string-like color flux configurations essential to the theory's topological properties. We further establish a structural violation of Haag duality, showing that certain operators, such as Wilson lines, reside in the commutant of a local algebra but cannot be localized within the algebra of the causal complement, a phenomenon driven by nontrivial topological degrees of freedom. By introducing regularization techniques for operator products and providing detailed derivations, we ensure mathematical precision. This nonperturbative, gauge-invariant framework not only elucidates the mechanisms of confinement and nonlocality but also lays a solid foundation for extending algebraic methods to higher-dimensional gauge theories and exploring their quantum information-theoretic implications.</description>

      <title>Strings from Almost Nothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that string theory emerges inevitably from a few simple assumptions about physical scattering. Consistency alone requires that all tree-level four-point scattering amplitudes exhibit vanishing residues at prescribed values of the momentum transfer. Assuming ultrasoft high-energy behavior, we then prove that the space of minimally consistent amplitudes, whose residues exhibit these mandated zeros and nothing more, are precisely the amplitudes of Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro, thus establishing the uniqueness of strings. Similar logic also applies to five-point scattering.</description>

      <title>Gravitational four-derivative corrections in non-relativistic heterotic supergravity and the $SO(8)$ Green-Schwarz mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first explicit construction of the four-derivative gravitational corrections to heterotic supergravity in the non-relativistic (NR) limit. By extending the Bergshoeff-de Roo identification to NR backgrounds, we obtain a finite higher-derivative completion of the NR heterotic action and determine its full set of symmetry transformations. A key outcome is the emergence of a gravitational $SO(8)$ Green-Schwarz mechanism from the NR gauge transformation of the Kalb-Ramond field. This mechanism can be trivialized through suitable field redefinitions, in agreement with a previous analysis of this transformation. Our results establish a systematic framework for incorporating higher-curvature gravitational dynamics into NR string heterotic backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Solvable Models of Heat Transport in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate solvable models of heat transport between a pair of quantum mechanical systems initialized at two different temperatures. At time $t=0$, a weak interaction is switched on between the systems, and we study the resulting energy transport. Focusing on the heat current as the primary observable, we analyze both the transient dynamics and the long-time behavior of the system. We demonstrate that simple toy models - including Random Matrix Theory like models ({\it RMT models}) and Schwarzian like models ({\it conformal models}) - can capture many generic features of heat transport, such as transient current peaks and the emergence of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). For these models, we derive a variety of exact results characterizing the short time transients, long time approach to NESS and thermal conductivity. Finally, we show how these features appear in a more realistic solvable model, the Double-Scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. We demonstrate that the DSSYK model interpolates between the seemingly distinct toy models discussed earlier, with the toy models in turn providing a useful lens through which to understand the rich features of DSSYK.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-invertible chiral symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the chiral symmetry of the Standard Model is not explicitly broken by its ABJ anomaly, but is instead made non-invertible. In this work, I quantify the breaking of non-invertible symmetries of this type by calculating the symmetry breaking scales and effective charges $q(r)$ originally studied for continuous invertible higher-form symmetries. As an example I consider the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry of massless QED by introducing Yukawa couplings between the electron and a massive real scalar in the UV. I briefly comment on how one might quantify the breaking of general non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to scale with system size.</description>

      <title>Can a $\xi R \phi^2$ non-minimal coupling contribute to the non-relativistic gravitational potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of the $\sqrt{-g}\xi R\phi^2$ non-minimal interaction for a massive scalar to the gravitational potential, found via the non-relativistic 2-2 scattering with one and two graviton exchanges up to one loop order. Such coupling can be most naturally motivated from the renormalisation of a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction in a curved spacetime. This coupling is qualitatively different from the minimal ones, like $\sim \sqrt{G} h^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu}$, as the vertices corresponding to the former does not explicitly contain any scalar momenta, but instead explicitly contains the momentum of the graviton. We show that the insertion of one/two graviton-two scalar non-minimal vertices in the standard 2-2 scattering Feynman diagrams does not yield any contribution for the potential up to one loop, owing to the aforesaid explicit appearance of graviton's transfer momentum in the numerator of the Feynman amplitude. In order to complement this effect, the most natural choice seems to consider the three graviton vertex generated by the $\sim \Lambda \sqrt{-g}/G$ term in the action, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant. This vertex does not contain explicitly any graviton momentum. With this, and assuming short scale scattering much small compared to the Hubble horizon, we compute the seagull, the vacuum polarisation and the fish diagrams and obtain the non-relativistic scattering amplitudes. They indeed yield a two body gravitational potential at order $\xi \Lambda G^2$. We further point out some qualitative differences of this potential with that of the standard result of $\xi =0$.</description>

      <title>On the Replica Problem in Supersymmetric SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the replica problem for Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. First, we consider $n-$replicas of the non-supersymmetric SYK model, finding that this $n$-replica model is solvable only under specific conditions. We then introduce the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and utilize the superconformal symmetry to develop a ``multi-ordered trick" that covers the replica structure. By incorporating ordered off-diagonal couplings, we study the resulting thermal phase structure under higher-order interactions. The Lorentzian time dynamics is analyzed, and we plot the time evolution of the effective action. Furthermore, we investigate emergent superconformal symmetry in the low-energy limit of the replicated theory. In the superconformal limit, we propose an ordered super-Schwarzian action and derive reparameterization relations for the ordered coordinates. Corresponding constraints are derived for holographic matching to $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Jackiw-Teitelboim(SJT) gravity. We numerically calculate the modular thermodynamics (modular entropy, the $n$-dependent relative entropy, and the entanglement capacity) using fully diagonal methods. Our result provide a framework for studying $n$-replica wormholes with supersymmetric SYK model.</description>

      <title>Gravity Is Induced By Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic renormalization group (RG) setting in which a 4-dimensional ($4d$) quantum field theory at a finite cutoff corresponds to/is described by the Einstein gravity on a part of AdS$_{5}$ space, cutoff at a finite radius. This holographic setting has interesting and important implications for the $4d$ field theory: Deformation of the field theory by a certain combination involving the square of its energy-momentum tensor can be alternatively viewed as formulating the field theory on a background with a dynamical metric. Explicitly, starting with a non-gravitating $4d$ field theory in the UV, flowing to the IR, quantum effects that we compute using the classical $5d$ Einstein gravity theory, induce an effective $4d$ Einstein gravity theory. In other words, we show that gravity is not a fundamental force and is an effective description of quantum effects in the IR limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an analogue of Yang--Baxter deformations defined by a single Killing vector, that is a solution generating transformation in Einstein--Maxwell dilaton theory. We show that these are nothing but a coordinate transformation in a parent theory related to EMd theory by KK reduction. Similarly (almost-abelian) bi-vector Yang--Baxter deformations are coordinate transformations in the doubled space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of variational neural network quantum states to study non-stabilizerness in qubit-regularised quantum field theory. Applying the methodology recently introduced by Sinibaldi et al., we numerically compute the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy of ground states of the Schwinger model with a topological term. We examine how the magic content of these states depends on the separation between external probe charges, providing insight into the classical hardness of simulating gauge theories with non-trivial infrared structure.</description>

      <title>Trapping, chaos and averaging in bubbling AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained (grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loop equation satisfied by Wilson's loops in QCD is reformulated as a functional Laplace equation. Discretizing the loop space by polygons, Green's function of the functional Laplacian is represented as a path integral of the Euclidean harmonic oscillator and is applied for an iterative solution of the equation. It is shown how the usual Feynman's diagrams are reproduced through order $(g^2N)^2$ including the one with the three-gluon vertex.</description>

      <title>Quivers and BPS states in 3d and 4d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a symmetrization relation between BPS quivers encoding 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and symmetric quivers associated to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. We analyse in detail the symmetrization of BPS quivers for a series of $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories by engineering 3d-4d systems in geometric backgrounds involving appropriate 3-manifolds and Riemann surfaces. We discuss properties of these geometric backgrounds and derive the corresponding quiver partition functions from the perspective of skein modules, which forms the foundation of the symmetrization map for the minimal chamber. We also prove that the structure of wall-crossing in 4d $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories is isomorphic to the structure of unlinking of symmetric quivers encoding their partner 3d theories, which allows for a proper definition of the symmetrization map outside the minimal chamber. Finally, we show that the Schur indices of 4d theories are captured by symmetric quivers that include symmetrization of 4d BPS quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open- and closed-string three- and four-point one-loop amplitudes involving massless states and one first-level massive state are computed in pure spinor superspace. For the open string, we show that their one-loop correlators can be rewritten in terms of tree-level kinematic factors. We then analyze the closed string. For three points, this is immediate. For four points, we show that it is possible to rewrite the one-loop closed-string correlator using tree-level kinematic factors, but only for certain combinations of massive and massless states (different for type IIA and IIB).</description>

      <title>Extremal curves in single-trace $T\bar{T}$-holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of single-trace $T\bar{T}$-holography where the boundary field theory can be realized as a CFT$_2$ deformed by a single-trace irrelevant operator of dimension $(2,2)$ and dual spacetime geometry is $AdS_3$ smoothly glued to flat spacetime with a linear dilaton near the boundary. In this non-AdS holographic framework, we propose that the length of real extremal curves connecting the two boundaries of an eternal black hole at fixed boundary time captures the time-evolved entanglement entropy of an entangled, quenched boundary system. At late times, we find two analytic extremal solutions in the complexified geometry, which become real in complementary temperature regimes. Focusing only on the real solutions leads to a non-analyticity at a critical temperature $T_c$, which we interpret as a second-order phase transition separating a local (CFT$_2$) phase from a non-local (Little String Theory) phase.</description>

      <title>On continuum and resonant spectra from exact WKB analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonance phenomena are central to many quantum systems, where resonant states are typically described by pole singularities of S-matrix. In this work, we apply the complex scaling method (CSM) and exact WKB analysis to describe scattering problems, incorporating both bound and resonant states. We compute continuum spectrum based on the exact WKB analysis and derive the S-matrix for the inverted Rosen--Morse potential. We reinterpret the Aguilar--Balslev--Combes theorem, on which CSM is based; we then discuss the physical significance of the Siegert boundary condition and rigorously define physical states in a modified Hilbert space. Our analysis connects the scattering cross-section and spectral theory, providing insights into the scattering theory and related formulas.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of average subsystem Bures distance in transverse field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average subsystem trace distance has been proposed as an indicator of quantum many-body chaos and integrability. In integrable systems, evaluating the trace distance faces two challenges: the computational cost for large systems and ambiguities in defining and ordering eigenstates. In this paper, we calculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field Ising chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance between two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To address the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate states. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem size. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average subsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem from discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in integrable systems. Additionally, we investigate the average subsystem distances between random pure Gaussian states but do not observe a linear increase.</description>

      <title>Instant Folded Strings, Dark Energy and a Cyclic Bouncing Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based on components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under perturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the string scale and string coupling $g_s \ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a second field that becomes massless at $\phi= \phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs) - fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing and Hawking spectra of charged black hole under Lorentz violation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-like black hole (RN-like BH) in bumblebee gravity. We calculate the lensing quantities such as deflection angle, radius of the photon sphere, angular separation, relativistic image characteristics, Einstein ring and time delay. By taking the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) like Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1332, NGC 4649 etc. as RN-like BH, we compute the lensing observables and compare with the observables associated with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (RNBH). The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-de Sitter-like (RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and imaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$. It shows the damping rate and the oscillation frequency decrease with increasing $L$ but it has the opposite effect for the increase of $Q$. We further explore the detectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on the detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody factor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability of wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the increase of $Q$. The behaviour of absorption cross section and sparsity of Hawking radiation for different values of $L$ and $Q$ are also analysed graphically.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Inflation with Interacting Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful tool to calculate the cosmological correlators non-perturbatively. However, it requires the initial data for the amplitude of the noise on the initial flat hypersurface which for a free theory during inflation is fixed to be $\frac{H}{2 \pi}$. In this work, we study the setups where the underlying theory involves interactions and the stochastic noises inherit these interactions. We extend the stochastic $\delta N$ formalism to these setups and rewrite the corresponding Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations in which the QFT corrections in the amplitude of the noises are taken into account. As an example, in the three-phase SR-USR-SR setup which is employed for PBHs formation, the modification in the amplitude of noise is calculated from the one-loop corrections in power spectrum via in-in formalism. We show that in these setups the amplitude of the stochastic noise is modified to $\frac{H}{2 \pi} \Big(1+ \frac{ \Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{ {\cal R} } }\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in which $ \frac{\Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{{\cal R} } }$ is the fractional one-loop correction in power spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant in the presence of a finite size boundary, $\Gamma$, for both Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. As our boundary condition, we consider the `conformal' boundary condition that fixes the conformal class of the induced metric at $\Gamma$ and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, $K(x^m)$. In Lorentzian signature, we must supplement these with appropriate initial data comprising the standard Cauchy data along a spatial slice and, in addition, initial data for a boundary mode that appears due to the presence of the finite size boundary. We perform a linearised analysis of the gravitational field equations for both an $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ as well as a Minkowskian, $\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$, boundary. In the $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ case, in addition to the usual AdS$_4$ normal modes, we uncover a novel linearised perturbation, $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$, which can exhibit complex frequencies at sufficiently large angular momentum. Upon moving $\Gamma$ toward the infinite asymptotic AdS$_4$ boundary, the complex frequencies appear at increasingly large angular momentum and vanish altogether in the strict limit. In the $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ case, although we uncover an analogous novel perturbation, we show it does not exhibit complex frequencies. In Euclidean signature, we show that $K(x^m)$ plays the role of a source for $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$. When close to the AdS$_4$ asymptotic boundary, we speculate on the holographic interpretation of $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$.</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories, and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions, we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order, which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760, closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

      <title>Conservative Dynamics of Relativistic Binaries Beyond Einstein Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conservative dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general effective theory of gravity which includes a metric and an arbitrary number of scalar fields, through $\mathcal{O}(G^{3})$. Departures from Einstein gravity, which preserve general coordinate and local Lorentz invariance, are characterized by higher-derivative terms in a Lagrangian whose coupling constants scale as powers of a ``new-physics'' length scale, $\ell$. For a purely metric theory we compute the contributions from the the leading and subleading higher-curvature curvature corrections. In four dimensions these are cubic and quartic curvature terms, i.e. orders $\ell^4$ and $\ell^6$. We also study a general multi-scalar-tensor theory of gravity to order $\ell^{4}$, which includes both Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) higher-order couplings. Specifically, we compute the radial action in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop order. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact objects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital observables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping post-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Atom in a Fuzzy Spherical Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fuzzy onion model formed by connecting a set of concentric fuzzy spheres of increasing radius is motivated by studies of quantum space but can also be used to study standard physics. The main feature of the model is that functions in three-dimensional space -- like scalar fields or wavefunctions -- are expressed in terms of Hermitian matrices of a certain structure. Relevant equations are then matrix equations, and some problems, such as searching for the energy spectrum for fixed quantum numbers $(l,m)$, can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem. We show how this simple approach can reproduce the results of other studies analyzing the hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity. We also test the effect of the short-distance quantum structure of the space on these solutions -- not looking for the phenomenological consequences, as the scale of quantum space is many orders below the order of the Bohr radius, but to understand the effect of quantum space in general. We observe a set of solutions without a classical counterpart which have been suggested also in a former theoretical study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how to obtain the symmetric orbifold fusion rule/OPE from the dual string theory. We consider two explicit examples: $k_b=3$ bosonic strings in ${\rm AdS_3}\times X$ in the near-boundary limit and $k=1$ hybrid strings in $\rm AdS_3\times S^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$. The main advantage of these two examples is that they have explicit expressions for the vertex operators in the $x$-basis. We show that the OPE of such vertex operators explicitly captures the longest cycle contribution in the symmetric orbifold fusion rule/OPE. We then argue how one can obtain the shorter-cycle contributions using the screening operators existing in the theories. We also discuss how our general result reduces to the earlier results in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intersecting D6-brane models without discrete torsion typically suffer from unstabilized open string moduli, arising from D-brane positions and Wilson lines. These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing the realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom unless they are decoupled around string scale. A viable solution involves utilizing rigid cycles, which eliminate these unwanted adjoint fields. In this work, we for the first time present a class of consistent three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from rigid intersecting D6-branes on the factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion. These models satisfy all the known consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, K-theory constraints, tadpole cancellation, and recent swampland bounds on the maximal gauge group rank. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their phenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a renormalization group (RG) flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry by interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the $\alpha'^2$ corrections to the supersymmetry algebra constructed by Bergshoeff--de Roo for heterotic compactifications on SU(3) manifolds. The geometry is complex and conformally balanced. We find an integrability condition for solutions related to the graviton equation of motion together with a correction that is pure gauge. We derive the same condition independently from hermitian geometry. The curvature of the tangent bundle connection acquires a nonzero (0,2) component and thus is not an instanton, illustrating how $\alpha'$-corrections can disrupt semi-classical intuition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity in two regimes: a) at the chiral limit where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes become null and b) in the regime that one of the two charges is much larger than the other. At the chiral point, we go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations. We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled in the neighborhood of the chiral limit, where the theory is anyway not unitary. We show that this is not the case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops, starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk Feynman diagrams. Finally, we show that there is no strong coupling problem in the second regime where, instead, the two boundary fields and the field propagating in the bulk decouple from one another.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the concept of Krylov complexity to include general unitary evolutions involving multiple generators. This generalization enables us to formulate a framework for generalized Krylov complexity, which serves as a measure of the complexity of states associated with continuous symmetries within a model. Furthermore, we investigate scenarios where different directions of transformation lead to varying degrees of complexity, which can be compared to geometric approaches to understanding complexity, such as Nielsen complexity. In this context, we introduce a generalized orthogonalization algorithm and delineate its computational framework, which is structured as a network of orthogonal blocks rather than a simple linear chain. Additionally, we provide explicit evaluations of specific illustrative examples to demonstrate the practical application of this framework.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ black holes with primary Proca hair from regularized Gauss-Bonnet coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in arXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge. As special cases, we find a regular black hole solution in addition to charged and uncharged stealth BTZ black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations, restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not a Lagrangian system as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting the dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for the original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is a particle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space acquires one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for the precession of trajectories. The second example is linearized gravity with the Einstein-Hilbert action, and the class of varying fields is restricted by the linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall dynamics from nonequilibrium quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled dynamics between the bubble wall and the plasma from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. The commonly used equation of motion of the bubble wall in the kinetic approach is shown to be incomplete. In the language of the two-particle-irreducible effective action, the conventional equation misses higher-loop terms generated by the condensate-particle type vertices (e.g.,~$\varphi\phi\chi^2$, where $\varphi$ is the background field describing the bubble wall, $\phi$ the corresponding particle excitation and $\chi$ another particle species in the plasma). From the missing terms, we identify an additional dissipative friction which is contributed by particle production processes from the condensate-particle type vertices. We also show how other transmission processes beyond the 1-to-1 elementary transmission studied in the literature for ultrarelativistic bubble walls, e.g., 1-to-1 mixing and 1-to-2 transition radiation, can be understood from the kinetic approach.</description>

      <title>Stable soliton dark matter wormhole in non-minimally coupled $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry can indeed help in constructing stable, traversable, wormholes (WHs) without requiring exotic matter under certain conditions. In models like $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})={\cal Q}+\beta {\cal T}$ gravity, where ${\cal Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar, and ${\cal T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, the coupling between matter and geometry introduces additional degrees of freedom in terms of the parameter $\beta$. These can mimic the effects of exotic matter or even replace it entirely under specific parameter choice. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on two dark matter (DM) density profiles: a solitonic core at the center of DM halos, and the outer halo follows the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile of cold DM (CDM). The wormhole solutions derived in these models satisfy important geometric conditions like: Flaring-out condition (necessary for traversability) and asymptotic flatness condition. For large positive coupling parameter, the null energy condition (NEC) can be satisfied at the wormhole throat, meaning exotic matter is not needed, while the wormhole is no longer Lorentzian and the flaring-out condition is broken. However, for large negative coupling parameter, the NEC can be satisfied, allowing for healthy wormholes without exotic matter, provided the coupling strength remains within certain bounds. In the latter case, the NEC is broken only effectively. We investigate the stability of the obtained wormhole solutions by virtue of a modified version of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which includes a new force due to matter-geometry non-minimal, showing that these wormholes can be dynamically stable.</description>
