      <title>Detecting the most probable transition phenomenon of a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population biology model holds a significant position within ecosystems. Introducing stochastic perturbations into the model can more accurately depict real biological processes. In this paper, we primarily investigate the most probable transition phenomenon in a three-dimensional nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) plankton model. With appropriate parameter values, the system coexists with a stable equilibrium point and a stable limit cycle. Under noise perturbations, transitions occur between these two steady states. Based on the Onsager-Machlup action functional and the neural shooting method, we have studied the most probable transition time, the most probable transition pathway and the most probable transition probability of the NPZ system. The transition between these metastable states plays a crucial role in stochastic ecosystems, providing guidance for a better understanding of complex biological processes.</description>

      <title>Investigating Forecasting Models for Pandemic Infections Using Heterogeneous Data Sources: A 2-year Study with COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health, economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models, enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.</description>

      <title>Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience.
  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>

      <title>Control of Overpopulated Tails in Kinetic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>
