      <title>Monomial stability of Frobenius images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study representation stability in the sense of Church, Ellenburg, and Farb \cite{FI-module} through the lens of symmetric function theory and the different symmetric function bases. We show that a sequence, \((F_n)_n\), where \(F_n\) is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree \(n\), has stabilizing Schur coefficients if and only if it has stabilizing monomial coefficients. More generally, we develop a framework for checking when stabilizing coefficients transfer from one symmetric function basis to another. We also see how one may compute representation stable ranges from the monomial expansions of the \(F_n\).\parspace
  As applications, we reprove and refine the representation stability of diagonal coinvariant algebras, \(DR_n\). We also observe new representation stability phenomena related to the modified Macdonald polynomials, \(\tilde{H}_{\mu[n]}[X;q,t]\), and prove certain stability properties of the modified \(q,t\)-Kostka numbers, \(\tilde{K}_{\mu[n],\nu[n]}(q,t)\).</description>

      <title>On a New Congruence in the Catalan Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0\leq k \leq n$, the number $C(n,k)$ represents the number of all lattice paths in the plane from the point $(0,0)$ to the point $(n,k)$, using steps $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, that never rise above the main diagonal $y=x$. The Fuss-Catalan number of order three $C^{(3)}_n$ represents the number of all lattice paths in the plane from the point $(0,0)$ to the point $(2n,n)$, using steps $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, that do not rise above the line $y=\frac{x}{2}$. We present a new alternating convolution formula for the numbers $C(2n,k)$. By using a new class of binomial sums that we call $M$ sums, we prove that this sum is divisible by $C^{(3)}_n$ and by the central binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n}$. We do this by examining the numbers $T(n,j)=\frac{1}{2n+1}\binom{2n+j}{j}\binom{2n+1}{n+j+1}$, for which we present a new combinatorial interpretation, connecting them to the generalized Schr\"{o}der numbers of order two.</description>

      <title>Defect and transference versions of the Alon-Frankl-Lovasz theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confirming a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s on the chromatic number of Kneser hypergraphs, Alon, Frankl and Lov\'asz proved that in any $q$-colouring of the edges of the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph, there exists a monochromatic matching of size $\lfloor \frac{n+q-1}{r+q-1}\rfloor$. In this paper, we prove a transference version of this theorem. More precisely, for fixed $q$ and $r$, we show that with high probability, a monochromatic matching of approximately the same size exists in any $q$-colouring of a random hypergraph, already when the average degree is a sufficiently large constant. In fact, our main new result is a defect version of the Alon--Frankl--Lov\'asz theorem for almost complete hypergraphs. From this, the transference version is obtained via a variant of the weak hypergraph regularity lemma. The proof of the defect version uses tools from extremal set theory developed in the study of the Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture.</description>

      <title>The threshold for loose Hamilton cycles in random hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that w.h.p.\ the random $r$-uniform hypergraph $H_{n,m}$ contains a loose Hamilton cycle, provided $r\geq 3$ and $m\geq \frac{(1+\epsilon)n\log n}{r}$, where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrary positive constant. This is asymptotically best possible, as if $m\leq \frac{(1-\epsilon)n\log n}{r}$ then w.h.p.\ $H_{n,m}$ contains isolated vertices.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the positive inertia index of connected signed graphs in terms of girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G^\sigma=(G,\sigma)$ be a connected signed graph and $A(G^\sigma)$ be its adjacency matrix. The positive inertia index of $G^\sigma$, denoted by $p^{+}(G^\sigma)$, is defined as the number of positive eigenvalues of $A(G^\sigma)$. Assume that $G^\sigma$ contains at least one cycle, and let $g_{r}$ be its girth. In this paper, we prove $p^{+}(G^\sigma) \geq \lceil \frac {g_{r}}{2} \rceil-1$ for a signed graph $G^\sigma$. The extremal signed graphs corresponding to $p^{+}(G^\sigma) = \lceil \frac {g_{r}}{2} \rceil-1$ and $p^{+}(G^\sigma) =\lceil \frac {g_{r}}{2} \rceil$ are characterized, respectively. The results presented in this article extend the recent work on ordinary graphs by Duan and Yang (Linear Algebra Appl., 2024) to the context of signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an problems for suspension of a balanced tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tur\'an number $\ex(n,H)$ is the maximum number of edges that an $n$-vertex $H$-free graph can have. The suspension $\widehat{H}$ is obtained from $H$ by adding a new vertex which is adjacent to all vertices of $H$ and a tree is balanced if the sizes of its two color classes differ at most $1$. In this paper, we obtain a sharp bound of $\ex(n,\widehat{T})$ when $n\ge 4(4k)^6$ based on the Erd\H{o}s-S\'os conjecture. We also show the bound is sharp for infinitely many $n$ and characterize all extremal graphs. In particular, if $T$ satisfies some conditions such as $T$ contains a matching covering all vertices in one color class, then the bound is sharp for all $n$. This is a new class of graphs whose decomposition family does not contain a linear forest but we still can determine its Tur\'an number.</description>

      <title>Density conditions for $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles in tripartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n,k$ be positive integers such that $n\geq k$ and $G$ be a tripartite graph with parts $A,B,C$ such that $|A|=|B|=|C|=n$. Denote the edge densities of $G[A,B]$, $G[A,C]$ and $G[B,C]$ by $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, respectively. In this paper, we study edge density conditions for the existence of $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles in a tripartite graph. For $n\geq 5k+2$ we give an optimal condition in terms of densities $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ for the existence of $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles in $G$. We also give an optimal condition in terms of densities $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ for the existence of a triangle-factor in $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for $ \eta&gt;0 $ and sufficiently large $ n $, every 5-graph on $ n $ vertices with $\delta_{2}(H)\ge (91/216+\eta)\binom{n}{3}$ contains a Hamilton 2-cycle. This minimum 2-degree condition is asymptotically best possible. Moreover, we give some related results on Hamilton $ \ell $-cycles with $ d $-degree for $\ell\le d \le k-1$ and $1\le \ell &lt; k/2$.</description>

Abstract: A Bier sphere is a simplicial sphere obtained as the deleted join of a simplicial complex and its combinatorial Alexander dual. We focus on particular classes of full subcomplexes of Bier spheres, and determine their topological types. As applications, we explicitly describe the cohomology of real toric spaces associated with Bier spheres.</description>

      <title>3-path-connectivity of bubble-sort star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. Let $T$ be a subset of $ V(G)$ with cardinality $|T|\geq2$. A path connecting all vertices of $T$ is called a $T$-path of $G$. Two $T$-paths $P_i$ and $P_j$ are said to be internally disjoint if $V(P_i)\cap V(P_j)=T$ and $E(P_i)\cap E(P_j)=\emptyset$. Denote by $\pi_G(T)$ the maximum number of internally disjoint $T$- paths in G. Then for an integer $\ell$ with $\ell\geq2$, the $\ell$-path-connectivity $\pi_\ell(G)$ of $G$ is formulated as $\min\{\pi_G(T)\,|\,T\subseteq V(G)$ and $|T|=\ell\}$. In this paper, we study the $3$-path-connectivity of $n$-dimensional bubble-sort star graph $BS_n$. By deeply analyzing the structure of $BS_n$, we show that $\pi_3(BS_n)=\lfloor\frac{3n}2\rfloor-3$, for any $n\geq3$.</description>

      <title>The minimum edge-pancyclic graph of a given order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ of order $n$ is called edge-pancyclic if, for every integer $k$ with $3 \leq k \leq n$, every edge of $G$ lies in a cycle of length $k$. Determining the minimum size $f(n)$ of a simple edge-pancyclic graph with $n$ vertices seems difficult. Recently, Li, Liu and Zhan \cite{li2024minimum} gave both a lower bound and an upper bound of $f(n)$. In this paper, we improve their lower bound by considering a new class of graphs and improve the upper bound by constructing a family of edge-pancyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>On graph classes with constant domination-packing ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominating number $\gamma(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum size of a vertex set whose closed neighborhood covers all the vertices of the graph. The packing number $\rho(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum size of a vertex set whose closed neighborhoods are pairwise disjoint. In this paper we study graph classes ${\cal G}$ such that $\gamma(G)/\rho(G)$ is bounded by a constant $c_{\cal G}$ for each $G\in {\cal G}$. We propose an inductive proof technique to prove that if $\cal G$ is the class of $2$-degenerate graphs, then there is such a constant bound $c_{\cal G}$. We note that this is the first monotone, dense graph class that is shown to have constant ratio. We also show that the classes of AT-free and unit-disk graphs have bounded ratio.
  In addition, our technique gives improved bounds on $c_{\cal G}$ for planar graphs, graphs of bounded treewidth or bounded twin-width. Finally, we provide some new examples of graph classes where the ratio is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two graph parameters are said to be coarsely equivalent if they are within constant factors from each other for every graph $G$. Recently, several graph parameters were shown to be coarsely equivalent to tree-length. Recall that the length of a tree-decomposition ${\cal T}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal T}(G)$, and the tree-length $tl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all tree-decompositions of $G$. Similarly, the length of a path-decomposition ${\cal P}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal P}(G)$, and the path-length $pl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all path-decompositions of $G$. In this paper, we present several graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length. Among other results, we show that the path-length of a graph $G$ is small if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is true: (a) $G$ can be embedded to an unweighted caterpillar tree (equivalently, to a graph of path-width one) with a small additive distortion; (b) there is a constant $r\ge 0$ such that for every triple of vertices $u,v,w$ of $G$, disk of radius $r$ centered at one of them intercepts all paths connecting two others; (c) $G$ has a $k$-dominating shortest path with small $k\ge 0$; (d) $G$ has a $k'$-dominating pair with small $k'\ge 0$; (e) some power $G^\mu$ of $G$ is an AT-free (or even a cocomparability) graph for a small integer $\mu\ge 0$.</description>

      <title>Splicing skew shaped positroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skew shaped positroids (or skew shaped positroid varieties) are certain Richardson varieties in the flag variety that admit a realization as explicit subvarieties of the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$. They are parametrized by a pair of Young diagrams $\mu \subseteq \lambda$ fitting inside a $k \times (n-k)$-rectangle. For every $a = 1, \dots, n-k$, we define an explicit open set $U_a$ inside the skew shaped positroid $S^{\circ}_{\lambda/\mu}$, and show that $U_a$ is isomorphic to the product of two smaller skew shaped positroids. Moreover, $U_a$ admits a natural cluster structure and the aforementioned isomorphism is quasi-cluster in the sense of Fraser. Our methods depend on realizing the skew shaped positroid as an explicit braid variety, and generalize the work of the first and third authors for open positroid cells in the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Butcher series for Hamiltonian Poisson integrators through symplectic groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pre-Lie formalism of Butcher trees for the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions on any symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G} \rightrightarrows M.$ The impact of this new algebraic approach is twofold. On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Poisson diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.</description>

      <title>A New Representation of Ewens-Pitman's Partition Structure and Its Characterization via Riordan Array Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ewens-Pitman's partition structure arises as a system of sampling consistent probability distributions on set partitions induced by the Pitman-Yor process. It is widely used in statistical applications, particularly in species sampling models in Bayesian nonparametrics. Drawing references from the area of representation theory of the infinite symmetric group, we view Ewens-Pitman's partition structure as an example of a non-extreme harmonic function on a branching graph, specifically, the Kingman graph. Taking this perspective enables us to obtain combinatorial and algebraic constructions of this distribution using the interpolation polynomial approach proposed by Borodin and Olshanski (The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, 7, 2000). We provide a new explicit representation of Ewens-Pitman's partition structure using modern umbral interpolation based on Sheffer polynomial sequences. In addition, we show that a certain type of marginals of this distribution can be computed using weighted row sums of a Riordan array. In this way, we show that some summary statistics and estimators derived from Ewens-Pitman's partition structure can be obtained using methods of generating functions. This approach simplifies otherwise cumbersome calculations of these quantities often involving various special combinatorial functions. In addition, it has the added benefit of being amenable to symbolic computation.</description>

      <title>Moment conditions for the asymptotic completeness of iid gap sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conditions under which integer sequences with independent, identically distributed gaps are asymptotically $k$-complete, meaning that every sufficiently large integer can be represented as the sum of exactly $k$ distinct elements of the sequence, or equivalently whether $k$-fold sumsets with distinct entries from such sequences generate all sufficiently large integers. Prior results established asymptotic completeness under strong conditions on the gap distribution involving the moment generating function. Leveraging renewal theory our main result shows that asymptotic $2$-completeness holds almost surely under the much weaker assumption of a finite second moment. Furthermore, using Schnirelmann densities and Mann's theorem we show weak asymptotic $k$-completeness under only a finite first moment condition, albeit with an upper bound on the first moment.</description>

      <title>Upper tail bounds for irregular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we consider the upper tail large deviations of subgraph counts for irregular graphs $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$, the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph on $n$ vertices with edge connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$. For $n^{-1/\Delta} \ll p \ll 1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $\mathrm{H}$, we derive the upper tail large deviations for any irregular graph $\mathrm{H}$. On the other hand, we show that for $p$ such that $1 \ll n^{v_\mathrm{H}} p^{e_\mathrm{H}} \ll (\log n)^{\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}/\left(\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}-1\right)}$, where $v_\mathrm{H}$ and $e_\mathrm{H}$ denote the number of vertices and edges of $\mathrm{H}$, and $\alpha^*_{\mathrm{H}}$ denotes the fractional independence number, the upper tail large deviations of the number of unlabelled copies of $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ is given by that of a sequence of Poisson random variables with diverging mean. Restricting to the $r$-armed star graph we further prove a localized behavior in the intermediate range of $p$ (left open by the above two results) and show that the mean-field approximation is asymptotically tight for the logarithm of the upper tail probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fixed number of passengers independently board one of several buses uniformly at random. The lonely passenger problem is to prove that the probability of at least one passenger being the only one in their bus is increasing in the number of buses. It was solved in a strong form by Imre P\'eter T\'oth, who proved stochastic dominance of the number of such passengers as the number of buses increases, but observed that, surprisingly, no short proof was known ``despite the efforts of several experts''. We give a very short proof of the weaker result. The proof of the strong form, using the same idea, is more involved but still relatively short.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the size of the largest connected component in a subcritical inhomogeneous random graph with a kernel of preferential attachment type. The component grows polynomially in the network size with an explicitly given exponent, which is strictly larger than the growth exponent of the largest degree in the network. This is in stark contrast to the behaviour of inhomogeneous random graphs with a kernel of rank one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the problem of finding paths in Cayley graphs of groups and group actions, using the Rubik's cube as an example, and we list several more examples of significant mathematical interest. We then show how to formulate these problems in the framework of diffusion models. The exploration of the graph is carried out by the forward process, while finding the target nodes is done by the inverse backward process. This systematizes the discussion and suggests many generalizations. To improve exploration, we propose a ``reversed score'' ansatz which substantially improves over previous comparable algorithms.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions IX. Grid theorem for perforated graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa Theorem, in one formulation, asserts that for every $c\geq 1$, graphs with no subgraph (or equivalently, minor) isomorphic to the disjoint union of $c$ cycles have bounded treewidth. What can we say about the treewidth of graphs containing no induced subgraph isomorphic to the disjoint union of $c$ cycles?
  Let us call these graphs $c$-perforated. While $1$-perforated graphs have treewidth one, complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs are examples of $2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. But there are sparse examples, too: Bonamy, Bonnet, D\'{e}pr\'{e}s, Esperet, Geniet, Hilaire, Thomass\'{e} and Wesolek constructed $2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth and no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_3$ or $K_{3,3}$; we call these graphs occultations. Indeed, it turns out that a mild (and inevitable) adjustment of occultations provides examples of $2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth and arbitrarily large girth, which we refer to as full occultations.
  Our main result shows that the converse also holds: for every $c\geq 1$, a $c$-perforated graph has large treewidth if and only if it contains, as an induced subgraph, either a large complete graph, or a large complete bipartite graph, or a large full occultation. This distinguishes $c$-perforated graphs, among graph classes purely defined by forbidden induced subgraphs, as the first to admit a grid-type theorem incorporating obstructions other than subdivided walls and their line graphs.
  More generally, for all $c,o\geq 1$, we establish a full characterization of induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth in graphs containing no induced subgraph isomorphic to the disjoint union of $c$ cycles, each of length at least $o+2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new invariant of a cubic graph - its regular colouring defect - which is defined as the smallest number of edges left uncovered by any collection of three perfect matchings that have no edge in common. This invariant is a modification of colouring defect, an invariant introduced by Steffen (J. Graph Theory 78(2015), 195--206), whose definition does not require the empty intersection condition. In this paper we discuss the relationship of this invariant to the well-known conjectures of Fulkerson (1971) and Fan and Raspaud (1994) and prove that colouring defect and regular colouring defect can be arbitrarily far apart.</description>

Abstract: A $\lambda$-quiddity of size $n$ is an $n$-tuple of elements from a fixed set, which is a solution to a matrix equation that arises in the study of Coxeter's friezes. The study of these solutions involves in particular the use of a notion of irreducibility. The main objective of this text is to demonstrate that there is a finite number of irreducible $\lambda$-quiddities over a finite unitary commutative ring and to obtain in this case an upper bound for their maximal size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in algebraic properties of empty lattice simplices $\Delta$, that is, $d$-dimensional lattice polytopes containing exactly $d+1$ points of the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The cyclicity rank of $\Delta$ is the minimal number of cyclic subgroups that the quotient group of $\Delta$ splits into. It is known that up to dimension $d \leq 4$, every empty lattice $d$-simplex is cyclic, meaning that its cyclicity rank is at most $1$. We determine the maximal possible cyclicity rank of an empty lattice $d$-simplex for dimensions $d \leq 8$, and determine the asymptotics of this number up to a logarithmic term.</description>

This resolves a question of Liu, Norin and Wood [arXiv:2410.20333]. We also show this result is best possible: for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a planar graph $G$ such that for any tree $T$ and graph $H$ with $\text{tw}(H) \leq 2$, $G$ is not contained in $H \boxtimes T \boxtimes K_c$.</description>

      <title>Uniform set systems with small VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the longstanding problem of determining the maximum size of a $(d+1)$-uniform set system with VC-dimension at most $d$. Since the seminal 1984 work of Frankl and Pach, which established the elegant upper bound $\binom{n}{d}$, this question has resisted significant progress. The best-known lower bound is $\binom{n-1}{d} + \binom{n-4}{d-2}$, obtained by Ahlswede and Khachatrian, leaving a substantial gap of $\binom{n-1}{d-1}-\binom{n-4}{d-2}$. Despite decades of effort, improvements to the Frankl--Pach bound have been incremental at best: Mubayi and Zhao introduced an $\Omega_d(\log{n})$ improvement for prime powers $d$, while Ge, Xu, Yip, Zhang, and Zhao achieved a gain of 1 for general $d$.
  In this work, we provide a purely combinatorial approach that significantly sharpens the Frankl--Pach upper bound. Specifically, for large $n$, we demonstrate that the Frankl--Pach bound can be improved to $\binom{n}{d} - \binom{n-1}{d-1} + O_d(n^{d-1 - \frac{1}{4d-2}})=\binom{n-1}{d}+O_d(n^{d-1 - \frac{1}{4d-2}})$. This result completely removes the main term $\binom{n-1}{d-1}$ from the previous gap between the known lower and upper bounds. It also offers fresh insights into the combinatorial structure of uniform set systems with small VC-dimension. In addition, the original Erd\H{o}s--Frankl--Pach conjecture, which sought to generalize the EKR theorem in the 1980s, has been disproven. We propose a new refined conjecture that might establish a sturdier bridge between VC-dimension and the EKR theorem, and we verify several specific cases of this conjecture, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of $n$ real analytic functions with linearly independent derivatives restricted to a compact interval $I$. We show that for any finite set $A \subset I$, there is a function $f \in \mathcal{F}$ that satisfies
  $$|2^{n-1}f(A)-(2^{n-1}-1)f(A)|\gg_{\mathcal{F},I} |A|^{\phi(n)},$$ where $\phi:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies the recursive formula
  $$\phi(1)=1, \quad \phi(n)=1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{\phi(n-1)}} \quad \text{for } n\geq 2.$$ The above result allows us to prove the bound
  $$|2^nf(A-A)-(2^n-1)f(A-A)| \gg_{f,n,I} |A|^{1+\phi(n)}$$ where $f$ is an analytic function for which any $n$ distinct non-trivial discrete derivatives of $f'$ are linearly independent. This condition is satisfied, for instance, by any polynomial function of degree $m \geq n+1$. We also check this condition for the function $\arctan(e^x)$ with $n=3$, allowing us to improve upon a recent bound on the additive growth of the set of angles in a Cartesian product due to Roche-Newton.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotic separation index is a parameter that measures how easily a Borel graph can be approximated by its subgraphs with finite components. In contrast to the more classical notion of hyperfiniteness, asymptotic separation index is well-suited for combinatorial applications in the Borel setting. The main result of this paper is a Borel version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma -- a powerful general-purpose tool in probabilistic combinatorics -- under a finite asymptotic separation index assumption. As a consequence, we show that locally checkable labeling problems that are solvable by efficient randomized distributed algorithms admit Borel solutions on bounded degree Borel graphs with finite asymptotic separation index. From this we derive a number of corollaries, for example a Borel version of Brooks's theorem for graphs with finite asymptotic separation index.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of $\tau$-tilting modules over path algebras and preprojective algebras of Dynkin type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new generating function called $d$-polynomial for the dimensions of $\tau$-tilting modules over a given finite dimensional algebra. Firstly, we study basic properties of $d$-polynomials and show that it can be realized as a certain sum of the $f$-polynomials of the simplicial complexes arising from $\tau$-rigid pairs. Secondly, we give explicit formulas of $d$-polynomials for preprojective algebras and path algebras of Dynkin quivers by using a close relation with $W$-Eulerian polynomials and $W$-Narayana polynomials. Thirdly, we consider the ordinary and exponential generating functions defined from $d$-polynomials and give closed-form expressions in the case of preprojective algebras and path algebras of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$.</description>

      <title>Categorification of Rainbow Paths on Odd Reflection Graphs through Homomorphisms between Verma Supermodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the interplay between different highest weight structures in the BGG category O of basic Lie superalgebras arising from distinct choices of Borel subalgebras-an aspect that has no analogous theory in the classical Lie algebra setting.
  We describe the compositions of homomorphisms between Verma supermodules arising from different highest weight structure but sharing the same character. This requires us to define a class of edge-colored graphs, defined purely graph theoretically, by extracting the exchange property of odd reflections. As an application of these homomorphisms, we generalize results of Coulembier-Serganova and Chen-Mazorchuk concerning the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma supermodules.</description>

Abstract: Convex solutions $A,B,I,J$ of four Abel equations are numerically studied. We do not know exact formulas for any of these functions, but conjecture that $A,B$ and $I,J$ are closely related. [Corrigendum at end.]</description>
