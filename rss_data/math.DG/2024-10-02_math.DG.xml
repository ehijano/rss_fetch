      <title>Geometry on curves passing through Whitney umbrella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study geometry on curves passing through a Whitney umbrella by using a Darboux frame along it. We define three invariants by using Frenet-Serre type formula relating to the geodesic curvature, the normal curvature, and the geodesic torsion. We investigate the degrees of divergence and the top-terms of these invariants and their geometric meanings. We also consider a developable surface along the curve.</description>

      <title>The Brylinski beta function of a coaxial layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Pooja Rani and M. K. Vemuri, The Brylinski beta function of a double layer, Differential Geom. Appl. \textbf{92}(2024)], an analogue of Brylinski's knot beta function was defined for a compactly supported (Schwartz) distribution $T$ on Euclidean space. Here we consider the Brylinski beta function of the distribution defined by a coaxial layer on a submanifold of Euclidean space. We prove that it has an analytic continuation to the whole complex plane as a meromorphic function with only simple poles, and in the case of a coaxial layer on a space curves, we compute some of the residues in terms of the curvature and torsion.</description>

      <title>A potential theory for the Wess--Zumino--Witten equation in the space of K\"ahler potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a potential theory for the Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) equation in the space of K\"ahler potentials which is parallel to the potential theory for the Hermitian--Yang--Mills equation. A concept called $\omega$-harmonicity on graphs is introduced which characterizes the WZW equation. We also show that, with respect to a Banach--Mazur type distance function, the distance between two solutions of the WZW equation is subharmonic.
  The harmonic map into the space of K\"ahler potentials, as a special case of the WZW equation, is also investigated. In particular, we show the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the harmonic map, and the approximation/quantization by its finite dimensional counterparts.</description>

      <title>On the existence and prolongation of infinitesimal isometries on special sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we deal with (local) infinitesimal isometries of special sub-Riemannian manifolds (a contact and oriented sub-Riemannian manifold is called special if the Reeb vector field is an isometry). The objective of the paper is to find some conditions on such manifolds which allow one to construct, locally around a given point, infinitesimal isometries and then, possibly, to prolong them onto bigger domains. The mentioned conditions are related to the so-called $\is^*$-regular and $\is$-regular points, the notions introduced by Nomizu in [22] in the Riemannian setting and slightly modified by the author.</description>

      <title>Kervaire semi-characteristics in KK-theory and an Atiyah type vanishing theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On (4n + 1)-dimensional (noncompact) manifolds admitting proper cocompact Lie group actions, we explore the analytic and topological sides of Kervaire semi-characteristics. The analytic side puts together two interpretations, one via assembly maps, and the other via dimensions of kernels. The topological side is ensured by the proper cocompact version of the Hodge theorem. The two sides coincide and admit an Atiyah type vanishing theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a temporal compact globally hyperbolic manifold with Cauchy hypersurface $\Sigma$ which is a Galois covering with respect to a discrete group $\Gamma$ of automorphisms such that the quotient $\Sigma/\Gamma$ is compact without boundary. We will show Fredholmness of a (spatial) $\Gamma$-invariant Lorentzian Dirac operator under (anti) Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions in the von Neumann sense, known as ($L^2$-)$\Gamma$-Fredholmness. The results already have been published for a simpler setting in arXiv:2107.08532. This version is only focused on the Fredholmness part, based on previous results from arXiv:2409.17344, and also generalised (anti) Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions are going to be considered as well.</description>

      <title>Warped geometries of Segre-Veronese manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segre-Veronese manifolds are smooth manifolds consisting of partially symmetric rank-$1$ tensors. They are naturally viewed as submanifolds of a Euclidean space of tensors. However, they can also be equipped with other metrics than their induced metrics, such as warped product metrics. We investigate a one-parameter family of warped geometries, which includes the standard Euclidean geometry, and whose parameter controls by how much spherical tangent directions are weighted relative to radial tangent directions. We compute the exponential and logarithmic maps of these warped Segre-Veronese manifolds, including the corresponding starting and connecting geodesics. A closed formula for the intrinsic distance between points on the warped Segre-Veronese manifold is presented. We determine for which warping parameters Segre-Veronese manifolds are geodesically connected and show that they are not geodesically connected in the standard Euclidean geometry. The benefits of connecting geodesics may outweigh using the Euclidean geometry in certain applications. One such application is presented: numerically computing the Riemannian center of mass for averaging rank-$1$ tensors.</description>

      <title>Geometric shape matching for recovering protein conformations from single-particle Cryo-EM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address recovery of the three-dimensional backbone structure of single polypeptide proteins from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-SPA) data. Cryo-SPA produces noisy tomographic projections of electrostatic potentials of macromolecules. From these projections, we use methods from shape analysis to recover the three-dimensional backbone structure. Thus, we view the reconstruction problem as an indirect matching problem, where a point cloud representation of the protein backbone is deformed to match 2D tomography data. The deformations are obtained via the action of a matrix Lie group. By selecting a deformation energy, the optimality conditions are obtained, which lead to computational algorithms for optimal deformations. We showcase our approach on synthetic data, for which we recover the three-dimensional structure of the backbone.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional reductions and finite-gap type solutions of multicomponent integrable PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main object of the paper is a recently discovered family of multicomponent integrable systems of partial differential equations, whose particular cases include many well-known equations such as the Korteweg--de Vries, coupled KdV, Harry Dym, coupled Harry Dym, Camassa--Holm, multicomponent Camassa--Holm, Dullin--Gottwald--Holm, and Kaup--Boussinesq equations.
  We suggest a methodology for constructing a series of solutions for all systems in the family. The crux of the approach lies in reducing this system to a dispersionless integrable system which is a special case of linearly degenerate quasilinear systems actively explored since the 1990s and recently studied in the framework of Nijenhuis geometry. These infinite-dimensional integrable systems are closely connected to certain explicit finite-dimensional integrable systems. We provide a link between solutions of our multicomponent PDE systems and solutions of this finite-dimensional system, and use it to construct animations of multi-component analogous of soliton and cnoidal solutions.</description>

Abstract: We present an introduction to boundary value problems for Dirac-type operators on complete Riemannian manifolds with compact boundary. We introduce a very general class of boundary conditions which contains local elliptic boundary conditions in the sense of Lopatinskij and Shapiro as well as the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions. We discuss boundary regularity of solutions and also spectral and index theory. The emphasis is on providing the reader with a working knowledge.</description>

      <title>Mass Inequality and Stability of the Positive Mass Theorem For K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an integral inequality and two stability results for the ADM mass on AE K\"ahler manifolds of all complex dimensions. The inequality bounds the ADM mass from below by an integral of the scalar curvature and the Hessian of certain holomorphic coordinate functions arising from the complex coordinates at infinity. Using this, we first prove a stability result for any sequence of AE K\"ahler manifolds with ADM mass converging to zero. We conclude that, for any such sequence, there exist subsets of each with vanishing boundaries in the limit such that the complements converge to Euclidean space in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This gives the first stability result of the Positive Mass Theorem for K\"ahler manifolds, or more generally, of manifolds without strong curvature or volume conditions or for a very explicit family of metrics in real dimensions greater than three. If we furthermore impose a uniform lower bound on the Ricci curvature, the second stability theorem shows the same result without taking the complement of a sequence of vanishing sets. Finally, we find three new families of AE K\"ahler manifolds with vanishing mass in the limit for which the stability results apply.</description>

      <title>Parallel spinors for $\mathrm{G}_2^*$ and isotropic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a correspondence between irreducible real parallel spinors on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ of signature $(4,3)$ and solutions of an associated differential system for three-forms that satisfy a homogeneous algebraic equation of order two in the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle of $(M,g)$. Applying this general framework, we obtain an intrinsic algebraic characterization of $\mathrm{G}_2^*$-structures as well as the first explicit description of isotropic irreducible spinors in signature $(4,3)$ that are parallel under a general connection on the spinor bundle. This description is given in terms of a coherent system of mutually orthogonal and isotropic one forms and follows from the characterization of the stabilizer of an isotropic spinor as the stabilizer of a highly degenerate three-form that we construct explicitly. Using this result, we show that isotropic spinors parallel under a metric connection with torsion exist when the connection preserves the aforementioned coherent system. This allows us to construct a natural class of metrics of signature $(4,3)$ on $\mathbb{R}^7$ that admit spinors parallel under a metric connection with torsion.</description>

      <title>A lower semicontinuous time separation function for $C^0$ spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time separation function (or Lorentzian distance function) is a fundamental object used in Lorentzian geometry. For smooth spacetimes it is known to be lower semicontinuous, and in fact, continuous for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Moreover, an axiom for Lorentzian length spaces - a synthetic approach to Lorentzian geometry - is the existence of a lower semicontinuous time separation function. Nevertheless, the usual time separation function is $\textit{not}$ necessarily lower semicontinuous for $C^0$ spacetimes due to bubbling phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a class of curves called "nearly timelike" and show that the time separation function for $C^0$ spacetimes is lower semicontinuous when defined with respect to nearly timelike curves. Moreover, this time separation function agrees with the usual one when the metric is smooth. Lastly, sufficient conditions are found guaranteeing the existence of a nearly timelike maximizer between two points in a $C^0$ spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $d \geq 4$, we construct a $d$-dimensional, log canonical, $K$-trivial variety with the property that two general fibers of its Albanese morphism are not birational. This provides a strong counterexample to the Beauville--Bogomolov decomposition in the log canonical setting. This construction can also be adapted to construct a smooth quasi-projective variety of logarithmic Kodaira dimension 0 whose quasi-Albanese morphism has maximal variation. On the positive side, we show that the Albanese morphism for log canonical pairs with nef anti-canonical class is a locally stable family of pairs.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic momentum map reduction and a Chaplygin-type foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a set-up for momentum map reduction of nonholonomic systems with symmetries, extending previous constructions in [3,25], based on the existence of certain conserved quantities and making essential use of the nonholonomic momentum bundle map of [10]. We show that the reductions of the momentum level sets carry an almost symplectic form codifying the reduced dynamics. These reduced manifolds are the leaves of the foliation associated with an almost Poisson bracket obtained by a (dynamically compatible) gauge transformation of the nonholonomic bracket. We show that each leaf is a "Chaplygin-type leaf", in the sense that it is isomorphic to a cotangent bundle with the canonical symplectic form plus a "magnetic term".</description>
