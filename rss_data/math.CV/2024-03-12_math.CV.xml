      <title>Analyticity, superoscillations and supershifts in several variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superoscillations have roots in various scientific disciplines, including optics, signal processing, radar theory, and quantum mechanics. This intriguing mathematical phenomenon permits specific functions to oscillate at a rate surpassing their highest Fourier component. A more encompassing concept, supershifts, extends the idea of superoscillations to functions that are not sum of exponential functions. This broader notion is linked to Bernstein and Lagrange approximation of analytic functions in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Recent advancements in the theory of superoscillations and supershifts in one variable have focused on their time evolution. This paper takes a step further by expanding the notion of supershifts to include the case of several variables. We provide specific examples related to harmonic analysis where the variables vary in multi-dimensional frequency (space, or scale) domains.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence for holomorphic semigroups of finite shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parabolic semigroups of finite shift in the unit disk with regard to the rate of convergence of their orbits to the Denjoy--Wolff point. We examine this rate in terms of Euclidean distance, hyperbolic distance and harmonic measure. In each case, we provide explicit examples to display the sharpness of the results. We further discuss the corresponding rates of convergence for parabolic semigroups of positive hyperbolic step and infinite shift.</description>

      <title>Extending the Meijer $G$-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By replacing the Euler gamma function by the Barnes double gamma function in the definition of the Meijer $G$-function, we introduce a new family of special functions, which we call $K$-functions. This is a very general class of functions, which includes as special cases Meijer $G$-functions (thus also all hypergeometric functions ${}_p F_q$) as well as several new functions that appeared recently in the literature. Our goal is to define the $K$-function, study its analytic and transformation properties and relate it to several functions that appeared recently in the study of random processes and the fractional Laplacian. We further introduce a generalization of the Kilbas-Saigo function and show that it is a special case of $K$-function.</description>

      <title>Local and global blow-downs of transport twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport twistor spaces are degenerate complex $2$-dimensional manifolds $Z$ that complexify transport problems on Riemannian surfaces, appearing e.g.~in geometric inverse problems. This article considers maps $\beta\colon Z\to \mathbb{C}^2$ with a holomorphic blow-down structure that resolve the degeneracy of the complex structure and allow to gain insight into the complex geometry of $Z$. The main theorems provide global $\beta$-maps for constant curvature metrics and their perturbations and local $\beta$-maps for arbitrary metrics, thereby proving a version of the classical Newlander--Nirenberg theorem for degenerate complex structures.</description>

Abstract: We completely characterize $L^p-L^q$ boundedness of two classes of Forelli-Rudin type operators on the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^n$ for all $(p, q)\in [1, \infty]\times [1, \infty]$. The results are not only a complement to some previous results on Forelli-Rudin type operators by Kures and Zhu in 2006 and the first author in 2015, but also a high dimension extension of some results by Cheng, Fang, Wang and Yu in 2017.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Bergman metric of the ball quotients $\mathbb{B}^2/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite and fixed point free group, is K\"ahler-Einstein if and only if $\Gamma$ is trivial. As a consequence, we characterize the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^2$, among 2 dimensional Stein spaces with isolated normal singularities, proving an algebraic version of Cheng's conjecture for 2 dimensional Stein spaces.</description>

      <title>Baum-Bott residue currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation of rank $\kappa$ on a complex manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, let $Z$ be a compact connected component of the singular set of $\mathscr{F}$, and let $\Phi \in \mathbb C[z_1,\ldots,z_n]$ be a homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree $\ell$ with $n-\kappa &lt; \ell \leq n$. Given a locally free resolution of the normal sheaf of $\mathscr{F}$, equipped with Hermitian metrics and certain smooth connections, we construct an explicit current $R^\Phi_Z$ with support on $Z$ that represents the Baum-Bott residue $\text{res}^\Phi(\mathscr{F}; Z)\in H_{2n-2\ell}(Z, \mathbb C)$ and is obtained as the limit of certain smooth representatives of $\text{res}^\Phi(\mathscr{F}; Z)$. If the connections are $(1,0)$-connections and $\text{codim} Z\geq \ell$, then $R^\Phi_Z$ is independent of the choice of metrics and connections. When $\mathscr{F}$ has rank one we give a more precise description of $R^\Phi_Z$ in terms of so-called residue currents of Bochner-Martinelli type. In particular, when the singularities are isolated, we recover the classical expression of Baum-Bott residues in terms of Grothendieck residues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Banach spaces of Dirichlet series has drawn an increasing attention in the recent 25 years. One of the main interest of this new theory is that of defining analogues of the classical spaces of analytic functions on the unit disc. In this sense, Bergman spaces were introduced several years ago contributing to broaden the picture of this theory. In the paper presenting these new family of spaces, some of its most essential questions were considered. Among them, some partial estimates of the norm of the pointwise evaluation functional were given. In this work, we introduce a version of the Riemann-Liouville semigroup acting on these spaces, and, with this new tool, we are able to estimate the norm of this functional.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and prove an equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$. In both settings using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik plays an important role.</description>

      <title>The infinitesimal behavior of the sum of Cauchy kernels and its derivative at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In analysis, it's often useful to know the value of a function at infinity, this operation possesses pleasant properties. However, even when the limit does not exist, some intuitive considerations may suggest that the function still assumes a specific value at infinity in a certain sense. In Nevanlinna theory, all objects are studied on average, i.e., their integrals, hence the integral interpretation of the concept of convergence to a limit is beneficial for the theory of meromorphic functions. This is precisely the focus of this work, applied to sums of Cauchy kernels and their derivatives.</description>

Abstract: Given a symmetric Siegel domain $\mathscr D$ and a positive plurihamonic function $f$ on $\mathscr D$, we study the largest positive Radon measure $\mu$ on the Silov boundary $\mathrm b \mathscr D$ of $\mathscr D$ whose Poisson integral $\mathscr P \mu$ is $\leq f$. If $\mathscr D$ has no tubular irreducible factors of rank $\geq 2$, we show that $\mathscr P \mu$ is plurihamonic, and that $f-\mathscr P \mu$ is linear. As an application, we describe a possible analogue of the family of Clark measures associated with a holomorphic function from $\mathscr D$ into the unit disc in $\mathbb C$.</description>

      <title>The toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider distinguished varieties in the bidisc $\mathbb D^2$ and the symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb{G}_2$. A commuting pair of Hilbert space operators $(S,P)$ for which $\Gamma=\overline{\mathbb{G}}_2$ is a spectral set is called a \textit{$\Gamma$-contraction}. A commuting pair of contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ is said to be \textit{toral} if there is a toral polynomial $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $p(T_1,T_2)=0$. Similarly, a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ is called $\Gamma$-\textit{distinguished} if $(S,P)$ is annihilated by a $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial in $\mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$. The main results af this article are the following: we find a necessary and sufficient condition such that a toral pair of contractions dilates to a toral pair of isometries. Also, we characterize all $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions that admit $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometric dilations. We determine the distinguished boundary of a distinguished variety in $\mathbb D^2$ and $\mathbb G_2$. Then we prove that a pair of commuting contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ (or a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$) dilates to a toral pair of isometries (or a $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometry) if and only if there is a toral polynomial (or $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial) $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb D}^2$ (or $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb G}_2$) is a complete spectral set for $(T_1,T_2)$ (or $(S,P)$). We provide several examples at places to show the contrasts between the theory of toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions.</description>

Abstract: We treat generalizations of Koll\'ar's torsion-freeness, vanishing theorem, and so on, for projective morphisms between complex analytic spaces as an application of the theory of variations of mixed Hodge structure. The results will play a crucial role in the theory of minimal models for projective morphisms of complex analytic spaces. In this paper, we do not use Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e-III Monodromy Maps Under the $D_6\to D_8$ Confluence and Applications to the Large-Parameter Asymptotics of Rational Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third Painlev\'e equation in its generic form, often referred to as Painlev\'e-III($D_6$), is given by $$ \frac{{\rm d}^2u}{{\rm d}x^2} =\frac{1}{u}\left(\frac{{\rm d}u}{{\rm d}x}\right)^2-\frac{1}{x}\frac{{\rm d}u}{{\rm d}x}+\frac{\alpha u^2+\beta}{x}+4u^3-\frac{4}{u}, \qquad \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb C.$$ Starting from a generic initial solution $u_0(x)$ corresponding to parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, denoted as the triple $(u_0(x),\alpha,\beta)$, we apply an explicit B\"acklund transformation to generate a family of solutions $(u_n(x),\alpha+4n,\beta+4n)$ indexed by $n \in \mathbb N$. We study the large $n$ behavior of the solutions $(u_n(x),\alpha+4n,\beta+4n)$ under the scaling $x=z/n$ in two different ways: (a) analyzing the convergence properties of series solutions to the equation, and (b) using a Riemann-Hilbert representation of the solution $u_n(z/n)$. Our main result is a proof that the limit of solutions $u_n(z/n)$ exists and is given by a solution of the degenerate Painlev\'e-III equation, known as Painlev\'e-III($D_8$), $$ \frac{{\rm d}^2U}{{\rm d}z^2} =\frac{1}{U}\left(\frac{{\rm d}U}{{\rm d}z}\right)^2-\frac{1}{z}\frac{{\rm d}U}{{\rm d}z}+\frac{4U^2+4}{z}.$$ A notable application of our result is to rational solutions of Painlev\'e-III($D_6$), which are constructed using the seed solution $(1,4m,-4m)$ where $m \in \mathbb C \setminus \big(\mathbb Z +\frac{1}{2}\big)$ and can be written as a particular ratio of Umemura polynomials. We identify the limiting solution in terms of both its initial condition at $z=0$ when it is well defined, and by its monodromy data in the general case. Furthermore, as a consequence of our analysis, we deduce the asymptotic behavior of generic solutions of Painlev\'e-III, both $D_6$ and $D_8$ at $z=0$. We also deduce the large $n$ behavior of the Umemura polynomials in a neighborhood of $z=0$.</description>

      <title>Representations of braid groups via cyclic covers of the sphere: Zariski closure and arithmeticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 2$ and $n\geq 3$ be two natural numbers. Given any sequence $\kappa=(k_1,\dots,k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\gcd(k_1,\dots,k_n,d)=1$, we consider the family of Riemann surfaces obtained from the plane curves defined by $y^d=\prod_{i=1}^n(x-b_i)^{k_i}$, where $\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}$ are $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{C}$. The monodromy of the cohomology of the fibers of this family provides us with a representation of the pure braid group $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into some symplectic group. By restricting to a specific subspace in the cohomology of the fibers, we obtain a representation $\rho_d$ of $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into a linear algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In a sense, $\rho_d$ is primitive with respect to the parameters $d$ and $\kappa$. The first main result of this paper is a criterion for the Zariski closure of the image of $\rho_d$ to be maximal, and the second main result is a criterion for the image to be an arithmetic lattice in the target group. The latter generalizes previous results of Venkataramana and gives an answer to a question by McMullen.</description>
