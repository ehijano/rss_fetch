      <title>A Comprehensive multi-species comparison of rotational temperature probes in a DC Ar/N$_2$ micro-hollow cathode discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04967</link>

Abstract: Accurate gas temperature ($T_{\rm Gas}$) determination in microplasmas is critical for optimizing their applications, yet isolated diagnostic approaches may yield misleading results, especially under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Here, high resolution rotational spectra of N$_2$(C), OH(A), NH(A) and NO(A), generated in the plasma jet of a DC Ar/N$_2$ microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD), are recorded and their associated rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) are cross compared. A detailed experimental analysis and robust fitting of the rotational spectra are performed, achieving a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm Gas}$. The dominant formation mechanisms of these species and their corresponding impact on rotational population distributions are also interrogated. Particularly, our findings indicate that the $T_{\rm rot}$of N$_2$(C) is significantly influenced by energy transfers from argon metastables (Ar$^m$) and spectral interference from NH(A). This makes it unreliable as a thermometric probe in Ar-rich MHCD, unless complex analyses are employed. In contrast, OH(A) rotational population distribution appears to be less sensitive to Ar-induced perturbations across various discharge currents and pressures, providing more straightforward results. For all molecules considered, this study reveals the conditions under which all the measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be reliably considered to be in equilibrium with $T_{\rm Gas}$. This highlights the importance of crossvalidating multiple thermometric probes and investigating relevant excitation kinetics when measuring $T_{\rm rot}$ in reactive microplasmas.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for radiative hydrodynamics in astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.
  Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.
  The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.
  The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Optimization of laser-driven proton acceleration in a near-critical-density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19341</link>

Abstract: Optimizing laser and plasma parameters is crucial for enhancing accelerated proton energy in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. Tight focusing plays a significant role in improving laser-driven proton acceleration, which is generally believed as a result of the enhancement of laser intensity. However, we find that even at a fixed laser intensity, reducing the focal spot size still enhances the proton energy. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at a small spot size (0.8 {\mu}m), the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 56.3% compared to that obtained at a conventional spot size (3 {\mu}m). This improvement is attributed to the dominance of ponderomotive-force-driven electrons at reduced spot sizes, which generate stronger charge-separation fields that propagate at higher velocities. Furthermore, to optimize proton acceleration, we analytically derive an ideal plasma density profile that promotes phase-stable proton acceleration, yielding an additional energy increase of 61.3% over the case of a tightly focused laser interacting with a planar target of uniform density. These findings remain robust under parameter variations, indicating that advanced focusing techniques combined with optimized plasma profiles could relax the demand for high laser energies, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale laser facilities in medical and scientific applications.</description>
