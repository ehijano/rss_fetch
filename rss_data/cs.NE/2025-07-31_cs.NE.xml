      <title>Pendulum Model of Spiking Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a biologically inspired model of spiking neurons based on the dynamics of a damped, driven pendulum. Unlike traditional models such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, the pendulum neuron incorporates second-order, nonlinear dynamics that naturally give rise to oscillatory behavior and phase-based spike encoding. This model captures richer temporal features and supports timing-sensitive computations critical for sequence processing and symbolic learning. We present an analysis of single-neuron dynamics and extend the model to multi-neuron layers governed by Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rules. We demonstrate practical implementation with python code and with the Brian2 spiking neural simulator, and outline a methodology for deploying the model on neuromorphic hardware platforms, using an approximation of the second-order equations. This framework offers a foundation for developing energy-efficient neural systems for neuromorphic computing and sequential cognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid activation functions for deep neural networks: S3 and S4 -- a novel approach to gradient flow optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks, directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance. Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4 (smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression. The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths, making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for improving neural network training dynamics.</description>

      <title>OpenRASE: Service Function Chain Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) are one of the key enablers in providing programmable computer networks, paving the way for network autonomy. However, this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity, unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE. The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and practicality for dynamic network conditions.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Better Network for Visualizing and Analyzing Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Unified Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness, and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness, modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to algorithm's stagnation.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$. The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials: energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N \cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$) and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim (Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D central-force spring networks.</description>

      <title>Tapping into the Black Box: Uncovering Aligned Representations in Pretrained Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients (called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.</description>

      <title>($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l, \boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-Parametric Multi-Task Optimization: Joint Search in Solution and Infinite Task Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to operate in two complementary modes. In an offline optimization mode, a joint search over solution and task spaces is carried out with the creation of two approximation models: (1) for mapping points in a unified solution space to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to their corresponding solutions, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. In the online mode, the derived models enable direct optimization of any task within the bounds without the need to search from scratch. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.</description>

      <title>The Cooperative Network Architecture: Learning Structured Networks as Representation of Sensory Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.</description>

      <title>Automated Prompt Engineering for Cost-Effective Code Generation Using Evolutionary Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have seen increasing use in various software development tasks, especially in code generation. The most advanced recent methods attempt to incorporate feedback from code execution into prompts to help guide LLMs in generating correct code in an iterative process. While effective, these methods could be costly due to numerous interactions with the LLM and extensive token usage. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach named Evolutionary Prompt Engineering for Code (EPiC), which leverages a lightweight evolutionary algorithm to refine the original prompts into improved versions that generate high quality code, with minimal interactions with the LLM. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM based code generation agents shows that EPiC not only achieves up to 6% improvement in pass@k but is also 2-10 times more cost-effective than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Evolution Strategies to Train Transformers in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the capability of evolution strategies to train an agent with a policy based on a transformer architecture in a reinforcement learning setting. We performed experiments using OpenAI's highly parallelizable evolution strategy to train Decision Transformer in the MuJoCo Humanoid locomotion environment and in the environment of Atari games, testing the ability of this black-box optimization technique to train even such relatively large and complicated models (compared to those previously tested in the literature). The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to produce high-performing agents, showcasing evolution's ability to tackle the training of even such complex models.</description>
