      <title>Study of the interaction between $\Xi$ baryons and light mesons via femtoscopy at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meson-baryon systems with strangeness content provide a unique laboratory for investigating the strong interaction and testing theoretical models of hadron structure and dynamics. In this work, the measured correlation functions for oppositely charged $\Xi-{\rm K}$ and $\Xi-\pi$ pairs obtained in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV at the LHC are presented. For the first time, high-precision data on the $\Xi-{\rm K}$ interaction are delivered at small relative momenta. The scattering lengths, extracted via the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits expression of the pair wavefunction, indicate a repulsive and a shallow attractive strong interaction for the $\Xi-{\rm K}$ and $\Xi-\pi$ systems, respectively. The $\Xi(1620)$ and $\Xi(1690)$ states are observed in the $\Xi-\pi$ correlation function and their properties, mass and width, are determined. These measurements are in agreement with other available results. Such high-precision data can help refine the understanding of these resonant states, provide stronger constraints for chirally motivated potentials, and address the key challenge of describing the coupled-channel dynamics that may give rise to molecular configurations.</description>

      <title>Overview on Efforts for a Second Detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will provide a unique experimental platform to explore the properties of gluons in nucleons and nuclei, offering new insights into their structure and dynamics. The EIC community has outlined a detailed physics program and the demanding detector requirements in a comprehensive detailed document. The primary general-purpose detector, ePIC, is designed to support a broad range of physics studies. However, there is strong community support for a second detector at the EIC to further enhance the scientific capabilities of the facility. A second detector would provide cross-checks and systematic controls for potential discoveries, while incorporating complementary technologies to address physics measurements that may be underrepresented by ePIC. In particular, it would improve forward detector acceptance at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and enable more precise measurements in exclusive, diffractive, and tagging physics. This talk will provide a general overview of the second detector and outline its potential capabilities, highlighting key areas of the physics program it could enhance.</description>

      <title>Decay study of the most neutron-deficient Zn isotopes with the Warsaw Optical TPC detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of decay studies of nuclei in the vicinity of 54Zn, which is the most neutron-deficient isotope of zinc and undergoes ground-state two-proton radioactivity (2p), are presented. The measurements were performed with a gaseous time projection chamber with optical readout which allowed us to record tracks of protons emitted in the decays. A new method of data analysis was used to reconstruct energies and emission angles of low-energy protons that were stopped within the active volume of the chamber. Half-lives and branching ratios for \b{eta}-delayed proton emission channels were determined for 56Zn, 55Zn, and 55Cu. The \b{eta}-delayed emission of two protons for 55Zn was observed for the first time. Five events of 2p radioactivity of 54Zn were detected and reconstructed. The distribution of the opening angle between momenta of the two protons is consistent with the findings published in [Ascher et al. PRL 107, 102502 (2011)]. The combination of all results suggests a flat angular distribution, in contrast to the one measured for 45Fe.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of island of inversion in odd-$A$ nuclei: Structure of $^{31,33}$Mg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $N=20$ island of inversion region in the odd-$A$ Ne and Mg isotopes from the fundamental nuclear forces based on chiral two- and three-nucleon potentials. The state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} valence space in medium similarity renormalization method was used for this purpose. Our study focuses on the evolution of single-particle states and discusses their transition into the island of inversion through particle-hole excitations across the $N=20$ shell gap. The computed low-lying states and magnetic moments are in good agreement with the experimental data. We presented the rotational band structures, established via $E2$ transitions, in $^{31}$Mg and $^{33}$Mg, which emerge from both normal and intruder configurations at low excitation energies. Our results suggest the presence of weak, moderate, and strongly prolate-deformed configurations at low energy in both isotopes. The present work offers valuable insights into the configurations and shapes of low-lying states in nuclei within the island of inversion, enhancing our understanding of the structures of exotic nuclei from first principles.</description>

      <title>Resonance Contributions to Charged-Current (Anti)Neutrino-Nucleon Elastic Scattering at GeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties with low-resolution nuclear forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-resolution nuclear Hamiltonians, obtained from chiral effective field theory (EFT) and softened using renormalization group techniques, have been very successful in nuclear structure theory. The associated EFT truncation uncertainty for these potentials is difficult to quantify. We use singular values decompositions of low-resolution nuclear forces to obtain an operator basis to study Hamiltonian uncertainties for these potentials. We perform Bayesian inference for the singular values and three-body low-energy constants, the free parameters of nuclear Hamiltonians in our framework, using likelihoods based on nucleon-nucleon phase shifts and triton observables to account for the EFT truncation uncertainties in these quantities. We propagate the resulting distribution of Hamiltonians forward to predictions for ground-state properties of $^{24,28}$O and $^{48}$Ca, comparing against other state-of-the-art nuclear structure predictions. Our approach makes it possible to account for EFT uncertainties when using low-resolution potentials, which is important for many ongoing studies in exotic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Precision calculation of $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be for solar physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the cross section for radiative capture $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). At this order of perturbation, momentum dependent two-body currents make their first appearance. We provide a model-independent construction of these currents from gauge and Galilean invariance, where the general framework for constructing higher-order two-body currents in low-energy effective field theories becomes evident. The $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be astrophysical S-factor $S_{34}(0)= 0.564^{+0.17}_{-0.015}$ keV b is obtained from a Bayesian analysis at NNLO, with an additional nominal theoretical uncertainty $\pm0.017$ keV b of 3%.</description>

      <title>New insights from the flavor dependence of quark transverse momentum distributions in the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We update our previous extraction of transverse momentum distributions of unpolarized quarks in the pion by implementing a more comprehensive description of theoretical uncertainties and, for the first time, by exploring possible differences among quark flavors. We extract such distributions from all available data for unpolarized pion-nucleus Drell-Yan processes, where the cross section is differential in the transverse momentum of the final lepton pair. The cross section involves transverse momentum distributions in the nucleon, that we consistently take from our previous studies.</description>

      <title>Calculation and comparison of sensitivities in $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments based on key parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Worldwide efforts are underway to detect neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay using experiments based on various technologies and target isotopes. Future experiments in this regard aim to exclude the inverted order (IO) condition or explore the normal order (NO) band. Consequently, comparing the sensitivities of proposed $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments with promising prospects is essential. The current study adopts sensitivity metrics, including exclusion and discovery sensitivities, half-life sensitivities, and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of ten typical promising experiments: LEGEND, CDEX, nEXO, XLZD, PandaX, NEXT, KamLAND-Zen, JUNO, SNO+, and CUPID, and highlight their unique features. Based on reported experimental parameters, the concept of a ``technical line'' is introduced to determine the location that each experiment may realize in the $\xi$ and $\lambda_{b}$ space, where $\xi$ represents the sensitive exposure per year, and $\lambda_{b}$ denotes the expected annual rate of background events. Half-life sensitivities for the selected experiments are calculated, some of them in multiple phases and others in conservative or aggressive condition. The results indicate that increasing the operation time is more beneficial for zero-background experiments, which also demonstrate greater competitiveness in discovery sensitivity. $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are presented as uncertainty bands arising from the nuclear matrix element uncertainties. Additionally, half-life and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are estimated under ideal conditions also in the form of uncertainty bands, where only irreducible $2\nu\beta\beta$ and solar B-8 neutrino induced background remain.</description>

      <title>Delta isobar resonance effects studied by summed isospin spin strengths and nuclear matrix elements for double and single beta decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for double and single beta decays are crucial for studying neutrino properties beyond and within the standard model. The NMEs consist mainly of the spin isospin components. The delta isobar resonance, which is strongly excited by the qualk spin isospin excitation, is shown to quench the spin isospin NMEs by a coefficient around 0.7. Impact of the delta resonance on neutrino studies in nuclei is discused.</description>

      <title>Triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum for exotic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (TRHBc) has been developed to incorporate triaxial deformation, pairing correlations, and continuum effects in a fully microscopic and self-consistent way, aiming for a reliable description of triaxial exotic nuclei with extreme neutron-to-proton ratios. The TRHBc formalism is presented in detail, and its numerical implementation is benchmarked against the results from the axially deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum and the TRHB theory in harmonic oscillator expansion. The TRHBc theory is applied to investigate the aluminum isotopes systematically, and the available data are well reproduced for the binding energies, one- and two-neutron separation energies, and charge radii. The nuclei near the one-neutron drip line, $^{40}$Al and $^{42}$Al, are found to be triaxially deformed with one-neutron separation energies below 1 MeV. Possible neutron halos in the triaxial nuclei $^{40}$Al and $^{42}$Al are explored by examining the single-particle levels around the Fermi surface, including their composition and contribution to the total neutron density. The existence of neutron halos in $^{40}$Al and $^{42}$Al is also supported by the halo scale, which is comparable to other halo nuclei well-established previously. More importantly, the mechanism for the halo formation in $^{40}$Al is revealed to be the triaxial deformation, which results in the decoupling of the halo orbitals from those of the core.</description>

      <title>Glauber quark and gluon contributions to quark energy loss at next-to-leading order and next-to-leading twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The higher-twist (HT) formalism is used at $O(\alpha^2_s)$ to compute all possible medium-induced single-scattering emission kernels for an incoming highly energetic and virtual quark traversing the nuclear environment. The effects of the heavy-quark mass scale are taken into account [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)] both in the initial state as well as in the final state, along with interactions involving both in-medium Glauber gluons and quarks [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. As this study is a continuation of our work on medium-induced photon production [Phys. Rev. C 112, 025204 (2025)], the general factorization procedure for $e$-$A$ deep-inelastic scattering is still used. An incoming quark energy loss in the nuclear medium yields four possible scattering kernels $K_i$ with the following final states: (i) $q+g$, (ii) $g+g$, (iii) $q+\bar{q}'$, where the quark $q$ may have a flavor different from the antiquark $\bar{q}'$, and (iv) $q+q'$, where, again, $q$ may have a flavor different from $q'$. The collisional kernels include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete first-order derivative in the longitudinal direction ($k^-$) as well as second-order derivative in the transverse momentum ($k_{\perp}$) gradient expansion. Furthermore, in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse-momentum dependence (of the emitted quark or gluon) present within the phase factor.</description>
