      <title>Shear and bulk viscosity for a pure glue theory using an effective matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At nonzero temperatures, the deconfining phase transition can be analyzed using an effective matrix model to characterize the change in holonomy. The model includes gluons and two-dimensional ghost fields in the adjoint representation, or ``teens''. As ghosts, the teen fields are responsible for the decrease of the pressure as $T \rightarrow T_d$, with $T_d$ the transition temperature for deconfinement. Using the solution of this matrix model for a large number of colors, the parameters of the teen fields are adjusted so that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is close to the values from the lattice. The shear, $\eta$, and bulk, $\zeta$, viscosities are computed in weak coupling but nonzero holonomy. In the pure glue theory, the value of the Polyakov loop is relatively large in the deconfined phase, $\approx 1/2$ at $T_d$. Consequently, if $s$ is the entropy density, while $\eta/s$ decreases as $T\rightarrow T_d$, it is still well above the conformal bound. In contrast, $\zeta/s$ is largest at $T_d$, comparable to $\eta/s$, then falls off rapidly with increasing temperature and is negligible by $\sim 2 T_d$.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of the Interacting Schwinger Model on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations in high-energy physics are currently emerging as an application of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we explore the multi-flavor lattice Schwinger model - a toy model inspired by quantum chromodynamics - in one spatial dimension and with nonzero chemical potential by means of variational quantum simulation on a shuttling-based trapped-ion quantum processor. This fermionic problem becomes intractable for classical numerical methods even for small system sizes due to the notorious sign problem. We employ a parametric quantum circuit executed on our quantum processor to identify ground states in different parameter regimes of the model, mapping out a quantum phase transition which is the hallmark feature of the model. The resulting states are analyzed via quantum state tomography, to reveal how characteristic properties such as correlations in the output state change across the phase transition. Moreover, we use the results to determine the phase boundaries of the model.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <title>Block encoding by signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all - Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>Precision evaluation of the $\eta$- and $\eta'$-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next to the $\pi^0$ pole, $\eta$ and $\eta'$ intermediate states give rise to the leading singularities of the hadronic light-by-light tensor, resulting in sizable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$. The strength of the poles is determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) to two (virtual) photons. We present a calculation of these TFFs that implements a number of low- and high-energy constraints, including the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to 2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, and asymptotic limits. Crucially, we investigate the role of the leading left-hand singularity generated by the exchange of the $a_2$ tensor meson, yielding, for the first time, an estimate of the associated factorization-breaking corrections. Our final results, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, conclude a dedicated effort to evaluate the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering using dispersion relations, amounting to a combined $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: $\eta$ and $\eta'$ poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering are determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) into two virtual photons. These TFFs constitute complicated functions of the photon virtualities that, in turn, can be reconstructed in a dispersive approach from their discontinuities. In this work, we present such an analysis for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ TFFs, implementing a number of constraints from both experiment and theory: normalizations from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, unitarity constraints from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to 2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, singly-virtual data from $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\eta^{(\prime)}$, and the asymptotic behavior predicted by the light-cone expansion. In particular, we account for the leading left-hand-cut singularity by including effects from the $a_2$ resonance, necessitating the solution of an inhomogeneous Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es problem via a carefully chosen path deformation. The resulting TFFs allow us to evaluate the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-pole contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, completing a dedicated program for the lowest-lying pseudoscalar intermediate states in a dispersive approach to hadronic light-by-light scattering, $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>
