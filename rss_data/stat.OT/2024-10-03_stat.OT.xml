      <title>A Modified Satterthwaite (1941,1946) Effective Degrees of Freedom Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective degrees of freedom as proposed by Satterthwaite (1941, 1946), specifically addressing scenarios where component degrees of freedom are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large degrees of freedom, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite's framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson &amp; Rust (1992), as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants.</description>

      <title>Nested Instrumental Variables Design: Switcher Average Treatment Effect, Identification, Efficient Estimation and Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) are a commonly used tool to estimate causal effects from non-randomized data. An archetype of an IV is a randomized trial with non-compliance where the randomized treatment assignment serves as an IV for the non-ignorable treatment received. Under a monotonicity assumption, a valid IV non-parametrically identifies the average treatment effect among a non-identified, latent complier subgroup, whose generalizability is often under debate. In many studies, there could exist multiple versions of an IV, for instance, different nudges to take the same treatment in different study sites in a multicentre clinical trial. These different versions of an IV may result in different compliance rates and offer a unique opportunity to study IV estimates' generalizability. In this article, we introduce a novel nested IV assumption and study identification of the average treatment effect among two latent subgroups: always-compliers and switchers, who are defined based on the joint potential treatment received under two versions of a binary IV. We derive the efficient influence function for the SWitcher Average Treatment Effect (SWATE) and propose efficient estimators. We then propose formal statistical tests of the generalizability of IV estimates under the nested IV framework. We apply the proposed method to the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and study the causal effect of colorectal cancer screening and its generalizability.</description>
