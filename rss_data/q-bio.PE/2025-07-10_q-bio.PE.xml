      <title>Deep learning-based species-area models reveal multi-scale patterns of species richness and turnover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of species within ecosystems is influenced not only by their intrinsic characteristics but also by the spatial scale considered. As the sampled area expands, species richness increases, a phenomenon described by the species-area relationship (SAR). The accumulation dynamics of the SAR results from a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic processes operating at various spatial scales. However, the challenge of collecting exhaustive biodiversity records across spatial scales has hindered a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics. Here, we develop a deep learning approach that leverages sampling theory and small-scale ecological surveys to spatially resolve the scale-dependency of species richness. We demonstrate its performance by predicting the species richness of vascular plant communities across Europe, and evaluate the predictions against an independent dataset of plant community inventories. Our model improves species richness estimates by 32\% and delivers spatially explicit patterns of species richness and turnover for sampling areas ranging from square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Explainable AI techniques further disentangle how drivers of species richness operate across spatial scales. The ability of our model to represent the multi-scale nature of biodiversity is essential to deliver robust biodiversity assessments and forecasts under global change.</description>

      <title>IdentityByDescentDispersal.jl: Inferring dispersal rates with identity-by-descent blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population density and per-generation dispersal rate of a population are central parameters in the study of evolution and ecology. The distribution of recent coalescent events between individuals in space can be used to estimate such quantities through the distribution of identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks. An IBD block is defined as a segment of DNA that has been inherited by a pair of individuals from a common ancestor without being broken by recombination.
  We introduce $\texttt{IdentityByDescentDispersal.jl}$, a Julia package for estimating effective population densities and dispersal rates from observed spatial patterns of IBD shared blocks. It implements the inference scheme proposed by Ringbauer, Coop, and Barton (2017). The package provides a user-friendly interface, supports efficient gradient-based optimization and accommodates arbitrary user-defined demographic models through numerical integration. This software aims to encourage a wider audience to utilize spatial genetic data for estimating dispersal rates, thereby motivating further research and expanding its applications.</description>

      <title>PhyloProfile v2: Scalable Exploration of Multilayered Phylogenetic Profiles via Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic profiles - presence-absence patterns of genes across taxa - are rich information sources for inferring the evolutionary history of genes and gene families. When aggregated across many genes, these profiles can reveal coevolutionary patterns, supporting the prediction of gene functions and interactions. With rapidly growing numbers of sequenced genomes, phylogenetic profiles now routinely encompass thousands of genes and taxa. Existing software fall short in enabling interactive visualization, exploration, and analysis of such large datasets. We present PhyloProfile v2, a comprehensive overhaul of the original PhyloProfile software. This new version introduces major performance improvements along with novel features designed for more efficient data exploration. Notably, PhyloProfile v2 integrates dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize phylogenetic profiles in interactive 2D or 3D space, offering an intuitive overview even for massive datasets. Furthermore, the platform enables seamless transitions from large-scale analyses - spanning millions of orthology relationships - to detailed comparisons of protein feature architectures between specific orthologs. PhyloProfile v2 thus provides a versatile and scalable solution for evolutionary and functional genomics research. PhyloProfile v2 is available as an R package at Bioconductor https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.PhyloProfile.
