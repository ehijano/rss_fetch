      <description>arXiv:2410.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic functions of the ideal Fermi gas at arbitrary temperatures are calculated using the standard Fermi-Stoner functions. The properties of the Fermi-Stoner functions are analyzed. The limiting cases of low-temperature and classical limits with taking into account quantum corrections and the special case of zero chemical potential are considered.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the single-mode description of ultradilute quantum droplets in binary Bose mixtures: A perspective from a microscopic bosonic pairing theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his seminal proposal of quantum droplets in binary Bose mixtures {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{115}, 155302 (2015){]}, Dmitry Petrov suggested that the density ratio $n_{2}/n_{1}$ of the two bosonic components are locked to an optimal value, which is given by the square root of the ratio of the two intra-species scattering lengths, i.e., $\sqrt{a_{11}/a_{22}}$. Due to such a density locking, quantum droplets can be efficiently described by using an extended Gross--Pitaevskii equation within the single-mode approximation. Here, we find that this single-mode description necessarily breaks down in the deep quantum droplet regime, when the attractive inter-species scattering length $a_{12}$ significantly deviates away from the threshold of mean-field collapse (i.e., $-\sqrt{a_{11}a_{22}}$). By applying a bosonic pairing theory, we show that the density ratio is allowed to fluctuate in a sizable interval. Most importantly, the optimal density ratio would be very different from $\sqrt{a_{11}/a_{22}}$, in the case of unequal intra-species scattering lengths ($a_{11}\neq a_{22}$). Our finding might provide a plausible microscopic explanation of the puzzling low critical particle number of quantum droplets, as experimentally observed. Our predicted interval of the density ratio, as a function of the inter-species scattering length, could also be experimentally examined in cold-atom laboratories in the near future.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of integrable and near-integrable atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we explore various aspects of equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for ultracold atomic gases, with a focus on the experimentally realisable one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas. This is a paradigmatic example of an interacting many-body system, which is integrable in the uniform limit and near-integrable otherwise. We first investigate a quantum thermodynamic Otto cycle driven by a quench of interaction strength of a 1D Bose gas. For the case of a sudden quench in a uniform 1D Bose gas, we demonstrate how the performance of this highly nonequilibrium quantum thermal machine may be expressed in terms of atom-atom correlations. Further, we derive a new Maxwell relation which allows one to express entropy, which is generally difficult to ascertain in quantum systems, in terms of Glauber's local second-order correlation function, which are experimentally measurable. We next perform benchmarks of GHD in order to ascertain the regimes where such a theory may be applied, and then utilize it to investigate the interaction strength-driven quantum Otto cycle in a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas. However, to realise such an engine in an experimentally realistic manner would require modelling thermalisation with external reservoirs, which is currently beyond the scope of GHD. Yet, the classical $c$-field stochastic-projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) method is capable of simulating tunnel-coupling pairs of 1D Bose gases in the weakly interacting regime. We therefore utilise this numerical method to simulate the \emph{full} quantum Otto engine cycle, realised through a single working fluid tunnel-coupled to two 1D Bose gases, which constitute the external (hot and cold) reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative fermionized topological phases of strongly interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optical response of a one-dimensional array of strongly nonlinear optical microcavities with alternating tunnel transmissivities, mimicking the paradigmatic Su-Schriefer Heeger model. We show that the non-equilibrium steady state of the bosonic system contains clear signatures of fermionization when the intra-cavity Kerr non-linearity is stronger than both losses and inter-site tunnel coupling. Furthermore, by changing the experimentally controllable parameters detuning and driving strength, in a topologically non-trivial phase, one can selectively excite either the bulk or edge modes or both modes, revealing interesting topological properties in a non-equilibrium system.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Lattice Supersolid of Subradiant Dipolar Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed-matter physics, supersolids refer to many-body quantum states breaking translational symmetry while exhibiting off-diagonal long-range order. This combination is debated for commensurate crystals, however it is accessible in lattice potentials fractionally filled by bosons with extended interactions. Here, we report such lattice supersolid with dipolar excitons confined in a sub-wavelength period potential. Excitons implement the Dicke-Hubbard Hamiltonian controlled by spatially extended dipolar and Dicke correlations. At half lattice-filling, these induce both a condensation in a single sub-radiant state and a dipolar quantum order spontaneously breaking the lattice symmetry. This combination signals a lattice supersolid dissipatively prepared across 8x8 sites. Our study underlines that nanoscopic exciton arrays open a route to explore new frontiers of quantum matter, e.g. many-body entanglement, at the interface with quantum nano-photonics.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Sample Fluctuation for Pure States Certification with Local Random Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remarkable breakthroughs in quantum science and technology are demanding for more efficient methods in analyzing quantum many-body states. A significant challenge in this field is to verify whether a quantum state prepared by quantum devices in the lab accurately matches the desired target pure state. Recent advancements in randomized measurement techniques have provided fresh insights in this area. Specifically, protocols such as classical shadow tomography and shadow overlap have been proposed. Building on these developments, we investigate the fundamental properties of schemes that certify pure quantum states through random local Haar measurements. We derive bounds for sample fluctuations that are applicable regardless of the specific estimator construction. These bounds depend on the operator size distribution of either the observable used to estimate fidelity or the valid variation of the reduced density matrix for arbitrary observables. Our results unveil the intrinsic interplay between operator complexity and the efficiency of quantum algorithms, serving as an obstacle to local certification of pure states with long-range entanglement.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase effects in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the response of dipole superfluids to an applied electromagnetic field, drawing parallels to the Meissner effect in conventional superconductors. While superconductors, consisting of electric monopoles, interact with magnetic fields via the Aharonov-Bohm phase, magnetic-dipole superfluids -- composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic dipole moments -- interact with electric fields through the Aharonov-Casher phase, where spatially modulating electric fields act as pseudo-magnetic fields. This leads to a distinct response compared to conventional superconductors. We develop a phenomenological theory to describe this behavior, revealing that the magnetic-dipole superfluid under a pseudo-magnetic field forms a vortex lattice, separated by singular domain walls where the pseudo-magnetic field and the charge density diverge. A similar effect is predicted in electric-dipole superfluids, where electric and magnetic roles are reversed, establishing the singular domain wall formation as a fundamental property of dipole condensates.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fault-tolerant Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes enable the protection and correction of quantum information in a single continuous variable system. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Floquet Hamiltonian engineering. We construct the target Hamiltonian directly from the target state and engineer the codes states with an adiabatic ramp protocol. We introduce a new universal set of quantum lattice gate composed of only one type of gate element, and develop a systematic decomposition of complex code state preparation and transformation processes into sequences of quantum lattice gates. We apply our method to three basic code states engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and transformation. We also discuss the automatic quantum error correction against photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical origin of suppressed quantum chaos in Rydberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surprisingly long-lasting oscillations observed in the dynamics of highly excited states of chains of Rydberg atoms defy the expectation that interacting systems should thermalize fast. The phenomenon is reminiscent of wavepackets in quantum billiards that trace classical periodic orbits. While analogs of the associated scarred eigenfunctions have been found for Rydberg chains, an underlying classical limit hosting periodic orbits has remained elusive. Here we generalize the Rydberg (pseudospin $S=1/2$) system to a chain of arbitrary spin $S$. Its classical limit features unexpectedly stable periodic orbits that are essential to understand the emergence of robust, parametrically suppressed quantum chaoticity, with semi-classical coherence times diverging as $\sqrt{S}$. The classical limit successfully explains several empirical features of the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Induced Nonlinear Spin Dynamics in an Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects are the root of interesting phenomena such as masers and lasers, and play a significant role in science and engineering. In spin systems, nonlinear spin dynamics is crucial for the prediction of complex dynamical behavior such as self-organizing oscillation, with applications ranging from spin masers and time crystals to precision measurement. However, when a spin system operates in a static magnetic field, how the inhomogeneity of the field affects its dynamics is a primary concern. Here we study the dynamics of a collection of spins with multiple Larmor frequencies for modeling a static inhomogeneous magnetic field, and reveal that due to the nonlinearity induced by a feedback scheme, the spin system exhibits much richer stable dynamical phases, including quasi-periodic orbits and chaos besides the usual limit cycles emerged in previous works. These phases are generally applicable to coupled nonlinear spin systems, even with more than two intrinsic Larmor frequencies or in continuum cases. Furthermore, we discuss their robustness against the experimental noises and the feasibility of realization in several spin systems. Our findings contribute to future observation of nonlinear dynamical phases and prospective applications in precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general kinetic approach to studying high-frequency collective excitations in arbitrary-spin quantum gases. To this end, we formulate a many-body Hamiltonian that includes the multipolar exchange interaction as well as the coupling of a multipolar moment with an external field. By linearizing the respective collisionless kinetic equation, we find a general dispersion equation that allows us to examine the high-frequency collective modes for arbitrary-spin atoms obeying one or another quantum statistics. We analyze some of its particular solutions describing spin waves and zero sound for Bose and Fermi gases.</description>

Abstract: Dipolar supersolids--quantum states which are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while its solid nature remains uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work, we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound: a supersonic shear wave. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-Temperature Zeros for Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the zeros of complex partition functions, such as Lee-Yang zeros and Fisher zeros, have been pivotal in characterizing temperature-driven phase transitions, extending this concept to zero temperature remains an open question. In this work, we propose a solution to this issue by calculating the imaginary-temperature zeros (ITZs), which are defined as the roots of the imaginary-temperature partition function. We illustrate the analytical properties of ITZs in the transverse-field Ising chain, showing that the ITZs' distribution can distinguish between various phases and signify the critical exponents. Universal singular behaviors manifest in such quantities as the edge density of ITZs and the magnetization, with the scaling exponents remarkably differing from those in Lee-Yang theory. We further illuminate the consistency between ITZs and the zeros of the spectral form factor, which offers a practical path for the experimental detection of ITZs.</description>

Abstract: The electronic ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) band insulator with time-reversal ($\Theta$) symmetry or time-reversal times a discrete translation ($\Theta T_{1/2}$) symmetry is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-valued topological invariant and characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response. Here we demonstrate by explicit calculation in model $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological insulator thin-films that whereas the magnetoelectric response is localized at the surface in the $\Theta$ symmetry (nonmagnetic) case, it is nonuniversally partitioned between surface and interior contributions in the $\Theta T_{1/2}$ (antiferromagnetic) case, while remaining quantized. Within our model the magnetic field induced polarization arises entirely from an anomalous $\mathscr{N}=0$ Landau level subspace within which the projected Hamiltonian is a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose topological properties are consistent with those of the starting 3D model. We identify a new connection between the ground-state geometry of that 3D model and surface-interior partitioning in thin films.</description>
