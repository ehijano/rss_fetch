      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>

      <title>Flavor physics at the EIC with b-jet tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an approximate conserved quantum number (defined as "$b$-Parity" in [1]) of the Standard Model (SM): $b_P=(-1)^n$, where $n$ is the number of produced $b$-jets in the reaction $e + p/A \to n \cdot j_b +X$, to explore new TeV-scale flavor-changing interactions involving the 3rd generation quarks at the EIC; simply by counting the number of $b$-jets in the final state. In particular, the SM single and di-jet production at the EIC which occur through charge current interactions, $e + p/A \to j + \!\not\!E_T$ and $e + p/A \to 2\cdot j + \!\not\!E_T$, are $b_P$-even since the $b_P$-violating (i.e, $b_P=-1$) SM signals for these processes are necessarily CKM suppressed and, therefore, have a vanishingly small production rate. In contrast, new flavor physics can generate $b_P=-1$ signals at the EIC whose only significant SM background is due to $b$-jet misidentification. We thus show that $b_P$ can be used as a simple and sensitive probe of new flavor violating physics; specifically, we find that counting single $b$-jet events in $e + p/A \to j + \!\not\!E_T$ at the EIC with a center-of-mass (CM) energy of $\sqrt{s} \sim 140$ GeV, can probe scales of new physics up to $\Lambda \sim {\cal O}(5)$ TeV for a certain type of new chiral flavor-changing physics in 3rd generation interactions. This is remarkably more than 30 times larger than the assumed EIC CM energy and it critically depends on the $b$-tagging efficiency and purity as well as the feasibility of electron-beam polarization. The sensitivity of the di-jet process, $e + p/A \to 2j + \!\not\!E_T$, to these type of new physics is reduced compared to the single-jet channel.</description>

      <title>Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter as a Probe of Inflationary Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos offer a minimal and testable explanation for dark matter (DM), with their radiative decay actively searched for in X-ray observations. We show that cold sterile neutrino DM can be efficiently produced during reheating from inflaton decays with a tiny branching ratio, ${\rm BR}\lesssim 10^{-4}$. This production mechanism opens regions of parameter space where the active-sterile mixing is small enough to evade current X-ray constraints while reproducing the observed DM abundance. We systematically map the viable parameter space in terms of the sterile neutrino mass, mixing angle, inflaton mass, reheating temperature, and branching ratio. We further demonstrate that sterile neutrino DM can serve as a probe of inflationary reheating, with future X-ray observations capable of setting lower bounds on the reheating temperature several orders of magnitude above the existing bound from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Estimating JUNO's Sensitivity to Solar Neutrino-to-antineutrino Conversion and Neutrino Magnetic Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated JUNO's sensitivity to a possible conversion of solar neutrinos into antineutrinos via the spin-flavor precession (SFP) mechanism, and assessed the implications for constraining the neutrino-magnetic moment (NMM). Using a sensitivity-based framework appropriate for counting experiments with no prior observations, we derive 90\% C.L.\ ensemble-average sensitivities on the solar antineutrino flux for 1.8--16.8 MeV and 8.0--16.8 MeV. For the entire energy window, the results do not improve the restrictions of other experiments; the relevance occurs in the highes-energy window. In this window, we report a flux of $\phi_{\mathrm{lim}}\le 4.01\times10^{1}\ \mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ and a probability of $P_{\nu_e\rightarrow\bar{\nu}_e}\le 2.07\times10^{-5}$, the latter normalized to the ${}^8$B flux above threshold, $\Phi_{\rm SSM}(E&gt;8~\mathrm{MeV})$. Assuming transverse solar magnetic fields of $B_\perp=50$ and $100$~kG, the corresponding magnetic-moment sensitivities are $\mu_\nu\le 7.27\times10^{-11}\,\mu_B$ and $3.64\times10^{-11}\,\mu_B$ in the high-energy window. These results highlight that JUNO has the potential to achieve sensitivities comparable to the most stringent astrophysical limits; in particular, the high-energy selection (8.0--16.8~MeV) provides a sensitivity that is competitive with current results, while the full-energy window remains primarily limited by near-reactor backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A Direct Algebraic Pathway to Hadronic Observables in the Contact Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel algebraic framework for computing hadron properties directly within the contact interaction model. Utilizing Fierz transformations, the method recasts the Bethe-Salpeter dynamics into equations for a minimal set of \emph{projected amplitudes} for bound-state static properties and form factors, bypassing the conventional need for the meson wave function. This approach is fully demonstrated for the vector meson, enabling the direct extraction of its decay constants and form factors. The formalism provides a more efficient and unified pathway to hadron observables, with clear potential for extension to baryons and more sophisticated interactions.</description>

      <title>Fully-strange tetraquarks: fall-apart decays and experimental candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presents a systematic analysis of the fall-apart decays for the $1S$, $1P$, and $2S$-wave fully-strange tetraquark states. It shows that most of the fully-strange tetraquark states have a relatively narrow fall-apart decay width of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV. The newly observed axial-vector state $X(2300)$ at BESIII may favor the low-lying $1S$-wave $1^{+-}$ state $T_{(4s)1^{+-}}(2323)$, while the $X(2500)$ resonance observed in the earlier BESIII experiment may favor the low-lying $1P$-wave $0^{-+}$ state $T_{(4s)0^{-+}}(2481)$. Some fully-strange tetraquark states predicted in theory can be searched for in their dominant fall-apart decay channels in experiment, such as $\phi\phi$, $\phi\phi(1680)$, $\eta^{(\prime)}\phi$, $\eta^{(\prime)}h_1(1415)$, and $\phi f_2^{\prime}(1525)$, to which they have relatively large couplings.</description>

      <title>Role of $\Sigma(1660)$ in the $K^- p \to\pi^0\pi^0\Sigma^0$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes of $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ and $K^- p \to \pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ are studied within the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the ``background" contribution from the $u$-channel nucleon pole term, contribution from the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$ is also considered. For the $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ reaction, we perform a calculation for the total and differential cross sections by considering the contribution from the $\Sigma(1660)$ intermediate resonance decaying into $\pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ with $\Lambda(1405)$ decaying into $\pi^0 \Sigma^0$. With our model parameters, the available experimental data on both the $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ and $K^- p \to \pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ reactions can be fairly well reproduced. It is shown that we really need the contribution from the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance, and that these experimental measurements could be used to determine some properties of the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Why is the $Z_c(3900)$ absent in the $h_c\pi$ final state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the exotic hadronic states $Z_c(3900)$, $Z_c(4020)$, $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ within the framework of Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS) and its violation. By constructing S-wave contact interactions between elastic ($D\bar{D}^*/D^*\bar{D}^*$ or $B\bar{B}^*/B^*\bar{B}^*$) and inelastic ($J/\psi\pi, h_c\pi$ or $\Upsilon\pi$, $h_b\pi$) channels, we solve the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to obtain physical production amplitudes and perform a global fit to experimental invariant-mass spectra. Our results demonstrate a striking difference between the charm and bottom sectors: HQSS violation is negligible in the bottom system, leading to comparable peak structures for both $Z_b$ states in all hidden-bottom decay channels. In contrast, significant HQSS breaking is required to describe the $Z_c$ system, where the violation is predominantly concentrated in the elastic interactions. This explains the observed selectivity: $Z_c(3900)$ appears prominently only in $J/\psi\pi$, while $Z_c(4020)$ appears only in $h_c\pi$. Pole analysis confirms the molecular nature of the states, with the $Z_c(4020)$ likely arising from a threshold cusp effect. The model's robustness is verified against variations of the form factor and cutoff, showing stable results.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly: from vacuum to Columbia plot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a low-energy effective approach, the extended linear sigma model, to study realizations of the $U(1)_A$ anomaly with different operators, linear and quadratic in the 't Hooft determinant. After discussing the parameterization in agreement with vacuum's phenomenology, we investigate the influence of these different anomaly terms on the Columbia plot: the square of the 't Hooft determinant favors a cross-over for small quark masses. Finally, we also discuss the extension of the 't Hooft determinant to cases in which different mesonic multiplets interact with each other. Novel chiral anomalous interaction terms involving excited (pseudo)scalar states, pseudovector, and pseudotensor mesons are expressed via a mathematical extension of the determinant, denoted as a polydeterminant.</description>

      <title>Addicted to Flavour: 1976-2026</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics.</description>

      <title>Topological quantization of vector meson anomalous couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a new anomalous term in hidden local symmetry that enforces the topological quantization of vector-meson anomalous couplings. Unlike existing formulations in the literature, which introduce several unquantized coefficients, our term removes this freedom by fixing the couplings to quantized, topologically determined values. We further conjecture that it saturates the anomaly, explaining the success of vector-meson dominance while pinpointing where saturation must fail. High-precision measurements of $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma^*$ form factors at BESIII and the Super $\tau$-Charm Facility can provide a definitive experimental discriminator of this quantized picture.</description>

      <title>Beyond Form Factors: Precise Angular Tests in Hadronic $\tau$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semileptonic $\tau$ decays mainly proceed via interactions between charged lepton and quark currents. The hadronization of the quark current is intrinsically nonperturbative and generally cannot be addressed analytically. In these proceedings, we propose using symmetry arguments alone to construct clean angular observables, which, within the Standard Model and in the absence of long-distance electromagnetic corrections, remain form-factor independent. These predictions can be experimentally tested, and any observed deviation could signal either effects of physics beyond the Standard Model or provide a clean benchmark for long-distance electromagnetic corrections. We also perform a first estimate of the expected impact of new physics in an EFT framework.</description>

      <title>Axion Masses as an Inevitable Consequence of Supersymmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a supersymmetric framework in which soft supersymmetry-breaking effects provide the dominant origin of Peccei--Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking and axion mass generation. In the supersymmetric limit the theory possesses an exact PQ symmetry and a massless axion, while the inclusion of soft terms proportional to the gravitino mass induces spontaneous PQ breaking, stabilizes the saxion direction, and generates a mass for the axion. As a consequence, the axion, saxion, and axino masses are all controlled by the supersymmetry-breaking scale, leading to a correlated and predictive spectrum of axion-like states.
  The presence of explicit soft PQ-breaking terms raises the question of vacuum alignment and CP violation. We show that although the axion mass does not originate from QCD instantons, the induced strong CP phase is parametrically suppressed by the hierarchy between the QCD-induced and soft-induced axion masses. As a result, the explicit breaking does not generate an observable CP-violating vacuum angle across the parameter space of interest.
  We analyze the phenomenological implications of this scenario, including axion lifetimes, axion--photon couplings, and laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints. Direct confrontations with beam-dump and collider searches, together with Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds, demonstrate that a substantial region of parameter space remains viable and testable. The framework thus provides a self-consistent and phenomenologically rich realization of axion-like particles whose masses arise predominantly from soft supersymmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Effect of event classification on the Tsallis-thermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze identified hadron spectra in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV measured by ALICE within a non-extensive statistical framework. Spectra classified by multiplicity, flattenicity, and spherocity were fitted with the Tsallis-Pareto distribution, and the parameters were studied on the Tsallis-thermometer. Multiplicity and flattenicity classes follow a previously observed scaling, while the non-extensivity parameter shows a distinct sensitivity to the spherocity. A data-driven parametrization confirms a proportionality between the Tsallis temperature and mean transverse momentum, offering a simple estimate of the effective temperature. These results highlight the ability of the Tsallis-thermometer to capture both multiplicity and event-shape effects, linking soft and hard processes in small systems.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO BFKL impact factors for quarkonium hadroproduction in NRQCD: the case of ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading order calculation of the impact factors for hadroproduction of $S$-wave quarkonium states within the BFKL formalism. We present the computation of the real-emission contributions which completes the recent one of one-loop virtual corrections by one of us for the impact factors for the ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ NRQCD states. We prove the cancellation of soft divergences between real and virtual contributions, and that the surviving collinear singularities are compatible with factorisation up to one loop for a novel class of processes where BFKL resummation can be applied. Our work indeed represents the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in the BFKL framework and paves the way to first next-to-leading-logarithmic-precision studies for hadroproduction of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Real-time Gravitational Wave Response in Thermal Spinning fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the spin content of the thermal plasmas affects the propagation of gravitational waves in a radiation-dominated universe. As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup.</description>

      <title>Light-Flavour Resonance Production in High-Energy Heavy-Ion Collisions: An Experimental Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonances provide sensitivity to the late-stage dynamics of heavy-ion collisions, as their lifetimes are comparable to the duration of the hadronic phase. This review summarizes state-of-the-art measurements of light-flavour mesonic and baryonic resonances, including $\rho$(770), $K^{\star}$(892), $\phi$(1020), $\Delta$(1232), $\Lambda^{\star}$(1520), $\Sigma^{\star}$(1385) and $\Xi^\star$(1530), in pp, p-A and A-A collisions at SPS, RHIC and the LHC. Systematic trends in yields, mass and width modifications, transverse-momentum spectra, nuclear modification factors, and particle ratios reveal the interplay of re-scattering and regeneration, medium-induced suppression, and the development of collective dynamics with increasing system size and multiplicity. Anisotropic flow results confirm the coupling of resonances to the expanding medium, while recent vector-meson spin-alignment measurements offer fresh insights into hadronization mechanisms and local fields. Ultra-peripheral collisions provide vacuum-like baselines for isolating in-medium effects. Emerging opportunities for charm-resonance studies in upcoming high-luminosity experiments are also outlined.Together, these advances demonstrate the important role of resonance measurements in constraining the space-time evolution of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable and unitary nonlocal quantum field theory with CPT violation and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a common belief that any relativistic nonlocal quantum field theory encounters either the problem of renormalizability or unitarity or both of them. It is also known that any local relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) possesses the CPT symmetry. In this Letter we show that a previously proposed nonlocal Lorentz invariant QFT, which violates the CPT theorem, is both renormalizable and unitary, thus being a first presented example in the literature of such a nonlocal theory. The theory satisfies the requirement of causality as well. A further generalization of such a nonlocal QFT to include the gauge theories is also envisaged. In particular, dressing such a Standard Model with a CP violating phase, will make the theory satisfying most of the necessary criteria to finally explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe by a viable QFT. As for the necessity of baryon number violation, there are hopefully several possibilities such as by GUT and electroweak baryogenesis, leptogenesis or sphalerons.</description>

      <title>Extracting scattering phase shift in quantum mechanics on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.</description>

Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.</description>

      <title>Constraints on lepton flavor universal and non-universal New Physics in $b\, \to\, s\, \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays: a global SMEFT survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flavor-changing neutral current semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons provide an excellent platform for indirectly probing New Physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM). Recent measurements of lepton flavor universality (LFU) ratios such as $R_K$, $R_{K^*}$, and $R_\phi$ are consistent with SM predictions, thereby reducing earlier hints of LFU violation. Nevertheless, notable tensions persist in individual branching fractions -- for instance $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ e^+ e^-)$, which deviate at the $4\sigma$--$5\sigma$ level in the low-$q^2$ region ($[1.1,6]$ GeV$^2$). Similarly, the angular observable $P'_5$ in $B \to K^{*} \mu^+ \mu^-$ shows a $3.3\sigma$ deviation, while $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-)$ departs from the SM by $3.6\sigma$. Although such discrepancies could in principle originate from underestimated hadronic effects, they may also indicate possible NP contributions. In this work, we perform a global fit to the latest $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ data within the framework of dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Our analysis systematically incorporates hadronic uncertainties from form factors, non-factorizable corrections, and input parameters, thereby providing a balanced assessment of the NP interpretation. We allow for NP contributions not only in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions but also in $b \to s e^+ e^-$ channels, thus testing both lepton flavor universal (LFU) and lepton flavor universality violating (LFUV) NP scenarios. The interplay between these possibilities yields distinctive signatures in branching fractions, angular observables, and $\Delta$-observables, offering a comprehensive view of the current flavor anomalies.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Anti-Electron Neutrinos at High-Energy Neutrino Experiments: Identification Strategies and Physics Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing and proposed high energy neutrino experiments have excellent muon charge identification capabilities, enabling the distinction of $\nu_\mu$ and $\bar \nu_\mu$ charged current interactions. In contrast, distinguishing electrons and positrons from $\nu_e$ and $\bar \nu_e$ interactions is typically impossible, as they quickly interact within the characteristically dense detector material and fail to reach the spectrometer. In this letter, we propose a compact and cost-effective plastic target, placed right before the spectrometer, to maximize the rate of electrons and positrons that reach the spectrometer before interacting. We demonstrate that, when installed at the FASER experiment, the Forward Physics Facility, or SHiP, this setup could enable the first separate measurement of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ cross sections at high energy. Additionally, this setup opens new opportunities to study forward particle production at collider neutrino experiments, such as constraining forward $\Lambda$ hyperon production, and, by reducing flux uncertainties, significantly improve limits on non-standard neutrino interactions in neutral currents.</description>

Abstract: Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwell's equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the extraordinary photon and the monopole belong to the dark sector, and the ordinary photon and the electron to the non-dark sector. A mixing interaction transforms both electron and monopole into dyons generating experimental consequences for indirect and direct monopole detection which we analyze.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Scalar Dark Matter Co-Scattering in EFT with Monophoton Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the co-scattering mechanism for dark matter production in an EFT framework which contains new $Z_2$-odd singlets, namely two fermions $N_{1,2}$ and a real scalar $\chi$. The singlet scalar $\chi$ is the dark matter candidate. The dimension-5 operators play a vital role to set the observed DM relic density. We focus on a nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the $Z_2$ odd particles to allow for a significant contribution from the co-scattering or co-annihilation mechanisms. We present two benchmark points where either of the two mechanisms primarily set the DM relic abundance. The main constraint on the model at the LHC arise from the ATLAS mono-$\gamma$ search. We obtain the parameter space allowed by the observed relic density and the mono-$\gamma$ search after performing a scan over the key parameters, the masses $M_{N_{1,2}}, M_\chi$ and couplings $c_3^\prime, y^\prime_{11,22}$. We find the region of parameter space where the relic abundance is set primarily by the co-scattering mechanism while being allowed by the LHC search. We also determine how the model can be further probed at the HL-LHC via the mono-$\gamma$ signature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw model to realise leptogenesis from the co-annihilation of dark sector particles. The type-I seesaw model is extended with a singlet fermion and two singlet scalars charged under a $Z_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z_{2}$-odd singlet scalar is the dark matter candidate. Here the usual type-I seesaw mechanism generates neutrino mass, and a net lepton asymmetry is generated from the co-annihilation of the dark matter and the $Z_2$-odd singlet fermion. The $Z_{2}$-even singlet scalar is important in dark matter phenomenology. Successful leptogenesis is possible at TeV-scale, unlike the vanilla case. This minimal extension provides an elegant explanation of successful leptogenesis with direct connection to the dark matter abundance in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Roles of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore phase structures and hadron mass spectra in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors where the sign problem disappears. We particularly focus on $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We employ an $N_f=2+2$ linear sigma model based on the $SU(8)$ Pauli-G\"{u}rsey symmetry to describe negative-parity as well as positive-parity hadrons, for which low-energy excitations are appropriately described particularly in the baryon superfluid phase with light diquark condensates. As a result, the strange chiral condensate is found to be enhanced in the superfluid phase owing to the flavor-mixing structure of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We also confirm this enhancement by means of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Besides, our present analysis predicts the existence of a novel superfluid phase where heavy diquarks condense in dense regime. The topological susceptibility with $2+2$ flavors from the viewpoints of the anomaly effects and chiral-symmetry restoration is investigated. Furthermore, we derive a complete inverse mass hierarchy for negative-parity diquarks with sufficient anomaly effects. Our findings are expected to provide future lattice simulations with useful information on flavor-symmetry violation from the $U(1)$ axial anomaly aspects in cold and dense two-color QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Boson Decays: Updates</title>

Abstract: In this contribution, new developments for the Standard Model Higgs-boson decays will be summarized. This addresses extensions of the grids used by {\tt Hdecay} to implement finite NLO mass effects for $H\to gg$ as well as explicit numbers for the branching fraction for the strange-Yukawa induced part of $H\to s\bar s$ together with the related uncertainties. In addition, first results of the strong and weak Dalitz decays of the Higgs-boson decays $H\to s\bar s + g/\gamma$ are presented. The Dalitz decays define the separation between the Yukawa-induced part and the continuum, that is not induced by the strange-Yukawa coupling, and thus pave the way towards a solid determination of the strange-Yukawa coupling at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, but will also be relevant for solid bounds on the strange-Yukawa coupling at the LHC.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Hadronic Matter on Parton Energy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified thermal distributions (dispersion relations) are introduced within both the MATTER and LBT event generators used to describe jet modification in a heavy-ion collision, within the JETSCAPE framework. Hard partons, propagating through dense matter, scatter off the partonic substructure of the medium, leading to stimulated emission, accompanied by recoiling medium partons. We introduce a simple modification, a multiplicative $(1 + a/T)$ correction to the dispersion relation of quarks and gluons (equivalent to an effective fugacity). This leads to calculated transport coefficients (e.g. $\hat{q}/T^3$) showing the expected behavior of depreciating at lower temperatures, including within the hot hadronic gas. This simple modification recovers the light-like dispersion relations at high temperatures, and introduces an excess depreciation factor for parton populations at lower temperatures, allowing partonic energy loss and recoil calculations to be extended into the hadronic phase. This modified distribution, in combination with initial state cold nuclear matter effects (shadowing), is used to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic anisotropy of jets and leading hadrons, over multiple centralities and collision energies.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can lead to the formation of a black hole (BH) condensate system. We thoroughly investigate the accretion effect on the evolution of this system, and the gravitational wave signals it emits in the presence of multiple superradiance modes. Assuming the multiplication of the BH mass and scalar mass as a small number, we obtain the analytical approximations of all important quantities, which can be directly applied to phenomenological studies. In addition, we confirm that accretion could significantly enhance the gravitational wave (GW) emission and reduce its duration, and show that the GW beat signature is similarly modified.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. However, if the integrated additional term $\chi=(g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4xL(x) $ is not zero, it is not integer nor gauge invariant, so that VNABI would not be allowed in QCD. Using the Wu-Yang arguments, it is however proved that $\chi$ becomes vanishing. $\chi$ is evaluated also in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). When the gradient flow method is used, the term $\chi$ tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ($\tau$). The bosonic definition of the topological charge $Q_t$ and its Abelian counterpart $Q_a\equiv (g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4x \Tr(f_{\mu\nu}f_{\mu\nu}^*)$ written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When $\chi$ is zero, $Q_a$=3$Q_t$ is expected theoretically.</description>

      <title>AliCPT Sensitivity to Cosmic Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first assessment of the Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope's (AliCPT) sensitivity to the reheating epoch after cosmic inflation, based on its ability to detect primordial gravitational waves. We consider three models of inflation, an $\alpha$-attractor T-model, RGI inflation and QCD-driven warm inflation. Assuming a fiducial value of $r=0.01$, we find that AliCPT-1, in its fully loaded focal plane detector configuration and combined with Planck, can provide measurements of the order of magnitude of the reheating temperature with an accuracy around $10\%$. For QCD-driven warm inflation this can be translated into a constraint on the inflaton coupling to gluons, which can be probed independently in axion search experiments. Our results constitute the first demonstration of AliCPT's ability to probe the initial temperature of the hot big bang and the microphysical parameter connecting cosmic inflation and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors (spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect enhanced by e-folding factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a residue sum of contour integrals of the frequency or momentum in the phase-integral formulation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>

Abstract: Beam dump experiments represent an effective way to probe new physics in a parameter space, where new particles have feeble couplings to the Standard Model sector and masses below the GeV scale. The LUXE experiment, designed primarily to study strong-field quantum electrodynamics, can be used also as a photon beam dump experiment with a unique reach for new spin-0 particles in the $10-350~\mathrm{MeV}$ mass and $10^{-6}-10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ couplings to photons ranges. This is achieved via the ``New Physics search with Optical Dump'' (NPOD) concept. While prior estimations were obtained with a simplified model of the experimental setup, in this work we present a systematic study of the new physics reach in the full, realistic experimental apparatus, including an existing detector to be used in the LUXE NPOD context. We furthermore investigate updated scenarios of LUXE's experimental plan and confirm that our results are in agreement with the original estimations of a background-free operation.</description>

Abstract: In the presence of an ultralight scalar or vector boson, a spinning black hole will be spun down through the superradiant instability. We use spin measurements from gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, in particular the heavy binary black hole merger event GW231123, along with the lower-mass GW190517 event, to constrain the existence of ultralight bosons. We disfavor scalars with masses in the range of $[0.55, 11]\times 10^{-13}$ eV and vectors in the range of $[0.11, 18]\times 10^{-13}$ eV, making only a conservative assumption that the black hole lifetimes are greater than $10^5$ years. The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the highest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic or gravitational wave observations. We map these constraints to axion and dark photon models with interactions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing radial flow fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC and LHC energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the transverse-momentum differential radial flow fluctuations observable $v_0(p_T)$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC ($\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}{\,=\,}200$ GeV) and LHC ($\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}{\,=\,}2.76$ and 5.02 TeV) energies. Using a multistage hydrodynamic model, we assess the sensitivity of $v_0(p_T)$ to a wide range of physical effects, including bulk and shear viscosities, off-equilibrium corrections at particlization, the presence of a hadronic afterburner, and the nucleon size in the initial conditions. By employing complementary rescaling strategies, we demonstrate how different physical effects leave distinct imprints on the shape of $v_0(p_T)$. A combined double-rescaling of $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ versus $p_T/\langle p_T \rangle$ reveals a universality across a wide range of energies and model assumptions in the low-$p_T$ regime, a robust signature of collective behavior. This allows us to disentangle the universal dynamics of the bulk medium from model-specific features that emerge at higher $p_T$. Our results establish $v_0(p_T)$ as a powerful and complementary observable for constraining QGP transport properties and initial-state granularity, offering a unique probe of the created QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Convection-Driven Multi-Scale Magnetic Fields Determine the Observed Solar-Disk Gamma Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar disk is a continuous source of GeV--TeV gamma rays. The emission is thought to originate from hadronic Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with the gas in the photosphere and uppermost convection zone after being reflected by solar magnetic fields. Despite this general understanding, existing theoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and the uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale magnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also generating turbulence-scale Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that the larger-scale filamentary field shapes the overall gamma-ray emission spectrum, and the Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence is critical for further suppressing the gamma-ray emission spectrum below $\sim 100$~GeV. For a standard Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence level, our model's predicted spectrum slope from 1~GeV to 1~TeV is in excellent agreement with observations from Fermi-LAT and HAWC, an important achievement. The predicted absolute flux is a factor of 2--5 lower than the observed data; we outline future directions to resolve this discrepancy. The key contribution of our work is providing a new theoretical framework for using solar disk gamma-ray observations to probe hadronic GCR transport in the lower solar atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Action Integral for Photon-Photon Interactions in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating through vacuum can polarize virtual electron-positron pairs; this polarization, in turn, nonlinearly modifies their propagation. A semi-classical nonlinear wave equation describing the propagation is derived from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian density, which captures vacuum polarization effects up to the one-loop level. Here, we present a reduced-action-integral approach that enables rapid modeling of nonlinear phenomena arising from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian. Application of the variational principle to the reduced action provides equations of motion for familiar light-pulse parameters, such as spot size, phase, polarization, and phase-front curvature, without requiring full-field simulations. Three examples demonstrate the utility of the approach: phase modulation, birefringence, and frequency mixing.</description>

      <title>Approximating Feynman Integrals Using Complete Monotonicity and Stieltjes Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel numerical approaches for computing Feynman integrals based on their complete monotonicity (CM) and Stieltjes properties. The first method uses that scalar Feynman integrals are CM, meaning that all their derivatives have a fixed sign, in the Euclidean kinematic region. This imposes strong constraints on the function space. Simultaneously, these integrals obey systems of linear differential equations with respect to kinematic parameters. By imposing that the solutions to these differential equations satisfy complete monotonicity across the Euclidean region, we develop an efficient and highly constraining numerical bootstrap method. We provide a proof of principle of the power of our approach by applying it to a class of multi-loop Feynman integrals with internal masses. The second method is based on a refinement of CM. We prove that Feynman integrals, within a certain range of parameters, such as dimension and propagator exponents, are not only CM but in fact Stieltjes functions. The latter can be described efficiently by Pad\'e approximants that are known to converge in the cut complex plane. This means that these representations are valid also in analytically continued kinematics, such as physical scattering regions. These insights allow us to obtain rational approximations to Feynman integrals from minimal information, such as a Taylor expansion about a soft limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to a 20-loop banana-type Feynman integral. Finally, we comment on a number of extensions of these novel avenues for computing Feynman integrals.</description>
