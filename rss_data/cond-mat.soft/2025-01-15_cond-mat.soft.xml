      <title>Elastic Interaction of Pressurized Cavities in Hyperelastic Media: Attraction and Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study computationally investigates the elastic interaction of two pressurized cylindrical cavities in a 2D hyperelastic medium. Unlike linear elasticity, where interactions are exclusively attractive, nonlinear material models (neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce) exhibit both attraction and repulsion between the cavities. A critical pressure-shear modulus ratio governs the transition, offering a pathway to manipulate cavity configurations through material and loading parameters. At low ratios, the interactions are always attractive; at higher ratios, both attractive and repulsive regimes exist depending on the separation between the cavities. Effect of strain stiffening on these interactions are also analyzed. These insights bridge theoretical and applied mechanics, with implications for soft material design and subsurface engineering.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</description>

      <title>Heterarchical Granular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two most commonly used methods to model the behaviour of granular flows are discrete element and continuum mechanics simulations. These approaches concentrate on the deterministic description of particle or bulk material motion. Unlike these approaches, this paper introduces an alternative model that describes the stochastic dynamics of the void spaces under the action of gravity. The model includes several key phenomena which are observed in deforming granular media, such as segregation, mixing, and an angle of repose. These mechanisms are modelled heterarchically using both spatial and microstructural internal coordinates. Key aspects of the model include its ability to describe both stable and flowing states of granular media based on a solid fraction cut-off, and the influence of particle size on flow, segregation, and mixing. The model is validated with simulations of column collapse and silo discharge.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics-driven phase-locking and collective motility of sessile active dumbbells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective motion is a phenomenon observed across length scales in nature, from bacterial swarming and tissue migration to the flocking of animals. The mechanisms underlying this behavior vary significantly depending on the biological system, ranging from hydrodynamic and chemical interactions in bacteria to mechanical forces in epithelial tissues and social alignment in animal groups. While collective motion often arises from the coordinated activity of independently motile agents, this work explores a novel context: the emergence of collective motion in systems of non-motile active agents. Inspired by the oscillatory shape dynamics observed in suspended cells such as neutrophils and fibroblasts, we model active dumbbells exhibiting limit-cycle oscillations in shape as a minimal representation of such systems.Through computational simulations, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic interactions between these dumbbells lead to three key phenomena: a density-dependent transition from sessile to collective motion, hydrodynamics-induced phase separation, and synchronization of oscillatory shape changes. We have explored the role of hydrodynamic interactions on these emergent properties of sessile active dumbbells. These results underscore the critical role of hydrodynamic coupling in enabling and organizing collective behaviors in systems lacking intrinsic motility. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the emergent behavior of active matter and its implications for understanding cell motility, tissue dynamics, and the development of bio-inspired materials.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for the progression of dental caries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model for the progression of dental caries is derived. The analysis starts at the microscopic reaction and diffusion process. The local equations are averaged to derive a set of macroscopic equations. The global system includes features such as anisotropic diffusion and local changes in the geometry due to the enamel melting. The equations are then solved numerically. The simulations highlight the effect of anisotropy. In addition we draw conclusions on the progression rate of caries, and discuss them in light of a number of experiments.</description>

      <title>Active and passive crosslinking of cytoskeleton scaffolds tune the effects of cell inclusions on composite structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating cells within active biomaterial scaffolds is a promising strategy to develop forefront materials that can autonomously sense, respond, and alter the scaffold in response to environmental cues or internal cell circuitry. Using dynamic biocompatible scaffolds that can self-alter their properties via crosslinking and motor-driven force-generation opens even greater avenues for actuation and control. However, the design principles associated with engineering active scaffolds embedded with cells are not well established. To address this challenge, we design a dynamic scaffold material of bacteria cells embedded within a composite cytoskeletal network of actin and microtubules that can be passively or actively crosslinked by either biotin-streptavidin or multimeric kinesin motors. Using quantitative microscopy, we demonstrate the ability to embed cells of volume fractions 0.4 to 2% throughout the network without compromising the structural integrity of the network or inhibiting crosslinking or motor-driven dynamics. Our findings suggest that both passive and active crosslinking promote entrainment of cells within the network, while depletion interactions play a more important role in uncrosslinked networks. Moreover, we show that large-scale structures emerge with the addition of cell fractions as low as 0.4%, but these structures do not influence the microscale structural lengthscale of the materials. Our work highlights the potential of our composite biomaterial in designing autonomous materials controlled by cells, and provides a roadmap for effectively coupling cells to complex composite materials with an eye towards using cells as in situ factories to program material modifications.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence in the design of mixtures with super-Gibbs phase coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing the phase behavior of multicomponent mixtures is a rich area with many potential applications. One key question is how more than $M+1$ phases, as would normally be allowed by Gibbs' phase rule at generic temperature in a mixture of $M$ molecular species, can be made to coexist in equilibrium. In the grandcanonical ensemble, such super-Gibbs phase equilibria can be realized by tuning the interactions among the $M$ species. This introduces $\sim M^2$ additional degrees of freedom and hence a superlinear number of phases that can coexist. We show that, surprisingly, there is no straightforward equivalence to the situation in the experimentally relevant canonical ensemble: here only a subset of the grandcanonical phases will generically be realized. This subset is determined by interfacial tensions in addition to bulk free energies. Using a graph-theoretical approach, we determine a sufficient set of inequalities for the interfacial tensions for which all grandcanonical phases are realized so that equivalence of ensembles is effectively restored. We illustrate the design method for a two-component mixture with four coexisting phases and point out the route for generalizing this to a higher number of components.</description>

      <title>Sub-critical athermal flow in disordered materials caused by periodic variations of environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yield stress materials deform irreversibly at a finite strain-rate if loaded with a fixed stress $\sigma$ larger than some critical yield stress $\sigma_c$. When $\sigma&lt;\sigma_c$ deformation is only transient, unless thermal activation plays a role, in which case persistent deformation occurs as a creep activated process. Yet in subcritical athermal conditions we observe that cyclic time variation of system parameters can induce a steady-state flow, with a total deformation that scales linearly with the number of cycles applied. We characterize this phenomenon using well established models in the fields of depinning and yielding transitions. Interestingly, there is an endurance limit $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ for this process to occur, below which the advance is totally suppressed. We discuss implications of our findings to the study of sub-critical evolution of landforms in which periodic variations of external conditions (as for instance daily/seasonal cycles of temperature, humidity, etc.) are expected.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Schmidt bifurcation analysis of a supported compressible elastic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The archetypal instability of a structure is associated with the eponymous Euler beam, modeled as an inextensible curve which exhibits a supercritical bifurcation at a critical compressive load. In contrast, a soft compressible beam is capable of a subcritical instability, a problem that is far less studied, even though it is increasingly relevant in the context of soft materials and structures. Here, we study the stability of a soft extensible elastic beam on an elastic foundation under the action of a compressive axial force, using the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method which we corroborate with numerical calculations. Our calculated bifurcation diagram differs from those associated with the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam, and shows two critical loads, $p^\pm_{\text{cr}}(n)$, for each buckling mode $n$. The beam undergoes a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at $p^+_{\text{cr}}(n)$ for all $n$ and slenderness. Due to the elastic foundation, the lower order modes at $p^-_{\text{cr}}(n)$ exhibit subcritical pitchfork bifurcations, and perhaps surprisingly, the first supercritical pitchfork bifurcation point occurs at a higher critical load. The presence of the foundation makes it harder to buckle the elastic beam, but when it does so, it tends to buckle into a more undulated shape. Overall, we find that an elastic support can lead to a myraid of buckled shapes for the classical elastica and one can tune the substrate stiffness to control desired buckled modes -- an experimentally testable prediction.</description>

      <title>Settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspension of spherical and cubic particles in Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the gravity-driven settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions of spherical and cubic particles within a triply periodic domain. The effect of solid volume fraction on the evolving microstructure of a suspension is numerically examined by employing the Rigid MultiBlob method under Stokes flow conditions. Our simulations accurately reproduce macroscopic trends observed in experiments and show strong agreement with established semi-empirical correlations over a wide range of volume fractions. It is observed that the hydrodynamic interactions between particles and the surrounding fluid dominate the settling mechanism at low to moderate solid volume fractions, whereas, frequent collisions between particles in a highly packed space tend to suppress velocity fluctuations at denser regime. The transport properties for dilute suspensions are found to be primarily shaped by an anisotropic microstructure, though this anisotropy decreases as many-body interactions significantly grow at higher volume fractions. Notably, cubic particles exhibit lower anisotropy in velocity fluctuations compared to spheres, due to more effective momentum and energy transfer from the gravity-driven direction to transverse directions. Moreover, cubic particles also display higher velocity fluctuations and particle rebounding after collisions, which may create a transient tendency for cubes to move against gravity more readily than spheres. The distinctive behaviors of cubic and spherical particles can notably influence the efficiency of size segregation in bidisperse mixtures. Interestingly, local velocity fluctuation intensity increases for both particle types in mixed suspensions, affecting the local sedimentation velocity field. Overall, spherical particles are found to settle faster than cubes at low to moderate volume fractions.</description>

      <title>Coiling instability in the kitchen</title>

Abstract: Manipulation of viscous liquids is an essential kitchen activity - from pouring golden syrup onto a pancake to decorating a cake with whipped cream frosting, from streaming ketchup on top of French fries to dispensing molten chocolate onto a strawberry. Typical viscosities in these and many other kitchen flows, and the heights from which the streams are dispensed, make such jets susceptible to the coiling instability. Indeed, the coiling of a thin thread of poured maple syrup is a source of fascination for children and adults alike, whereas the folding of the stream of ketchup squeezed out from a plastic bottle is a phenomenon familiar to all. In this paper, we review the fluid dynamics of such kitchen flows and discuss separately the case when the substrate is stationary (honey on a toast), and when it translates (cookies on a conveyor belt) or rotates (a pancake on a spinning hot plate). It is hoped that this may encourage experimentation and enjoyment of physics in the kitchen, and perhaps even lead to more elegant if not more tasty culinary results.</description>

      <title>Collineations of particles in the Kob-Andersen system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous indications suggest that subtle changes occurring in the structures of liquids on supercooling are connected to the phenomenon of the glass transition and that detailed understanding of these changes is crucial for the development of new glasses with desired properties. J.D. Bernal in his 1962 Bakerian lecture, in particular, reported about an observation of approximately linear chains of several particles, referred to as collineations. He found that in the studied hard sphere system, these collineations can contain up to eight particles. Since then, the collineations of three particles have been discussed in many papers in the context of the splitting of the second peak in pair density functions of supercooled liquids and glasses. However, it appears that longer collineations involving more that three particles have not been systematically studied. Here, we report on our study of such collineations for the Kob-Andersen system of particles on cooling for the parent and inherent structures. Contrary to intuition, our findings reveal that below the potential energy landscape crossover temperature, the number of collineations in the parent structures can exceed that of the corresponding inherent structures. We also introduce a model that connects long collineations with the pair density and angular density distribution functions and demonstrate that this model describes long collineations quite well. The second part of the paper explores potential connections between collineations and: 1) the disclination lines associated with the geometric frustration approach, 2) low-energy clusters from the topological cluster classification approach, 3) chain-like cooperative motion of particles in low-temperature supercooled liquids. For the studied system, according to the used methods, no clear connection was found between collineations and these phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and protein configurations from molecular dynamics simulations with the nonlinear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara. Our primary focus in this work is to characterize the dynamic state of a system by quantifying prediction quality from data. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality $E$ and forecasting time $T_p$, the two basic parameters of the method, give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. We detect changes in protein dynamics due to mutations and, regarding ecology data, we show how cycles and {\it rhythms} of the environment manifests in parameter space $(E,T_p)$ for some species.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dipolar Activity: Quadrupolar Stress Drives Collapse of Nematic Order on Frictional Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of active nematics has traditionally employed descriptions based on dipolar activity, with interactions that align along a single axis. However, it has been theoretically predicted that interactions with a substrate, prevalent in most biological systems, would require novel forms of activity, such as quadrupolar activity, that are governed by hydrodynamic screening. Here, by combining experiments and numerical simulations, we show that upon light-induced solidification of the underlying medium, microtubule-kinesin mixtures undergo a transformation that leads to a biphasic active suspension. Using an active lyotropic model, we prove that the transition is governed by screening effects that alter the dominant form of active stress. Specifically, the combined effect of friction and quadrupolar activity leads to a hierarchical folding that follows the intrinsic bend instability of the active nematic layer. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of the collapse of orientational order in active nematics and present a new route for controlling active matter by modifying the activity through changing the surrounding environment.</description>

Abstract: Everyday experience shows that cellular sheets are stiffened by the presence of a pressurized gas: from bicycle inner tubes to bubble wrap, the presence of an internal pressure increases the stiffness of otherwise floppy structures. The same is true of plants, with turgor pressure (due to the presence of water) taking the place of gas pressure; indeed, in the absence of water, many plants wilt. However, the mechanical basis of this stiffening is somewhat opaque: simple attempts to rationalize it suggest that the stiffness should be independent of the pressure, at odds with everyday experience. Here, we study the mechanics of sheets that are a single cell thick and show how a pressure-dependent bending stiffness may arise. Our model rationalizes observations of turgor-driven shrinkage in plant cells and also suggests that turgor is unlikely to provide significant structural support in many monolayer leaves, such as those found in mosses. However, for such systems, turgor does provide a way to control leaf shape, in accordance with observations of curling upon drying of moss leaves. Guided by our results, we also present a biomimetic actuator that un-curls upon pressurization.</description>

      <title>Cell-level modelling of homeostasis in confined epithelial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15896</link>

Abstract: Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.</description>

      <title>Active Brownian particle under stochastic position and orientation resetting in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) subject to both position and orientation stochastic resetting in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. Utilizing a Fokker-Planck-based renewal approach, we derive the system's exact moments, including the mean parallel displacement, mean squared displacement (MSD), and the fourth-order moment of displacement, and compare these with numerical simulations. To capture deviations from Gaussian behavior, we analyze the excess kurtosis, which reveals rich dynamical crossovers over time. These transitions span from Gaussian behavior (zero excess kurtosis) to two distinct non-Gaussian regimes: an activity-dominated regime (negative excess kurtosis) and a resetting-dominated regime (positive excess kurtosis). Furthermore, we quantify the steady-state phase diagrams by varying three key control parameters: activity, resetting rate, and harmonic trap strength, using steady-state excess kurtosis as the primary metric.</description>
