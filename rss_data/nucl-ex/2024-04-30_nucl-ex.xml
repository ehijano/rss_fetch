      <title>Photoproduction of the {\Sigma}+ hyperon using linearly polarized photons with CLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Measurements of the polarization observables {\Sigma}, P, T, Ox, Oz for the reaction {\gamma}p {\rightarrow) KS0 {\Sigma}+ using a linearly polarized photon beam of energy 1.1 to 2.1 GeV are reported. Purpose: The measured data provide information on a channel that has not been studied extensively, but is required for a full coupled-channel analysis in the nucleon resonance region. Method: Observables have been simultaneously extracted using likelihood sampling with a Markov-Chain Monte- Carlo process. Results: Angular distributions in bins of photon energy E{\gamma} are produced for each polarization observable. T, Ox and Oz are first time measurements of these observables in this reaction. The extraction of {\Sigma} extends the energy range beyond a previous measurement. The measurement of P, the recoil polarization, is consistent with previous measurements. Conclusions: The measured data are shown to be significant enough to affect the estimation of the nucleon resonance parameters when fitted within a coupled-channels model.</description>

      <title>Axion Searches Go Deep Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the time modulation of radioisotope decays deep underground as a method to explore axion dark matter. In this work, we focus on the $\alpha$-decay of heavy isotopes and develop a theoretical description for the $\theta$-dependence of $\alpha$-decay half-lives, which enables us to predict the time variation of $\alpha$-radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. To probe this scenario, we have recently constructed and installed a setup deep underground at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the $\alpha$-decay of Americium-241. This prototype experiment, named RadioAxion-$\alpha$, will allow us to explore a broad range of oscillation's periods, from a few micro-seconds up to one year, thus providing competitive limits on the axion decay constant across 13 orders of magnitude in the axion mass, ranging from $10^{-9}$ eV to $10^{-20}$ eV after one month of data collection, and down to $10^{-22}$ eV after three years.</description>

      <title>CP Violation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and the subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. The verification of CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review.</description>

      <title>Does the Electron EDM Preclude Electroweak Baryogenesis ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) constitutes a theoretically compelling and experimentally testable mechanism for explaining the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). New results for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron place significant constraints on the beyond Standard Model CP-violation needed for successful EWBG. We show how new developments in EWBG quantum transport theory that include CP-violating sources first order in gradients imply more relaxed EDM constraints than implied by previous approximation formulations. Consequently, EWBG remains viable even in light of present EDM bounds. We also illustrate how these developments enable a more realistic treatment of CP-conserving interactions that can also have a decisive impact on the predicted BAU.</description>

      <title>Dihadron helicity correlation in photon-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helicity correlation of two back-to-back hadrons is a powerful tool that makes it possible to probe the longitudinal spin transfer, $G_{1L}$, in unpolarized hadronic collisions. In this work, we investigate the helicity correlation of back-to-back dihadrons produced in photon-nucleus collisions with both space-like and quasireal photons and explore its potential in understanding the flavor dependence of spin-dependent fragmentation functions. We present helicity amplitudes of partonic scatterings with both virtual and real photons and make numerical predictions for the dihadron helicity correlations at the future Electron Ion Collider experiment and the current RHIC/LHC ultra-peripheral collision experiment. Future experimental measurements can also illuminate the fragmentation function of circularly polarized gluons.</description>

      <title>Recent Neutrino Parameters Impact on the Effective Majorana Neutrino Mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>

      <title>Results on Elastic Cross Sections in Proton-Proton Collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 510$ GeV with the STAR Detector at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results on an elastic cross section measurement in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV, obtained with the Roman Pot setup of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The elastic differential cross section is measured in the four-momentum transfer squared range $0.23 \leq -t \leq 0.67$~GeV$^2$. We find that a constant slope $B$ does not fit the data in the aforementioned $t$ range, and we obtain a much better fit using a second-order polynomial for $B(t)$. The $t$ dependence of $B$ is determined using six subintervals of $t$ in the STAR measured $t$ range, and is in good agreement with the phenomenological models. The measured elastic differential cross section $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{dt}$ agrees well with the results obtained at $\sqrt{s} = 546$~GeV for proton--antiproton collisions by the UA4 experiment. We also determine that the integrated elastic cross section within the STAR $t$-range is $\sigma^\mathrm{fid}_\mathrm{el} = 462.1 \pm 0.9 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 1.1 (\mathrm {syst.}) \pm 11.6 (\mathrm {scale})$~$\mu\mathrm{b}$.</description>

      <title>Extracting transition generalized parton distributions from hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the extraction of transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from production of two back-to-back high transverse momentum photons ($\gamma\gamma$) and a massive pair of leptons ($\ell^+\ell^-$) in hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering. We argue that the exclusive scattering amplitude of both processes could be factorized into nonperturbative pion distribution amplitude and nucleon transition GPDs that are convoluted with perturbatively calculable short-distance matching coefficients. We demonstrate that the exclusive diphoton production not only is complementary to the Drell-Yan-type dilepton production for extracting the GPDs, but also provides enhanced sensitivities for extracting the parton momentum fraction $x$ dependence of the GPDs. We show that both exclusive observables are physically measurable at the J-PARC and AMBER experiment energies. If the target nucleon can be polarized, corresponding spin asymmetries can offer additional sensitivities for extracting transition GPDs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and non-relativistic energy-density functionals, for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>
