      <title>A second-order particle Fokker-Planck-Master method for diatomic gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is widely used to describe rarefied gas flows. The DSMC method accounts for the transport and collisions of computational particles, resulting in higher computational costs in the continuum regime. The Fokker-Planck (FP) model approximates particle collisions as Brownian motion to reduce computational cost. Advanced FP models have been developed to enhance physical fidelity, ensuring the correct Prandtl number and the H-theorem. The FP model has further been extended to handle diatomic gases, such as the Fokker-Planck-Master (FPM) model. Alongside these developments in modeling, computational efficiency has also been improved by achieving second-order spatial and temporal accuracy, as demonstrated in the unified stochastic particle FP (USP-FP) method. However, these accuracy improvements have not yet been extended to diatomic gases, which are essential for engineering applications such as atmospheric reentry. This study proposes a unified stochastic particle Fokker-Planck-Master (USP-FPM) method for diatomic gases that achieves second-order accuracy in both time and space. Temporal accuracy is enhanced by reproducing second-order energy, viscous stress, and heat flux relaxations. Spatial accuracy is improved by employing a first-order polynomial reconstruction method. Three test cases are investigated: homogeneous relaxation, Poiseuille flow, and hypersonic flow around a cylinder. The results show that the USP-FPM method provides accurate solutions even with coarser cell sizes and larger time steps compared to the DSMC and FPM methods. In particular, for the hypersonic flow around a cylinder, the USP-FPM method achieves a speed-up factor of 28 compared to the DSMC method, while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Physics-Machine Learning Models for Quantitative Electron Diffraction Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity electron microscopy simulations required for quantitative crystal structure refinements face a fundamental challenge: while physical interactions are well-described theoretically, real-world experimental effects are challenging to model analytically. To address this gap, we present a novel hybrid physics-machine learning framework that integrates differentiable physical simulations with neural networks. By leveraging automatic differentiation throughout the simulation pipeline, our method enables gradient-based joint optimization of physical parameters and neural network components representing experimental variables, offering superior scalability compared to traditional second-order methods. We demonstrate this framework through application to three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D-ED) structure refinement, where our approach learns complex thickness distributions directly from diffraction data rather than relying on simplified geometric models. This method achieves state-of-the-art refinement performance across synthetic and experimental datasets, recovering atomic positions, thermal displacements, and thickness profiles with high fidelity. The modular architecture proposed can naturally be extended to accommodate additional physical phenomena and extended to other electron microscopy techniques. This establishes differentiable hybrid modeling as a powerful new paradigm for quantitative electron microscopy, where experimental complexities have historically limited analysis.</description>

      <title>Advancing Material Modeling in Hydrocodes Beyond Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale simulation framework that couples the Finite Element Method with molecular dynamics. Bypassing traditional equations of state (EOS) by using in-line atomistic simulations, the method offers the advantage of incorporating detailed microscale physics not easily represented with coarse-grained models. Coupling consistency with the continuum code is ensured through the use of lifting and restriction operators, in line with heterogeneous multiscale methods. The concurrent continuum-atomistic framework is validated through comparison with experimental results and conventional EOS models, and demonstrated in a shock-driven hydrodynamic flow simulation under extreme conditions. We further evaluate the framework's usability by comparing it to state-of-the-art EOS models of deuterium. A computational performance study reveals that the atomistic EOS evaluation is a feasible alternative to conventional approaches, and demonstrates a weak scaling of 99% efficiency. These results highlight the framework's potential for large-scale multiscale modeling across a broad range of materials and conditions.</description>

      <title>Real-time physics-informed reconstruction of transient fields using sensor guidance and higher-order time differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes FTI-PBSM (Fixed-Time-Increment Physics-informed neural network-Based Surrogate Model), a novel physics-informed surrogate modeling framework designed for real-time reconstruction of transient responses in time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using only sparse, time-dependent sensor measurements. Unlike conventional Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-based models that rely on Automatic Differentiation (AD) over both spatial and temporal domains and require dedicated causal network architectures to impose temporal causality, the proposed approach entirely removes AD in the time direction. Instead, it leverages higher-order numerical differentiation methods, such as the Central Difference, Adams-Bashforth, and Backward Differentiation Formula, to explicitly impose temporal causality. This leads to a simplified model architecture with improved training stability, computational efficiency, and extrapolation capability. Furthermore, FTI-PBSM is trained on sparse sensor measurements from multiple PDE cases generated by varying PDE coefficients, with the sensor data serving as model input. This enables the model to learn a parametric PDE family and generalize to unseen physical cases, accurately reconstructing full-field transient solutions in real time. The proposed model is validated on four representative PDE problems-the convection equation, diffusion-reaction dynamics, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, and Allen-Cahn equation-and demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared to a causal PBSM, which is used as the baseline model, in both interpolation and extrapolation tasks. It also shows strong robustness to sensor noise and variations in training data size, while significantly reducing training time.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Mineral-water reactions in Earth's mantle: Predictions from Born theory and ab initio molecular dynamics" by Fowler et al. 2024 (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 372, 111-123)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This comment addresses discrepancies in dielectric constant calculations of water under extreme conditions (~10 GPa and 1000 K) between Fowler et al.'s recent study [Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 372, 111-123 (2024)] and the earlier work by Pan et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 110, 6646-6650 (2013)]. Through reproduced ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using the CP2K code with extended duration and identical system size, we rigorously validate that Pan et al.'s original results (39.4) are well-converged, contrasting with Fowler et al.'s reported value of 51. The observed discrepancy cannot be attributed to simulation duration limitations, but rather to methodological differences in dipole moment calculation. Our analysis highlights critical issues in the treatment of dipole moment fluctuations in periodic systems within the framework of modern theory of polarization. This clarification has significant implications for modeling mineral-water interactions in Earth's mantle using Born theory.</description>

      <title>Fast, Convex and Conditioned Network for Multi-Fidelity Vectors and Stiff Univariate Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning, especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude, achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Machine Learning of Interatomic Potentials for Elastic Property Modeling in Al-Mg-Zr Solid Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of resilient and lightweight Aluminum alloys is central to advancing structural materials for energy-efficient engineering applications. To address this challenge, in this study, we explore the elastic properties of Al-Mg-Zr solid solutions by integrating advanced machine learning (ML) techniques with quantum-mechanical (QM) atomistic simulations. For this purpose, we develop accurate and transferable machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) using two complementary approaches: (i) an on-the-fly learning scheme combined with Bayesian linear regression during ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and (ii) the equivariant neural network architecture MACE. Both MLIPs facilitate the prediction of composition-dependent elastic properties while drastically reducing the computational cost compared to conventional QM methods. Comparison with ultrasonic measurements shows that the deviation between simulation and experiment remains within a few GPa across all Al-Mg-Zr systems investigated. These potentials also enable the systematic exploration of the Al-Mg-Zr solid solution phase space and provide insights into the elastic behavior as a function of alloying element concentration. Hence, our findings demonstrate the reliability and transferability of the parameterized on-the-fly MLIPs, making them valuable for accelerating the design of Al alloys with tailored physicomechanical properties in complex compositional spaces. While the present study focuses on homogeneous phases, it establishes a foundation for future multiscale simulations that include microstructural features such as precipitates and grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Characteristics of a Glide-Symmetric Square Patch Metamaterial with Giant Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dispersion characteristics of a highly anisotropic metamaterial comprised of metal square patches arranged in a glide symmetry pattern and submerged in vacuum. Theoretical formulas are proposed to describe the electromagnetic tensors of a corresponding uniaxial effective medium with dielectric and magnetic responses. In addition, this work employs theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to examine the interaction between the metamaterial and electromagnetic waves across a broad spectral range. Band diagrams and isofrequency contours show good agreement between theoretical and numerical results for low frequencies and certain directions of propagation at higher frequencies. The ease of designing the metamaterial structure for various applications is facilitated by the derived theoretical formulas, which enable accurate prediction of the electromagnetic response across a wide range of frequencies based on geometric parameters.</description>

      <title>Phase-field model of alloy solidification far from chemical equilibrium at the solid-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [Ji et al., PRL 2023]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. Furthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</description>
