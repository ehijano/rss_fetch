      <title>Towards Practical Single-shot Motion Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01136v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advances in the so-called "cold start" generation from text prompts, their needs in data and computing resources, as well as the ambiguities around intellectual property and privacy concerns pose certain counterarguments for their utility. An interesting and relatively unexplored alternative has been the introduction of unconditional synthesis from a single sample, which has led to interesting generative applications. In this paper we focus on single-shot motion generation and more specifically on accelerating the training time of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In particular, we tackle the challenge of GAN's equilibrium collapse when using mini-batch training by carefully annealing the weights of the loss functions that prevent mode collapse. Additionally, we perform statistical analysis in the generator and discriminator models to identify correlations between training stages and enable transfer learning. Our improved GAN achieves competitive quality and diversity on the Mixamo benchmark when compared to the original GAN architecture and a single-shot diffusion model, while being up to x6.8 faster in training time from the former and x1.75 from the latter. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our improved GAN to mix and compose motion with a single forward pass. Project page available at https://moverseai.github.io/single-shot.</description>

      <title>3D-HGS: 3D Half-Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic 3D Reconstruction is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. This domain has seen considerable advancements owing to the advent of recent neural rendering techniques. These techniques predominantly aim to focus on learning volumetric representations of 3D scenes and refining these representations via loss functions derived from rendering. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a significant method, surpassing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). 3D-GS uses parameterized 3D Gaussians for modeling both spatial locations and color information, combined with a tile-based fast rendering technique. Despite its superior rendering performance and speed, the use of 3D Gaussian kernels has inherent limitations in accurately representing discontinuous functions, notably at edges and corners for shape discontinuities, and across varying textures for color discontinuities. To address this problem, we propose to employ 3D Half-Gaussian (3D-HGS) kernels, which can be used as a plug-and-play kernel. Our experiments demonstrate their capability to improve the performance of current 3D-GS related methods and achieve state-of-the-art rendering performance on various datasets without compromising rendering speed.</description>

      <title>Geometric Localization of Homology Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing an optimal cycle in a given homology class, also referred to as the homology localization problem, is known to be an NP-hard problem in general. Furthermore, there is currently no known optimality criterion that localizes classes geometrically and admits a stability property under the setting of persistent homology. We present a geometric optimization of the cycles that is computable in polynomial time and is stable in an approximate sense. Tailoring our search criterion to different settings, we obtain various optimization problems like optimal homologous cycle, minimum homology basis, and minimum persistent homology basis. In practice, the (trivial) exact algorithm is computationally expensive despite having a worst case polynomial runtime. Therefore, we design approximation algorithms for the above problems and study their performance experimentally. These algorithms have reasonable runtimes for moderate sized datasets and the cycles computed by these algorithms are consistently of high quality as demonstrated via experiments on multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>CoFie: Learning Compact Neural Surface Representations with Coordinate Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces CoFie, a novel local geometry-aware neural surface representation. CoFie is motivated by the theoretical analysis of local SDFs with quadratic approximation. We find that local shapes are highly compressive in an aligned coordinate frame defined by the normal and tangent directions of local shapes. Accordingly, we introduce Coordinate Field, which is a composition of coordinate frames of all local shapes. The Coordinate Field is optimizable and is used to transform the local shapes from the world coordinate frame to the aligned shape coordinate frame. It largely reduces the complexity of local shapes and benefits the learning of MLP-based implicit representations. Moreover, we introduce quadratic layers into the MLP to enhance expressiveness concerning local shape geometry. CoFie is a generalizable surface representation. It is trained on a curated set of 3D shapes and works on novel shape instances during testing. When using the same amount of parameters with prior works, CoFie reduces the shape error by 48% and 56% on novel instances of both training and unseen shape categories. Moreover, CoFie demonstrates comparable performance to prior works when using only 70% fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Key-Locked Rank One Editing for Text-to-Image Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image models (T2I) offer a new level of flexibility by allowing users to guide the creative process through natural language. However, personalizing these models to align with user-provided visual concepts remains a challenging problem. The task of T2I personalization poses multiple hard challenges, such as maintaining high visual fidelity while allowing creative control, combining multiple personalized concepts in a single image, and keeping a small model size. We present Perfusion, a T2I personalization method that addresses these challenges using dynamic rank-1 updates to the underlying T2I model. Perfusion avoids overfitting by introducing a new mechanism that "locks" new concepts' cross-attention Keys to their superordinate category. Additionally, we develop a gated rank-1 approach that enables us to control the influence of a learned concept during inference time and to combine multiple concepts. This allows runtime-efficient balancing of visual-fidelity and textual-alignment with a single 100KB trained model, which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the current state of the art. Moreover, it can span different operating points across the Pareto front without additional training. Finally, we show that Perfusion outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Importantly, key-locking leads to novel results compared to traditional approaches, allowing to portray personalized object interactions in unprecedented ways, even in one-shot settings.</description>

      <title>The Chosen One: Consistent Characters in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generation models have unlocked vast potential for visual creativity. However, the users that use these models struggle with the generation of consistent characters, a crucial aspect for numerous real-world applications such as story visualization, game development, asset design, advertising, and more. Current methods typically rely on multiple pre-existing images of the target character or involve labor-intensive manual processes. In this work, we propose a fully automated solution for consistent character generation, with the sole input being a text prompt. We introduce an iterative procedure that, at each stage, identifies a coherent set of images sharing a similar identity and extracts a more consistent identity from this set. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that our method strikes a better balance between prompt alignment and identity consistency compared to the baseline methods, and these findings are reinforced by a user study. To conclude, we showcase several practical applications of our approach.</description>

      <title>Extreme Compression of Adaptive Neural Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Neural Fields are a novel paradigm for signal representation, from images and audio to 3D scenes and videos. The fundamental idea is to represent a signal as a continuous and differentiable neural network. This idea offers unprecedented benefits such as continuous resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new compression techniques. However, representing data as neural networks poses new challenges. For instance, given a 2D image as a neural network, how can we further compress such a neural image?. In this work, we present a novel analysis on compressing neural fields, with the focus on images. We also introduce Adaptive Neural Images (ANI), an efficient neural representation that enables adaptation to different inference or transmission requirements. Our proposed method allows to reduce the bits-per-pixel (bpp) of the neural image by 4x, without losing sensitive details or harming fidelity. We achieve this thanks to our successful implementation of 4-bit neural representations. Our work offers a new framework for developing compressed neural fields.</description>
