      <title>Orthogonal Howe duality and dynamical (split) symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Etingof--Varchenko's dynamical fusion, dynamical $R$-matrix, and dynamical Weyl group for Lie algebras, we introduce, for split symmetric pairs, versions of dynamical fusion, dynamical $K$-matrix, and dynamical Weyl group. We then turn to the study of $(\mathfrak{so}_{2n},O_m)$-duality and prove that the standard Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov and dynamical operators (both differential and difference) on the $\mathfrak{so}_{2n}$-side are exchanged with the symmetric pair analogs, for $O_m\subset GL_m$, on the $O_m$-side.</description>

      <title>Nakajima's quiver varieties and triangular bases of bipartite cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berenstein and Zelevinsky introduced quantum cluster algebras \cite{BZ1} and the triangular bases \cite{BZ2}. The support conjecture proposed in \cite{LLRZ}, which asserts that the support of each triangular basis element for a rank-2 cluster algebra is bounded by an explicitly described region, was established in \cite{L} for skew-symmetric rank-2 cluster algebras. In this paper we extend this result by proving a bound on the support of each triangular basis element for bipartite cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Centers of Universal Enveloping Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g} )$ of a current (super)algebra or loop (super)algebra $\mathfrak{g} $ is considered over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K} $ with characteristic $p\ge 0$. This paper focuses on the structure of the center $Z(\mathfrak{g} )$ of $U(\mathfrak{g} )$. In the case of zero characteristic, $Z(\mathfrak{g} )$ is generated by the centers of $\mathfrak{g} $. In the case of prime characteristic, $Z(\mathfrak{g} )$ is generated by the centers of $\mathfrak{g} $ and the $p$-centers of $U(\mathfrak{g} )$. We also study the structure of $Z(\mathfrak{g} )$ in the semisimple Lie (super)algebra.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous spaces of semidirect products and finite Gelfand pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K\leq H$ be two finite groups and let $C\leq A$ be two finite abelian groups, with $H$ acting on $A$ as a group of isomorphisms admitting $C$ as a $K$-invariant subgroup. We study the homogeneous space $X\coloneqq\left(H\ltimes A\right)/\left(K\ltimes C\right)$ and determine the decomposition of the permutation representation of $H\ltimes A$ acting on $X$. We then characterize when this is multiplicity-free, that is, when $\left(H\ltimes A,K\ltimes C\right)$ is a Gelfand pair. If this is the case, we explicitly calculate the corresponding spherical functions. From our general construction and related analysis, we recover Dunkl's results on the $q$-analog of the nonbinary Johnson scheme.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Letourmy and Vendramin, a representation of a skew brace is a pair of representations on the same vector space, one for the additive group and the other for the multiplicative group, that satisfies a certain compatibility condition. Following their definition, we shall develop the theory of representations of skew braces. We show that the analogs of Maschke's theorem and Clifford's theorem hold for skew braces. We also study irreducible representations in prime characteristic.</description>

      <title>Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$, random partitions, and topological expansion of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Gaussian measure with parameter $q\in(0,1)$ on the dual of the unitary group of size $N$: we prove that a random highest weight under this measure is the coupling of two independent $q$-uniform random partitions $\alpha,\beta$ and a random highest weight of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. We prove deviation inequalities for the $q$-uniform measure, and use them to show that the coupling of random partitions under the Gaussian measure vanishes in the limit $N\to\infty$. We also prove that the partition function of this measure admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N$, and that this expansion is topological, in the sense that its coefficients are related to the enumeration of ramified coverings of elliptic curves. It provides a rigorous proof of the gauge/string duality for the Yang-Mills theory on a 2D torus with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N),$ advocated by Gross and Taylor \cite{GT,GT2}.</description>

      <title>On the regular representation of solvable Lie groups with open coadjoint quasi-orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a Lie theoretic intrinsic characterization of the connected and simply connected solvable Lie groups whose regular representation is a factor representation. When this is the case, the corresponding von Neumann algebras are isomorphic to the hyperfinite II$_\infty$ factor, and every Casimir function is constant. We thus obtain a family of geometric models for the standard representation of that factor. Finally, we show that the regular representation of any connected and simply connected solvable Lie group with open coadjoint orbits is always of type I, though the group needs not be of type I, and include some relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Matsumoto theorem for skeleta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof of a generalization of the theorem of H.~Matsumoto on Coxeter groups. Our generalized version is applicable to "graphs admitting geometric realization". The original version of the theorem for Coxeter groups is a special case when applied to the Cayley graph and the geometric representation of a Coxeter group. Our version of Matsumoto theorem is also applicable to skeleta, graphs that were defined in the recent paper by the authors on root Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the character tables of the groups $E_6(q)_{\text{ad}}$ and ${^2\!E}_6(q)_{\text{ad}}$ can be constructed, where $q$ is a power of~$2$. (Partial results are also obtained for any $q$ not divisible by~$3$.) This is based on previous work by Hetz, Lusztig, Malle, Mizuno and Shoji, plus computations using Michel's version of {\sf CHEVIE}. We also need some general results that are specific to semisimple groups which are not of simply connected type. A further crucial ingredient is the determination of the values of the unipotent characters on unipotent elements for groups of type $D_4$ and $D_5$ (in characteristic~$2$).</description>

      <title>The lowest discriminant ideal of central extensions of Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous joint paper with Wu and Yakimov, we gave an explicit description of the lowest discriminant ideal in a Cayley-Hamilton Hopf algebra (H,C,tr) of degree d over an algebraically closed field k, char k $\notin[1, d]$ with basic identity fiber, i.e. all irreducible representations over the kernel of the counit of the central Hopf subalgebra C are one-dimensional. Using results developed in that paper, we compute relevant quantities associated with irreducible representations to explicitly describe the zero set of the lowest discriminant ideal in the group algebra of a central extension of the product of two arbitrary finitely generated Abelian groups by any finite Abelian group under some conditions. Over a fixed maximal ideal of C the representations are tensor products of representations each corresponding to a central extension of a subgroup isomorphic to the product of two cyclic groups of the same order. A description of the orbit of the identity, i.e. the kernel of the counit of C, under winding automorphisms is also given.</description>

      <title>Archimedean Zeta Integrals for Unitary Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.04302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive precise formulas for the archimedean Euler factors occurring in certain standard Langlands $L$-functions for unitary groups. In the 1980s, Paul Garrett, as well as Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro and Stephen Rallis (independently of Garrett), discovered integral representations of automorphic $L$-functions that are Eulerian but, in contrast to the Rankin--Selberg and Langlands--Shahidi methods, do not require that the automorphic representations to which the $L$-functions are associated are globally generic. Their approach, the doubling method, opened the door to a variety of applications that could not be handled by prior methods.
  For over three decades, though, the integrals occurring in the Euler factors at archimedean places for unitary groups eluded precise computation, except under particular simplifications (such as requiring certain representations to be one-dimensional, as Garrett did in the first major progress on this computation and only prior progress for general signatures). We compute these integrals for holomorphic discrete series of general vector weights for unitary groups of any signature. This has consequences not only for special values of $L$-functions in the archimedean setting, but also for $p$-adic $L$-functions, where the corresponding term had remained open.</description>

      <title>The Module Structure of a Group Action on a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03379v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a finite group $G$ acting on a graded Noetherian $k$-algebra $S$, for some field $k$ of characteristic $p$; for example $S$ might be a polynomial ring. Regard $S$ as a $kG$-module and consider the multiplicity of a particular indecomposable module as a summand in each degree. We show how this can be described in terms of homological algebra and how it is linked to the geometry of the group action on the spectrum of $S$.</description>
