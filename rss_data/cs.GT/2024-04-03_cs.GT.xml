      <title>Shill-Proof Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a single-item auction, a duplicitous seller may masquerade as one or more bidders in order to manipulate the clearing price. This paper characterizes auction formats that are shill-proof: a profit-maximizing seller has no incentive to submit any shill bids. We distinguish between strong shill-proofness, in which a seller with full knowledge of bidders' valuations can never profit from shilling, and weak shill-proofness, which requires only that the expected equilibrium profit from shilling is nonpositive. The Dutch auction (with suitable reserve) is the unique optimal and strongly shill-proof auction. Moreover, the Dutch auction (with no reserve) is the unique prior-independent auction that is both efficient and weakly shill-proof. While there are a multiplicity of strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof, and optimal auctions; any optimal auction can satisfy only two properties in the set {static, strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof}.</description>

      <title>Symmetric mechanisms for two-sided matching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the basic one-to-one two-sided matching model, where there are two disjoint sets of agents of equal size, and each agent in a set has preferences on the agents in the other set, modelled by linear orders. The goal is to find a matching that associates each agent in one set with one and only one agent in the other set based on the agents' preferences. A mechanism is a rule that associates a set of matchings to each preference profile. Stability, which refers to the capability to select only stable matchings, is an important property a mechanism should fulfill. Another crucial property, especially useful for applications, is resoluteness, which requires that the mechanism always selects a unique matching. The two versions of the deferred acceptance algorithm are examples of stable and resolute mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are severely unfair since they strongly favor one of the two sides of the market. In this paper, we introduce a property that mechanisms may meet which relates to fairness. Such property, called symmetry, is formulated in a way able to capture different levels of fairness within and across the two sets of agents and generalize existing notions. We prove several possibility and impossibility results, mainly involving the most general notion of symmetry, known as gender fairness: among others, a resolute and gender fair mechanism exists if and only if each side of the market consists of an odd number of agents; there exists no resolute, stable and gender fair mechanism.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>

      <title>Cash or Non-Cash? Unveiling Ideators' Incentive Preferences in Crowdsourcing Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though research has repeatedly shown that non-cash incentives can be effective, cash incentives are the de facto standard in crowdsourcing contests. In this multi-study research, we quantify ideators' preferences for non-cash incentives and investigate how allowing ideators to self-select their preferred incentive -- offering ideators a choice between cash and non-cash incentives -- affects their creative performance. We further explore whether the market context of the organization hosting the contest -- social (non-profit) or monetary (for-profit) -- moderates incentive preferences and their effectiveness. We find that individuals exhibit heterogeneous incentive preferences and often prefer non-cash incentives, even in for-profit contexts. Offering ideators a choice of incentives can enhance creative performance. Market context moderates the effect of incentives, such that ideators who receive non-cash incentives in for-profit contexts tend to exert less effort. We show that heterogeneity of ideators' preferences (and the ability to satisfy diverse preferences with suitably diverse incentive options) is a critical boundary condition to realizing benefits from offering ideators a choice of incentives. We provide managers with guidance to design effective incentives by improving incentive-preference fit for ideators.</description>

      <title>Priority-Neutral Matching Lattices Are Not Distributive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable matchings are a cornerstone of market design, with numerous practical deployments backed by a rich, theoretically-tractable structure. However, in school-choice problems, stable matchings are not Pareto optimal for the students. Priority-neutral matchings, introduced by Reny (AER, 2022), generalizes the set of stable matchings by allowing for certain priority violations, and there is always a Pareto optimal priority-neutral matching. Moreover, like stable matchings, the set of priority-neutral matchings forms a lattice.
  We study the structure of the priority-neutral lattice. Unfortunately, we show that much of the simplicity of the stable matching lattice does not hold for the priority-neutral lattice. In particular, we show that the priority-neutral lattice need not be distributive. Moreover, we show that the greatest lower bound of two matchings in the priority-neutral lattice need not be their student-by-student minimum, answering an open question. This show that many widely-used properties of stable matchings fail for priority-neutral matchings; in particular, the set of priority-neutral matchings cannot be represented by via a partial ordering on a set of rotations. However, by proving a novel structural property of the set of priority-neutral matchings, we also show that not every lattice arises as a priority-neutral lattice, which suggests that the exact nature of the family of priority-neutral lattices may be subtle.</description>

      <title>An Abundance of Katherines: The Game Theory of Baby Naming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the highly competitive arena of baby naming. Through making several Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (namely, that parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents who pick a name based solely on its uniquness), we create a model which is not only tractable and clean, but also perfectly captures the real world. We then extend our investigation with numerical experiments, as well as analysis of large language model tools. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Deviator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A group of players are supposed to follow a prescribed profile of strategies. If they follow this profile, they will reach a given target. We show that if the target is not reached because some player deviates, then an outside observer can identify the deviator. We also construct identification methods in two nontrivial cases.</description>
