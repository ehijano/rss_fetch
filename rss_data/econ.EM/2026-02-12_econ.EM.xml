      <title>Inference for High-Dimensional Local Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper rigorously analyzes the properties of the local projection (LP) methodology within a high-dimensional (HD) framework, with a central focus on achieving robust long-horizon inference. We integrate a general dependence structure into h-step ahead forecasting models via a flexible specification of the residual terms. Additionally, we study the corresponding HD covariance matrix estimation, explicitly addressing the complexity arising from the long-horizon setting. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to substantiate the derived theoretical findings. In the empirical study, we utilize the proposed HD LP framework to study the impact of business news attention on U.S. industry-level stock volatility.</description>

      <title>Quantile optimization in semidiscrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport is the problem of designing a joint distribution for two random variables with fixed marginals. In virtually the entire literature on this topic, the objective is to minimize expected cost. This paper is the first to study a variant in which the goal is to minimize a quantile of the cost, rather than the mean. For the semidiscrete setting, where one distribution is continuous and the other is discrete, we derive a complete characterization of the optimal transport plan and develop simulation-based methods to efficiently compute it. One particularly novel aspect of our approach is the efficient computation of a tie-breaking rule that preserves marginal distributions. In the context of geographical partitioning problems, the optimal plan is shown to produce a novel geometric structure.</description>

      <title>Fact or friction: Jumps at ultra high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that jumps in financial asset prices are often erroneously identified and are, in fact, rare events accounting for a very small proportion of the total price variation. We apply new econometric techniques to a comprehensive set of ultra high-frequency equity and foreign exchange tick data recorded at millisecond precision, allowing us to examine the price evolution at the individual order level. We show that in both theory and practice, traditional measures of jump variation based on lower-frequency data tend to spuriously assign a burst of volatility to the jump component. As a result, the true price variation coming from jumps is overstated. Our estimates based on tick data suggest that the jump variation is an order of magnitude smaller than typical estimates found in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Detecting Network Instability via Multiscale Detrended Cross-Correlations and MST Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multiscale measure of network instability based on the joint use of Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) filtering. The proposed metric, the Elastic Detrended Cross-Correlation Ratio (Elastic DCCR), is defined as a finite-difference measure of the logarithmic sensitivity of the average MST length to the observation scale. It captures how the structure of cross-correlation networks deforms across different investment horizons. When applied to a network of global equity indices, the Elastic DCCR rises sharply during episodes of financial stress, reflecting increased short-term coordination among investors and a contraction of correlation distances. The measure reveals scale-dependent reconfigurations in network topology that are not visible in single-scale analyses, and highlights clear differences between stressed and stable market regimes. The approach does not assume covariance stationarity and relies only on scale-dependent detrended correlations; as a result, it is broadly applicable to other complex systems in which interaction strength varies with scale.</description>

      <title>Integrating granular data into a multilayer network: an interbank model of the euro area for systemic risk assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-structural models of contagion and systemic risk emphasize that shock propagation is inherently multi-channel, spanning counterparty exposures, short-term funding and roll-over risk, securities cross-holdings, and common-asset (fire-sale) spillovers. Empirical implementations, however, often rely on stylized or simulated networks, or focus on a single exposure dimension, reflecting the practical difficulty of reconciling heterogeneous granular collections into a coherent representation with consistent identifiers and consolidation rules. We close part of this gap by constructing an empirically grounded multilayer network for euro area significant banking groups that integrates several supervisory and statistical datasets into layer-consistent exposure matrices defined on a common node set. Each layer corresponds to a distinct transmission channel, long- and short-term credit, securities cross-holdings, short-term secured funding, and overlapping external portfolios, and nodes are enriched with balance-sheet information to support model calibration. We document pronounced cross-layer heterogeneity in connectivity and centrality, and show that an aggregated (flattened) representation can mask economically relevant structure and misidentify the institutions that are systemically important in specific markets. We then illustrate how the resulting network disciplines standard systemic-risk analytics by implementing a centrality-based propagation measure and a micro-structural agent-based framework on real exposures. The approach provides a data-grounded basis for layer-aware systemic-risk assessment and stress testing across multiple dimensions of the banking network.</description>

      <title>Distributional Instruments: Identification and Estimation with Quantile Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study instrumental-variable designs where policy reforms strongly shift the distribution of an endogenous variable but only weakly move its mean. We formalize this by introducing distributional relevance: instruments may be purely distributional. Within a triangular model, distributional relevance suffices for nonparametric identification of average structural effects via a control function. We then propose Quantile Least Squares (Q-LS), which aggregates conditional quantiles of X given Z into an optimal mean-square predictor and uses this projection as an instrument in a linear IV estimator. We establish consistency, asymptotic normality, and the validity of standard 2SLS variance formulas, and we discuss regularization across quantiles. Monte Carlo designs show that Q-LS delivers well-centered estimates and near-correct size when mean-based 2SLS suffers from weak instruments. In Health and Retirement Study data, Q-LS exploits Medicare Part D-induced distributional shifts in out-of-pocket risk to sharpen estimates of its effects on depression.</description>

      <title>Improving Robust Decisions with Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16281v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decision-maker faces uncertainty governed by a data-generating process (DGP), which is only known to belong to a set of sequences of independent but possibly non-identical distributions. A robust decision maximizes the expected payoff against the worst possible DGP in this set. This paper characterizes when and how such robust decisions can be \emph{objectively} improved with data -- that is, yield higher expected payoffs under the true DGP regardless of which DGP is the truth. It further develops simple and novel inference procedures that achieve such improvement, while common methods (e.g., maximum likelihood) may fail to do so.</description>

      <title>Modewise Additive Factor Model for Matrix Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Modewise Additive Factor Model (MAFM) for matrix-valued time series that captures row-specific and column-specific latent effects through an additive structure, offering greater flexibility than multiplicative frameworks such as Tucker and CP factor models. In MAFM, each observation decomposes into a row-factor component, a column-factor component, and noise, allowing distinct sources of variation along different modes to be modeled separately. We develop a computationally efficient two-stage estimation procedure: Modewise Inner-product Eigendecomposition (MINE) for initialization, followed by Complement-Projected Alternating Subspace Estimation (COMPAS) for iterative refinement. The key methodological innovation is that orthogonal complement projections completely eliminate cross-modal interference when estimating each loading space. We establish convergence rates for the estimated factor loading matrices under proper conditions. We further derive asymptotic distributions for the loading matrix estimators and develop consistent covariance estimators, yielding a data-driven inference framework that enables confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. As a technical contribution of independent interest, we establish matrix Bernstein inequalities for quadratic forms of dependent matrix time series. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches.</description>
