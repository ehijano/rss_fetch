      <title>Constraining high-energy neutrinos from tidal disruption events with IceCube high-energy starting events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\rm jet} \gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Dynamo Action in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are expected to generate intense magnetic fields that power relativistic and non-relativistic outflows and shape their multimessenger signatures. These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Early results in the search for extreme coronal line emitters with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present the results of our search through the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) - a rare classification of galaxies displaying strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines within their spectra. With the requirement of a strong X-ray continuum to generate the coronal emission, ECLEs have been linked to both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We focus our search on identifying TDE-linked ECLEs. We identify three such objects within the EDR sample, highlighting DESI's effectiveness for discovering new nuclear transients, and determine a galaxy-normalized TDE-linked ECLE rate of $R_\mathrm{G}=5~^{+5}_{-3}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at a median redshift of z = 0.2 - broadly consistent with previous works. Additionally, we also identify more than 200 AGNs displaying coronal emission lines, which serve as the primary astrophysical contaminants in searches for TDE-related events. We also include an outline of the custom python code developed for this search.</description>

      <title>Proposal to Search for the CP Violating Electromagnetic Vacuum Angle at the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32\pi^2}\theta_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.</description>

      <title>Towards precision astrometry of scattered images of compact radio sources: scintillometry theory and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact radio sources such as pulsars and FRBs undergo scintillation in the interstellar medium (ISM) when scattered images interfere at the observer. ``Scintillometry'' refers to the range of techniques to extract astrometric information -- such as the angular positions of the images and distances to the scattering screen and source -- from scintillation observations. Pulsar scintillometry has proven to be a powerful technique, revealing rich and unexpected scattering phenomenology in the ISM and also shedding light on the emission physics of pulsars. FRB scintillometry stands to be a similarly powerful probe of FRB emission, as well as structure on tiny scales in ionized media beyond our galaxy, such as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). However, nascent FRB scintillation studies are far from the sophisticated lensing geometry reconstructions that have been performed for scintillating pulsars. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for scintillometry, demonstrating that the full astrometric content of scintillation observations is contained within a single underlying observable: the instantaneous spatial wavefield. We relate the instantaneous spatial wavefield to more familiar concepts from the pulsar scintillometry literature, such as the dynamic spectrum. Using this framework, we discuss prospects and limitations for FRB scintillometry, towards the goal of full astrometric reconstructions of FRB lensing geometries. We show how key degeneracies in two-screen scattering measurements can be ameliorated. In addition, we discuss the possibility of inferring dispersion measure gradients across scintillation screens, which may shed light on the highly unconstrained physics of the cool CGM phase on tiny ($\sim 100\,{\rm au}$) scales.</description>

      <title>NOCTURNE. I. The radio spectrum of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the radio emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated. Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Generation of Neutron Star Equations of State Using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning model based on a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to reconstruct and generate neutron star (NS) equations of state (EOS). The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\%)$ for $(M_{\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.</description>

      <title>TeV Gamma-Rays from the Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4278: Implications for the Diffuse Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the origin of the TeV emission detected by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) from NGC 4278, a galaxy hosting a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN). Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\rm L,0}(\Delta T_{\rm TeV}/T) \sim 10^{-5}~\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.</description>

      <title>Compton hump reverberation lag in the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A with NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reverberation delay measurements have moved beyond the 10 keV X-ray range, providing evidence for the Compton hump (a.k.a. reflection hump) in the lag spectra. We report the relativistic reverberation of the reflection hump in the bright Seyfert\,1 galaxy IC\,4329A based on a long {\it NuSTAR} observation. We find a delayed response of the 20--30 keV X-ray band, with a lag time of $\sim1825$ s at frequencies $0.5-1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $\sim195$ s as the frequencies increase to $(1.5-10)\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Including IC\,4329A, so far five sources have been explored for reflection hump reverberation. We perform reverberation modelling of the 3--50 keV lag-energy spectra using the general relativistic transfer function code, which provides independent timing-based measurements of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}=1.37_{-0.36}^{+0.33}\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and the coronal height $h=2.45_{-2.36}^{+1.92}~R_{\rm g}$ (with uncertainties at 90\% confidence). Within the uncertainties, the measured mass is found to be consistent with the previous finding. Furthermore, we undertake reflection spectroscopy to account for the hump feature and the associated relativistic effect using the time-averaged flux spectrum. Further sampling of the {\it NuSTAR} data (with a bin width of 0.2/0.4 keV below and above 10 keV) that reshapes the spectral resolution allows us to constrain the coronal temperature at $50.26_{-4.03}^{+5.58}$ keV -- consistent with the previous result from the combined {\it Suzaku} and {\it NuSTAR} data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the emission signatures of pulsar halo candidate HESS J1813-126</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended gamma-ray sources surrounding middle-aged pulsars, primarily observed at teraelectronvolt energies, have been interpreted as pulsar halos, where relativistic $e^\pm$ diffuse into the interstellar medium and produce inverse-Compton (IC) emission. HESS J1813-126, associated with the energetic, radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1246, has been suggested as a candidate pulsar halo, though its nature remains uncertain. We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246. We explain the X-ray and gamma-ray SEDs of the pulsar using the SC framework. We further computed the transport and losses of $e^\pm$ injected by the pulsar through time-dependent diffusion-loss equations, exploring various common pulsar halo transport models. The resulting IC emission was compared with \textit{Fermi}-LAT, H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO data. We present predictions for the surface brightness profiles (SBPs) and the aperture-dependent emission for the different transport models, providing key diagnostics for assessing the observability of HESS J1813-126 with current and future instruments. The SC framework successfully reproduces the emission of PSR J1813-1246. The SED of HESS J1813-126 can be consistently reproduced within different pulsar halo frameworks, albeit with distinct predictions across different transport models. The corresponding SBP predictions and aperture-dependent emission offer testable signatures for future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, which will be crucial for discriminating between the transport models. We further examined the link between the pulsar central engine and its extended halo by comparing the pair multiplicities in the magnetospheric and halo regions.</description>

      <title>Pulse-resolved Classification and Characteristics of Long-duration GRBs with \emph{Swift}-BAT Data.I. Precursors versus Main Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic pulse-by-pulse analysis of 22 long-duration GRBs observed by \emph{Swift}, each exhibiting a well-separated precursor before the main burst. We compare duration, spectral hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag between these components. Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows. Despite temporal differences, both episodes are consistent with a single collapsar origin, providing no evidence for dual-progenitor events. Our findings support pulse-resolved classification and show that precursors offer critical insights into jet formation and pre-burst activity.</description>

      <title>Late-time X-ray afterglows of GRBs: Implications for particle acceleration at relativistic shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations are currently among the most advanced tools to investigate particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $\epsilon_{\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</description>

Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the extreme brightness of the fast radio burst FRB 20250316A, a luminous, apparently non-repeating event detected by CHIME/FRB. Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\sim$ 600 years ($1\sigma$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fr\'echet type ($\xi &gt; 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fr\'echet-type distribution with a $\sim50$-year return period in $1\sigma$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($\xi &lt; 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys. Our results underscore the existence of rare, highly luminous events that may probe the upper limits or distinct sub-populations of the FRB luminosity distribution.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Variability of the Broad H$\beta$ Emission Line in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of broad H$\beta$ variability properties for all spectra of quasars with $z&lt;0.8$ and at least two observations included in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 quasar catalog. For each spectrum, we perform a spectral decomposition to isolate the broad H$\beta$ emission. We measure the luminosity, FWHM, equivalent width, centroid, and Pearson skewness coefficient of broad H$\beta$ and provide derived physical properties such as the single-epoch black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity. For each pair of spectra in the sample, we calculate the change in radial velocity of the centroid of broad H$\beta$ emission ($\Delta v_{rad}$) as well as other derived properties related to broad H$\beta$ shape variability. We use forward-modeling methods to estimate the uncertainty in our measurements and discuss an improved method for estimating the uncertainty in $\Delta v_{rad}$ in the case where a spectral decomposition is used to isolate the broad H$\beta$ emission. We find that $\Delta v_{rad}$ is not normally distributed and that the shape of the distribution depends on the interval between observations. We discuss the effect of the predominance of the Reverberation Mapping subsample in the sample of pairs of spectra in SDSS.</description>

      <title>Constraining Black Hole Parameters from Shadow and Inner-Shadow Morphology Considering Effects from Thick Disk Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of emission geometry on the capability to constrain black hole parameters from measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We investigate the capability to constrain mass, charge, observer inclination, and emission co-latitude from images of black hole accretion flows that would arise from thick and thin accretion disks. We confirm previous studies that have shown that independent radii measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow can constrain black hole parameters if the viewing inclination is known, but find that it is only possible if the true emission geometry is also assumed. We study the constraining capabilities of the shadow and inner-shadow observations of M87* and Sgr A* like systems within the context of the BHEX and NgEHT future observatories.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dot $-$ Host Galaxy $=$ Black Hole Star: A Gas-Enshrouded Heart at the Center of Every Little Red Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008\r{A} line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $&gt;2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta&gt;10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm{\star}}$~$10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008\r{A}~$1100$\r{A}, CIII]~$12$\r{A}), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500\r{A}) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$, lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.</description>

      <title>How supermassive black holes shape central entropies in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of galaxy clusters show central cooling times of less than 1 Gyr and associated central cluster entropies below $30\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$. We provide a straight forward explanation for these low central entropies in cool core systems and how this is related to accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Assuming a time-averaged equilibrium between active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet heating of the radiatively cooling intracluster medium (ICM) as well as Bondi accretion, we derive an equilibrium entropy that scales with the SMBH and cluster mass as $K\propto M_\bullet^{4/3}M_{500\mathrm{c}}^{-1}$. At fixed cluster mass, overly massive SMBHs would raise the central entropy above the cool core threshold, thus implying a novel way of limiting SMBH masses in cool core clusters. We find a limiting mass of $1.4\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in a cool core cluster of mass $10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We carry out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster with AGN jets and find that they reproduce the predictions of our analytic model, once corrections for elevated jet entropies are applied in calculating X-ray emissivity-weighted cluster entropies. Our findings have significant implications for modelling galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations: a combination of overmassive SMBHs and high heating efficiencies preclude the formation of cool core clusters.</description>

      <title>Anomalous narrow line Seyfert I galaxies from SDSS DR17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 22,656 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 ($0.1\leq z\leq 0.9$), identifying a sample of spectroscopically anomalous sources. These anomalies were detected via the spectroscopic quasar anomaly detection (SQuAD) algorithm, which employed principal component analysis and hierarchical k-means clustering. Various physical diagnostic analysis were performed such as the color excess ($E_{(B-V)}$) calculations, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color analysis, probing O III, equivalent width as an inclination indicator, the BPT diagram and eigenvector 1 diagram. We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\lambda3345$, Ne V $\lambda3426$, Ne III $\lambda3869$ etc). We conclude that the differentiating factor between red and blue NLSy1s is not dust obscuration or orientation effect, but intrinsic distinction in AGN activity. The resulting sample is presented as a value-added catalog.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a compact hierarchical triple main-sequence star system while searching for binary stars with compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discovered a compact hierarchical triple main-sequence star system, which is cataloged as Gaia DR3 1010268155897156864 or TIC 21502513. Hereafter, we call it ``G1010''. G1010 consists of a primary (the most massive) star and inner binary that orbit each other. The primary star is a $0.85_{-0.03}^{+0.03}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star, and the inner binary components are $0.63_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ and $0.61_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ MS stars. The outer and inner orbital periods are $277.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ and $\sim 18.26$ days, respectively. G1010 is categorized as a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and its orbital solution indicates that G1010 possibly accompanies a massive compact object, such as a neutron star or massive white dwarf. In order to confirm the presence of a massive compact object, we have performed several-times low signal-to-ratio (SNR) and one-time high SNR spectroscopic observations, and determined the outer orbital parameters. Moreover, we have deeply analyzed the high SNR spectroscopic data, and found that G1010 accompanies not a massive compact object, but an inner binary. We have investigated G1010's light curve in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and concluded that the inner binary is actually an eclipsing binary, not included in TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. We have obtained the inner orbital parameters from the TESS light curve. G1010 is similar to compact hierarchical triple star systems previously discovered by eclipse timing variation analysis. Our discovery has shown that such triple star systems can be discovered by combination of low- and high-SNR spectroscopic observations with the help of Gaia DR3 and the upcoming Gaia DR4/DR5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions are exceedingly rare, with only a handful of examples known. Using a Kerr-Schild ansatz, we derive a multitude of exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions within a broad class of Generalized Proca theories. These black holes differ significantly from Kerr black holes, as they possess primary hair and are non-circular, thus breaking a symmetry that vacuum black holes exhibit in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating galaxies and cosmic dispersion measures: Constraints on the gas-to-halo mass relation from 2MASS galaxies and 133 localized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a cross-correlation analysis between large-scale structures traced by the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy catalog and the cosmic dispersion measures of 133 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs). The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 &lt; R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] &lt; 1$. Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \sim 0.01\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ should be below $\sim 10\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging rapid parameter estimates for efficient gravitational-wave Bayesian inference via posterior repartitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy typically relies on rigorous, computationally expensive Bayesian analyses. Several methods have been developed to perform rapid Bayesian inference, but they are not yet used to inform our full analyses. We present a novel approach for doing this whilst ensuring that the Bayesian prior remains independent of the data, providing a statistically rigorous way to leverage low-latency information to accelerate the final inference. By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\times$ for binaries with SNRs $&lt; 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that dark matter halos can support regular black holes or compact stars by assuming an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the dark matter halo as an isotropic perfect fluid. By employing galactic dark matter profiles-specifically the Einasto and Dehnen models-as the mass-energy density source, we numerically solve the Einstein field equations and find a class of non-singular, horizonless compact star solutions. Moreover, these configurations remain stable against axial perturbations while satisfying the dominant energy condition.</description>

Abstract: We apply analytical models to study the property of neutron stars and dark stars. With the aim of exploring the global observable properties of those compact stars, we investigate the total masses and radii, the tidal deformabilities and especially the fundamental (f -) mode oscillations. While we choose two typical models in this work, this method applies to any analytical equations of state. By comparing with the multi-messenger observations, one can constrain the corresponding parameters in those models.</description>

      <title>Optimal cross-correlation technique to search for strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates.</description>

      <title>A neutrino flare candidate potentially associated with X-ray emission from tidal disruption event ATLAS17jrp</title>

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), in which stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes, have been proposed as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos through hadronic interactions. X-ray-bright TDEs provide dense photon fields conducive to neutrino production via proton-photon ($p\gamma$) processes. We conducted a time-dependent unbinned likelihood analysis of ten years (2008-2018) of IceCube muon-track data, focusing on ten TDEs with confirmed X-ray detections during this period. We report a neutrino flare candidate spatially and temporally coincident with the TDE ATLAS17jrp, occurring 19 days after the onset of its X-ray activity and lasting for 56 days, with a post-trial $p$-value of 0.01. This significance is modest, representing a hint of an association. We illustrate the neutrino emission using a simple lepton-hadronic model, where X-ray photons serve as target fields. While this model can account for the neutrino data around 100 TeV, the low-energy neutrinos may imply contributions from an additional component. Although constrained by the sample size of X-ray-detected TDEs, these results underscore the need for high-cadence X-ray monitoring and future neutrino observatories to further explore the connection between TDEs and high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of observable inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</description>

      <title>Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries</title>

Abstract: Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Deep Search for Joint Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of LIGO and Virgo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (&gt; $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of perturbation theory for neutrino decoherence in power-law correlated turbulent matter, establishing rigorous convergence criteria and providing detailed numerical validation. Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \propto t^{-\nu}e^{-t/\tau_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\xi$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\cos 2\theta_m \approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\xi &lt; \xi_c \approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\xi = 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\sim 1\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\nu \geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.</description>

Abstract: Taking advantage of the most recent measurements by means of high-resolution radio observations and other multiwavelength campaigns, it is possible to elaborate a detailed map of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy 1H 0323+342. This map will open the possibility of intriguing hypotheses about the generation of high-energy gamma rays in the narrow-line region.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations as a Probe of Macrorealism</title>

Abstract: The correlations between successive measurements of a quantum system can violate a family of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGIs) that are analogous to the violation of Bell's inequalities of measurements performed on spatially separated quantum systems. These LGIs follow from a macrorealistic point of view, imposing that a classical system is at all times in a definite state and that a measurement can, at least in principle, leave this state undisturbed. Violations of LGIs can be probed by neutrino flavour oscillations if the correlators of consecutive flavour measurements are approximately stationary. We discuss here several improvements of the methodology used in previous analyses based on accelerator and reactor neutrino data. We argue that the strong claims of LGI violations made in previous studies are based on an unsuitable modelling of macrorealistic systems in statistical hypothesis tests. We illustrate our improved methodology via the example of the MINOS muon-neutrino survival data, where we find revised statistical evidence for violations of LGIs at the $(2-3)\sigma$ level, depending on macrorealistic background models.</description>

      <title>Linear analysis of I-C-Love universal relations for neutron stars</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are excellent laboratories for testing gravity theories as they are strongly self-gravitating bodies and have rich observational phenomena. However, strong-field gravity effects in NS could be degenerate with their equation of state (EOS) which is largely unknown. Fortunately, there exist the so-called universal relations among the NS macroscopic quantities that are found to be insensitive to the underlying EOS. Studying the origin of these relations can lead to a better understanding of NSs and the gravitational interaction. We develop a new perspective of view to analyze the I-C and I-Love universal relations for NSs. At the linear order, we separate the deviation of the universal relations into two factors that are multiplied together. One is the EOS difference while the other factor only depends on the background star structure. The smallness of the second factor that does not depend on the EOS difference then indicates the origin of the universality. We discuss the validity of our linear approximation when considering the difference among realistic EOSs. Our study can be regarded as a new frame for quantitative representation of the universality and may provide new insights to the universal relations of NSs.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the dynamical dark energy with evolving Hubble constant</title>

Abstract: Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. We investigate the possible redshift evolution of dark energy and the Hubble constant through a data-driven approach, and assess whether such evolution can alleviate the Hubble constant tension. We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. The analysis combines the DESI DR2 BAO dataset with multiple Type Ia supernova samples and evaluates the statistical preference for the reconstructed model using Bayesian evidence. The reconstructed $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. The results remain stable under different prior choices and dataset combinations. Our data-driven reconstructions suggest redshift evolution in both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$, offering a potential route to mitigate the Hubble constant tension. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>A persistent bow shock in a diskless magnetised accreting white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</description>
