      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Generalizable and Label-Free Inference of Temperature-Dependent Thermoelectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), such as thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, is essential for reliable modeling and efficient design of thermoelectric devices. However, their nonlinear temperature dependence and coupled transport behavior make both forward simulation and inverse identification difficult, particularly under sparse measurement conditions. In this study, we develop a physics-informed machine learning approach that employs physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving forward and inverse problems in thermoelectric systems, and neural operators (PINO) to enable generalization across diverse material systems. The PINN enables field reconstruction and material property inference by embedding governing transport equations into the loss function, while the PINO generalizes this inference capability across diverse materials without retraining. Trained on simulated data for 20 p-type materials and evaluated on 60 unseen materials, the PINO model demonstrates accurate and label-free inference of TEPs using only sparse field data. The proposed framework offers a scalable, generalizable, and data-efficient approach for thermoelectric property identification, paving the way for high-throughput screening and inverse design of advanced thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Domain Switching on the Pareto Front: Multi-Objective Deep Kernel Learning in Automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning, but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex, non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Defect complexes in CrSBr revealed through electron microscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic defects underpin the properties of van der Waals materials, and their understanding is essential for advancing quantum and energy technologies. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for defect identification in atomically thin materials, and extending it to multilayer and beam-sensitive materials would accelerate their exploration. Here we establish a comprehensive defect library in a bilayer of the magnetic quasi-1D semiconductor CrSBr by combining atomic-resolution imaging, deep learning, and ab-initio calculations. We apply a custom-developed machine learning work flow to detect, classify and average point vacancy defects. This classification enables us to uncover several distinct Cr interstitial defect complexes, combined Cr and Br vacancy defect complexes and lines of vacancy defects that extend over many unit cells. We show that their occurrence is in agreement with our computed structures and binding energy densities, reflecting the intriguing layer interlocked crystal structure of CrSBr. Our ab-initio calculations show that the interstitial defect complexes give rise to highly localized electronic states. These states are of particular interest due to the reduced electronic dimensionality and magnetic properties of CrSBr and are furthermore predicted to be optically active. Our results broaden the scope of defect studies in challenging materials and reveal new defect types in bilayer CrSBr that can be extrapolated to the bulk and to over 20 materials belonging to the same FeOCl structural family.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover otherwise undetectable amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Dimerization of Ag adatoms on Si(100) at surprisingly low temperature due to adatom migration on top of Si-dimer rows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The puzzling experimental observations of Ag addimer formation on the Si(100) surface upon vapor deposition at low temperature, even as low as 140 K, reported by Huang et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2021, 23, 4161], is explained by facile thermal migration on top of the Si dimer rows, while diffusion is inactive once an Ag adatom lands in one of the optimal binding sites in between dimer rows. The previously hypothesized transient mobility due to the hot spot formed as an Ag atom lands on the Si surface is found not to contribute significantly to mobility and dimer formation. The experimental conditions are simulated by a combination of classical dynamics calculations of the deposition events, systematic searches of saddle points representing transition states for thermally activated events and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of long timescale evolution of the system over a temperature range from 100 K to 300 K. While the calculated energy barriers for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the Si dimer rows are found to be nearly equal, indicating isotropic diffusion, the simulations show highly anisotropic diffusion, as the optimal migration mechanism involves multiple hops of Ag adatoms on top of Si dimer rows. Impinging Ag atoms are found to have a 90% chance of landing on top of a dimer row and while the hot spot created cools down too fast for transient mobility to play an important role, the energy barrier for thermally activated hops along the dimer row is low enough for migration to be active even at 100 K. A migrating Ag adatom can dimerise with another Ag adatom sitting at a stable binding site in between rows or another adatom on top of the same row. The simulations for deposition at 140 K show that most of the deposited Ag atoms end up forming dimers.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Rapid Crystal Structure Generation Towards a Target Local Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.</description>

      <title>A non-local exchange potential for electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we describe a model for the exchange interaction of electrons, as it follows from the Pauli exclusion principle. Starting from Hartree-Fock theory and making use of the free electron-gas model we propose a simple scheme to calculate the exchange-potential for atoms as well as simple molecules and solids. This method assures the correct asymptotic long-range behavior of the potential, contrary to local-density approximations that rely on a strongly simplified generalization of the well-known Kohn-Sham or Slater exchange interaction. Furthermore, our results approach the Kohn-Sham results in the interstitial space of solids. As a benchmark test, total energies and eigenenergies for atoms from He to Xe computed within our model are compared to other calculations as well as to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Developing a Neural Network Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of La-Si-P Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While molecular dynamics (MD) is a very useful computational method for atomistic simulations, modeling the interatomic interactions for reliable MD simulations of real materials has been a long-standing challenge. In 2007, Behler and Perrinello first proposed and demonstrated an artificial neural network machine learning (ANN-ML) scheme, opening a new paradigm for developing accurate and efficient interatomic potentials for reliable MD simulation studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of materials. In this paper, we show that an accurate and transferable ANN-ML interatomic potential can be developed for MD simulations of La-Si-P system. The crucial role of training data in the ML potential development is discussed. The developed ANN-ML potential accurately describes not only the energy versus volume curves for all the known elemental, binary, and ternary crystalline structures in La-Si-P system, but also the structures of La-Si-P liquids with various compositions. Using the developed ANN-ML potential, the melting temperatures of several crystalline phases in La-Si-P system are predicted by the coexistence of solid-liquid phases from MD simulations. While the ANN-ML model systematically underestimates the melting temperatures of these phases, the overall trend agrees with experiment. The developed ANN-ML potential is also applied to study the nucleation and growth of LaP as a function of different relative concentrations of Si and P in the La-Si-P liquid, and the obtained results are consistent with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Mic-hackathon 2024: Hackathon on Machine Learning for Electron and Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we propose a comprehensive first-principle atomistic approach to predict the Wulff-Kaischew equilibrium shape of crystals heterogeneously integrated on a dissimilar material. This method uses both reconstructed surface and interface absolute energies, as determined by density functional theory, to infer the morphology and wetting properties of Volmer-Weber islands over the whole range of accessible chemical potentials. The predicted equilibrium shapes of GaP crystals heterogeneously grown on Si, are found to be in good agreements with experimental observations performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Such method provides a tool for optimization of hetero-structured, multifunctional and smart materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic to mesoscale hierarchical structures and magnetic states in an anisotropic layered ferromagnet FePd2Te2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have predominantly exhibited easy-axis or easy-plane anisotropy and display a high sensitivity to the underlying crystal structure and lattice symmetry. Recently, an in-plane anisotropic 2D ferromagnet of FePd2Te2 has been discovered with intriguing structure and quasi-one-dimensional spin system. Here, we report a real-space investigation of its twinning structure and magnetic states using atomic/magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The atomic to mesoscale hierarchical structures with the orthogonal and corrugated compressive /tensile(C/T) regions are directly observed due to the intrinsic twinning-domain characteristic. The structure-related intact ferromagnetic (FM), field-induced polarized-FM states and their transitions are comparatively discussed at the mesoscale with the corresponding macroscopic magnetic measurements. Temperature- and field-dependent evolution of magnetic phase are further investigated at the FM and PM states, and summarized to obtain a unique H-T phase diagram of FePd2Te2. Our work provides key results for understanding the complicated magnetic properties of FePd2Te2, and suggests new directions for manipulating magnetic states through the atomic and mesoscale structure engineering.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen diffusion in ceria: solid state NMR, combined scattering and spectroscopic studies, and ab initio calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ceria has been extensively studied since it has many applications in diverse research fields. However, the mechanism of the hydrogen dynamics, especially the diffusion kinetics on a microscopic level is still unclear as the experimental data has been very limited. In this work, the CeO$_2$-H interaction has been comprehensively studied by a combination of $^1$H NMR transverse relaxation time ($T_2$) measurement, neutron powder diffraction, quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS), X-ray total scattering, and ab initio calculations. Based on QENS measurements, the first direct evidence for hydrogen jump diffusions of the Chudley-Elliot type in the bulk ceria has been given, with a jump distance of ~3.98 angstrom. The theoretically calculated activation energy barriers $E_a$ for hydrogen diffusion are relatively low (less than 0.1 eV), further supporting that such hopping can readily occur. A larger barrier value of $E_a$ ~0.2 eV is directly estimated by $T_2$ NMR data, suggesting possible slower hydrogen dynamics with the pre-exponential factor $D_0$ of diffusion coefficient ~10$^{-11}$ m$^2/$s.</description>

      <title>Imaging the indirect-to-direct band-gap crossover in PbI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the band-gap in PbI2 (i.e. direct or indirect) is crucial for its applications. Here we directly image, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, its thickness-dependent crossover from an indirect to a direct band-gap. We experimentally probe a large shift of the valence band maximum towards the center of the Brillouin zone, when the thickness of PbI2 films is greater than a monolayer. Our experimental results, accompanied by density functional theory calculations, suggest that the band-gap crossover is driven by interlayer interactions and the hybridization of iodine pz orbitals. These findings demonstrate the tunable electronic properties of PbI2, highlighting its potential for applications in optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Two-dimensional Electron Gases with Magnetic Doping and Proximity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of magnetic two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces has provided new opportunities in the field of spintronics. The enhancement of magnetism in 2DEGs at oxide interfaces continues to be a significant challenge, as exemplified by the relatively weak magnetism observed in the classical LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Here, we present ferromagnetic (FM) 2DEGs at the interface fabricated between the FM insulator EuTiO3 (ETO) and the strong spin-orbit coupled (SOC) perovskite insulator KTaO3 (KTO). With the combined effects of magnetic atom doping and magnetic proximity from ETO films, the coercive field of 2DEGs can be significantly enhanced. Magnetoresistance (MR) curve with a high coercive field of 1000 Oe has been observed, in conjunction with a temperature-dependent unambiguous hysteresis loop in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Furthermore, within the 2DEGs, we have identified a synergetic interplay between magnetic scattering and the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect on transport. This study provides fresh insights into the formation of FM 2DEGs at ETO/KTO interfaces, and introduce an innovative pathway for creating high-performance magnetic 2DEGs at oxide interfaces.</description>

      <title>Crystal Nucleation in Eutectic Al-Si Alloys by Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solidification control is crucial in manufacturing technologies, as it determines the microstructure and, consequently, the performance of the final product. Investigating the mechanisms occurring during the early stages of nucleation remains experimentally challenging as it initiates on nanometer length and sub-picoseconds time scales. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning interatomic potential with quantum accuracy appears the dedicated approach to complex, atomic level, multidimensional mechanisms with local symmetry breaking. A potential trained on a high-dimensional neural network on density functional theory-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories for liquid and undercooled states for Al-Si binary alloys enables us to study the nucleation mechanisms occurring at the early stages from the liquid phase near the eutectic composition. Our results indicate that nucleation starts with Al in hypoeutectic conditions and with Si in hypereutectic conditions. Whereas Al nuclei grow in a globular shape, Si ones grow with polygonal faceting, whose underlying mechanisms are further discussed.</description>

      <title>A multi-physics model for dislocation driven spontaneous grain nucleation and microstructure evolution in polycrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The granular microstructure of metals evolves significantly during thermomechanical processing through viscoplastic deformation and recrystallization. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries (GBs), subgrains, localized deformation bands, and non-uniform dislocation distributions critically influence grain nucleation and growth during recrystallization. Traditionally, modeling this coupled evolution involves separate, specialized frameworks for mechanical deformation and microstructural kinetics, typically used in a staggered manner. Nucleation is often introduced ad hoc, with nuclei seeded at predefined sites based on criteria like critical dislocation density, stress or strain. This is a consequence of the inherent limitations of the staggered approach, where newly formed GBs or grains have to be incorporated with additional processing. In this work, we propose a unified, thermodynamically consistent field theory that enables spontaneous nucleation driven by stored dislocations at GBs. The model integrates Cosserat crystal plasticity with the Henry-Mellenthin-Plapp orientation phase field approach, allowing the simulation of key microstructural defects, as well as curvature- and stored energy-driven grain boundary migration. The unified approach enables seamless identification of GBs that emerge from deformation and nucleation. Nucleation is activated through a coupling function that links dislocation-related free energy contributions to the phase field. Dislocation recovery occurs both at newly formed nuclei and behind migrating GBs. The model's capabilities are demonstrated using periodic bicrystal and polycrystal simulations, where mechanisms such as strain-induced boundary migration, subgrain growth, and coalescence are captured. The proposed spontaneous nucleation mechanism offers a novel addition to the capabilities of phase field models for recrystallization simulation.</description>

      <title>Precise control of the phase-transition temperature of VO2 from 70 to -35 {\deg}C for tunable optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the combination of metal doping and ion bombardment as a hybrid technique to precisely engineer the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) films. This approach enables (i) setting the phase-transition temperature ($T_c$) from $-35$ to $70$ {\deg}C, (ii) near-zero hysteresis in highly doped and irradiated films, and (iii) robust optical contrast across a broad range of doping and irradiation conditions, down to $T_c = -35$ {\deg}C. While previous work has focused on engineering the IMT via one of metal doping or ion irradiation, our hybrid method utilizes both. In doing so, we address several lingering challenges in VO$_2$ engineering, including the trade-off between $T_c$ reduction and optical contrast, and limitations in the achievable value of T$_c$. Strain$-T_c$ correlation from XRD and Raman measurements suggests a common mechanism behind doping- and irradiation-induced $T_c$ reduction. The ability to reduce the $T_c$ and hysteresis of VO$_2$ while maintaining large optical contrast will extend the functionality of VO$_2$-based optical and optoelectronic devices, including detectors, limiters, and modulators.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Orbital Hall Effect over Spin in Transition Metal Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inverse spin and orbital Hall effects in 19 transition metals using spin-pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance. Spin-to-charge conversion was measured in YIG/X(5), while orbital-to-charge conversion was probed in YIG/Pt(2)/X(5) heterostructures. Here, X represents the different transition metals. Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials. These findings emphasize the fundamental role of the orbital Hall effect, and position orbitronics as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic current uniformity in a (Ba,K)Fe2As2 bulk sample produced by a process that demonstrated high trapped magnetic fields was evaluated through a comparative experimental and modeling approach. The bulk sample, with a well-defined square geometry, exhibited ideal roof-top patterns in magneto-optical (MO) images. Comparison of the magnetic moment, MO images, and finite element modeling results showed good agreement for the critical current density, suggesting that the supercurrent circulates uniformly throughout the sample on the order of MO resolution. These results highlight the importance of enhancing flux pinning strength and microstructural control at the submicron and grain boundary scale in iron-based superconducting polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Nucleation kinetics in phase transformations with spatially correlated nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions ruled by nucleation and growth can occur by nonrandom arrangement of nuclei. This is verified, for instance, in thin film growth at solid surfaces by vapor condensation or by electrodeposition where, around each nucleus, a depletion zone of reactants sets up within which nucleation is prevented. In this contribution, a theoretical approach for the kinetics of phase transition with spatially correlated nuclei by progressive nucleation is developed. The work focuses on the rate of formation of the actual nuclei, a quantity that is necessary for describing the transformation kinetics. The approach is based on correlation functions and applied to treat hard-sphere interaction between nuclei. Computations have been performed for 2D and 3D growths by truncation of the series expansion in correlation functions up to second order terms. It is shown that the nucleation kinetics undergoes a transition from a typical Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) behavior to one that is like the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) kinetics. The time evolution of the volume fraction of the new phase is found to depend slightly on correlation radius. Such behavior is explained by the partial balancing between the reduction in nucleation density and the decrease in impingement events, which have opposite effects on the kinetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals have emerged as promising functional architectures due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, high surface areas, and versatile use in real-life applications such as sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. While the optical and morphological properties of nanoporous metals have been extensively studied, their electronic properties at ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the transient response of a nanoporous gold metamaterial and compare it with the ultrafast dynamics of a continuous gold film. We unravel that the nanoporous sample supports lower energy interband transitions, due to a much higher electron temperature in the nanoporous material, which causes an enhanced redistribution of electron density around the Fermi level. The experimental results are consistent with the two-temperature model, which highlights the role of nanoscale porosity in enabling the more efficient generation of hot carriers, thus allowing lower energy photons to induce interband transitions. Our findings demonstrate that nanoporosity affects fundamental ultrafast electronic processes and introduces this platform as temporal metamaterial allowing the emergence of tunable electronic properties not supported by the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we present new insights into ultrafast electronic properties of nanoporous metals, which can impact several areas, from photochemistry and catalysis to energy harvesting and opto-electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons (EPs) are part-light part-matter quasiparticles that combine large exciton-mediated nonlinearities with long-range coherence, ideal for energy harvesting and nonlinear optics. Optimizing EPs for these applications is predicated on a still-elusive understanding of how disorder affects their propagation and dephasing times. Here, using cutting-edge femtosecond spatiotemporal microscopy, we directly image EP propagation at light-like speeds in systems ranging from two-dimensional semiconductors to amorphous molecular films with systematically varied exciton-phonon coupling, exciton delocalization, and static disorder. Despite possessing similar EP dispersions, we observe dramatically different transport velocities and scattering times across systems. We establish a robust scaling law linking EP scattering to exciton transfer integral, demonstrating that polaritons based on materials with large exciton bandwidths are immune to disorder even for highly excitonic EPs. This observation cannot be deduced from the systems' linear optical properties, including EP dispersion and linewidth disorder. Our work highlights the critical and often-overlooked role of the matter component in dictating polariton properties, and provides precise guidelines for simultaneously optimizing EP propagation and nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Identifying vortex lattice in type-II superconductors via the dynamic magnetostrictive effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In type-I superconductors, zero electrical resistivity and perfect diamagnetism define two fundamental criteria for superconducting behavior. In contrast, type-II superconductors exhibit more complex mixed-state physics, where magnetic flux penetrates the material above the lower critical field Hc1 in the form of quantized vortices, each carrying a single flux quantum. These vortices form a two-dimensional lattice which persists up to another irreversible field (Hirr) and then melts into a dissipative liquid phase. The vortex lattice is fundamental to the magnetic and electrical properties of type-II superconductors, a third definitive criterion-beyond resistivity and magnetization-for identifying this phase has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a dynamic magnetostrictive effect, wherein the geometry of the superconductor oscillates only under an applied alternating magnetic field due to the disturbance of the vortex lattice. This effect is detected by a thin piezoelectric transducer, which converts the excited geometric deformation into an in-phase ac voltage. Notably, we find a direct and nearly linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the vortex density in lattice across several representative type-II superconductors. In the vortex liquid phase above Hirr, the signal amplitude rapidly decays to zero near the upper critical field (Hc2), accompanied by a pronounced out-of-phase component due to enhanced dissipation. This dynamic magnetostrictive effect not only reveals an unexplored magnetoelastic property of the vortex lattice but also establishes a fundamental criterion for identifying the type-II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of microphase separation in a swollen, strain-stiffening polymer network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic MicroPhase Separation (EMPS) provides a simple route to create soft materials with homogeneous microstructures by leveraging the supersaturation of crosslinked polymer networks with liquids. At low supersaturation, network elasticity stabilizes a uniform mixture, but beyond a critical threshold, metastable microphase-separated domains emerge. While previous theories have focused on describing qualitative features about the size and morphology of these domains, they do not make quantitative predictions about EMPS phase diagrams. In this work, we extend Flory-Huggins theory to quantitatively capture EMPS phase diagrams by incorporating strain-stiffening effects. This model requires no fitting parameters and relies solely on independently measured solubility parameters and large-deformation mechanical responses. Our results reveal that strain-stiffening enables metastable microphase separation within the swelling equilibrium state and why the microstructures can range from discrete droplets to bicontinuous networks. This works highlights the critical role of nonlinear elasticity in controlling phase-separated morphologies in polymer gels.</description>

ATAT can now handle multicomponent multisublattice alloy systems, nonconfigurational sources of entropy (e.g. vibrational and electronic entropy), Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) generation, tensorial cluster expansion construction and includes interfaces for multiple atomistic or ab initio codes. This paper presents an overview of these features geared towards the practical use of the code. The extensions to the cluster expansion formalism needed to cover multicomponent multisublattice alloys are also formally demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Theory for Tunnel Magnetoresistance Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal oscillation of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio as a function of the insulating barrier thickness in crystalline magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is a long-standing unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. To explain this, we here introduce a superposition of wave functions with opposite spins and different Fermi momenta, based on the fact that spin-flip scattering near the interface provides a hybridization between majority- and minority-spin states. In a typical Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ, we solve the tunneling problem and show that the TMR ratio oscillates with a period of $\sim3\,$\r{A} by varying the MgO thickness, consistent with previous and present experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in resonant photoelectron diffraction as a direct probe of sublattice magnetization in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials that are promising for spintronics technology. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, the circular dichroism (CD) in resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) contains a time-reversal odd signal, which provides a direct probe of the sublattice magnetization. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L2,3-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large magnetic CD is found for light helicity parallel to the N\'eel vector. This signal has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the X-ray magnetic CD in absorption of a single sublattice, thus providing a direct probe of the local magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>NEP89: Universal neuroevolution potential for inorganic and organic materials across 89 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near-quantum-mechanical accuracy for atomistic simulations, many are material-specific or computationally intensive, limiting their broader use. Here we introduce NEP89, a foundation model based on neuroevolution potential architecture, delivering empirical-potential-like speed and high accuracy across 89 elements. A compact yet comprehensive training dataset covering inorganic and organic materials was curated through descriptor-space subsampling and iterative refinement across multiple datasets. NEP89 achieves competitive accuracy compared to representative foundation models while being three to four orders of magnitude more computationally efficient, enabling previously impractical large-scale atomistic simulations of inorganic and organic systems. In addition to its out-of-the-box applicability to diverse scenarios, including million-atom-scale compression of compositionally complex alloys, ion diffusion in solid-state electrolytes and water, rocksalt dissolution, methane combustion, and protein-ligand dynamics, NEP89 also supports fine-tuning for rapid adaptation to user-specific applications, such as mechanical, thermal, structural, and spectral properties of two-dimensional materials, metallic glasses, and organic crystals.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Properties and Topological Polar Textures of PbTiO$_3$ from a Second-Principles Open-Source Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an open-source, fully atomistic second-principles interatomic potential for lead titanate (PbTiO3), a benchmark ferroelectric material known for its strong polarization and hightemperature phase transitions. While density functional theory excels at capturing atomic-scale behavior, it remains computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations required to explore complex phenomena. Our model addresses this limitation by accurately reproducing key properties of PbTiO3, including domain wall dynamics and different topological textures formation, which are known as key features to next-generation memory and energy-efficient technologies. Validated against DFT data, the model remains predictive across a wide range of conditions. It offers an accessible and efficient framework for high-accuracy large-scale simulations, allowing deeper insights into PbTiO3 and its potential applications.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall effect assisted field-free perpendicular magnetization switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through the conventional spin Hall effect (SHE) and/or Rashba-Edelstein effect offer potential for magnetization manipulation. However, deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets via SOTs requires a strong symmetry-breaking perturbation, typically an external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate that field-free SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization can be facilitated with the assistance of the orbital Hall effect (OHE). Using a representative Co/PtGd bilayer SOT device, we find that while the planar Hall effect (PHE) generates a finite out-of-plane damping-like torque, representing a lateral symmetry breaking, the SHE-induced torque achievable at practical current density is insufficient to switch the perpendicular magnetization. Incorporating a Mo underlayer and exploiting its strong OHE can amplify the in-plane damping-like torque via orbital-to-spin conversion, enabling efficient field-free deterministic switching without complex device geometries or low symmetric spin sources, providing a straightforward and scalable strategy for achieving high-speed and low-power spintronics.</description>

      <title>Little to lose: the case for a robust European green hydrogen strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EU targets 10 Mt of green hydrogen production by 2030, but has not committed to targets for 2040. Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and storage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we find that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in most considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to resolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.</description>

      <title>polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation</title>

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymers. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.</description>

      <title>Iterative Corpus Refinement for Materials Property Prediction Based on Scientific Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates, validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where reliable data are scarce or non-existent.</description>
