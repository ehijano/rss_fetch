      <title>Quasiorthogonality of Commutative Algebras, Complex Hadamard Matrices, and Mutually Unbiased Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deepen the theory of quasiorthogonal and approximately quasiorthogonal operator algebras through an analysis of the commutative algebra case. We give a new approach to calculate the measure of orthogonality between two such subalgebras of matrices, based on a matrix-theoretic notion we introduce that has a connection to complex Hadamard matrices. We also show how this new tool can yield significant information on the general non-commutative case. We finish by considering quasiorthogonality for the important subclass of commutative algebras that arise from mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) in quantum information theory. We present a number of examples throughout the work, including a subclass that arises from group algebras and Latin squares.</description>

      <title>Dual canonical bases of quantum groups and $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\imath$quantum groups have two realizations: one via the $\imath$Hall algebras and the other via the quantum Grothendieck rings of quiver varieties, as developed by the first author and Wang. Perverse sheaves provide the dual canonical bases for $\imath$quantum groups of type ADE with integral and positive structure constants. In this paper, we present a new construction of the dual canonical bases in the setting of $\imath$Hall algebras. We also introduce Fourier transforms for both $\imath$Hall algebras and quantum Grothendieck rings, and prove the invariance of the dual canonical bases under braid group actions and Fourier transforms. Additionally, we establish the positivity of the transition matrix coefficients from the Hall basis (and PBW basis) to the dual canonical basis. As quantum groups can be regarded as $\imath$quantum groups of diagonal type, we demonstrate that the dual canonical bases of Drinfeld double quantum groups coincide with the double canonical bases defined by Berenstein and Greenstein, resolving several conjectures therein.</description>

      <title>On dominant $\ell$--weights and maps between Weyl modules for quantum affine $A_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the set of dominant $\ell$--weights in the Weyl (or standard) modules for quantum affine $A_n$. We then prove that the space of homomorphisms between standard modules is at most one-dimensional and give a necessary and sufficient condition for equality to hold. We also describe the socle of the standard module and prove that the socle is simple for large $n$. Finally, we give applications of our results to mixed Weyl modules, calculating extensions in the category and identify new families of tensor subcategories of finite dimensional representations.</description>

      <title>Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for the cyclotomic Hecke algebra and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for irreducible characters of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra on certain standard elements, which fully determine their values. This work builds upon our recent multi-parameter Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Macdonald polynomials. Our Murnaghan-Nakayama rule can be readily specialized to retrieve various existing rules, including those for the complex reflection group of type $G(m, 1, n)$ and the Iwahori-Hecke algebra in types $A$ and $B$. In a dual picture, we establish an iterative formula for the irreducible characters on upper multipartitions, utilizing the vertex operator realization of Schur functions.
  As applications we derive an Regev-type formula and an L\"ubeck-Prasad-Adin-Roichman-type formula for the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, thereby extending the corresponding formulas for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra in type $A$ and the complex reflection group of type $G(m,1,n)$ to the setting of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, respectively. Finally, we introduce the notion of the multiple bitrace of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra to formulate the second orthogonal relation of the irreducible characters. We also provide a general combinatorial rule to compute the multiple bitrace.</description>

      <title>The Forbidden Quiver of a Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forbidden moves in virtual knot theory can be used to unknot any knot, virtual or classical; however, multi-component crossings in links can still survive. Using the forbidden moves, we obtain a quiver-valued invariant of classical and virtual links we call the forbidden quiver and use it to obtain two polynomial invariants of virtual and classical links, the forbidden polynomials. Since these invariants are not sensitive to single-component crossing change, they are also link homotopy invariants.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangianity of $p$-supports of holonomic D-modules and $q$-D-modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M. Kontsevich conjectured and T. Bitoun proved that if M is a nonzero holonomic D-module then the p-support of a generic reduction of M to characteristic p&gt;0 is Lagrangian. We provide a new elementary proof of this theorem and also generalize it to q-D-modules. The proofs are based on Bernstein's theorem that any holonomic D-module can be transformed by an element of the symplectic group into a vector bundle with a flat connection, and a q-analog of this theorem.</description>

      <title>Laplacians on $ q $-deformations of compact semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of formulating a correct notion of Laplacian on compact quantum groups (CQGs) has long been recognized as both fundamental and nontrivial. Existing constructions typically rely on selecting a specific first-order differential calculus (FODC), but the absence of a canonical choice in the noncommutative setting renders these approaches inherently non-canonical. In this work, we propose a simple set of conditions under which a linear operator on a CQG can be recognized as a Laplacian -- specifically, as the formal modulus square of the differential associated with a bicovariant FODC. A key feature of our framework is its generality: it applies to arbitrary finite-dimensional bicovariant $*$-FODCs on \( K_q \), the \( q \)-deformation of a compact semisimple Lie group \( K \). To each such calculus, we associate a Laplacian defined via the formal modulus square of its differential. Under mild additional assumptions, we demonstrate that these operators converge to classical Laplacians on \( K \) in the classical limit \( q \to 1 \), thereby justifying their interpretation as ``$q$-deformed Laplacians." Furthermore, we prove that the spectra of the $q$-deformed Laplacians are discrete, real, bounded from below, and diverge to infinity, much like those of their classical counterparts. However, in contrast to the classical case, the associated heat semigroups do not define quantum Markov semigroups.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories, demonstrating that under certain general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories--these posets are lattices. Building on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.
  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

Abstract: We study the super analogue of the Molev-Ragoucy reflection algebras, which we call twisted super Yangians of type AIII, and classify their finite-dimensional irreducible representations under certain conditions. These superalgebras are coideal subalgebras of the super Yangian $\mathscr{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$ and are associated with symmetric pairs of type AIII in Cartan's classification. We establish the Schur-Weyl type duality between degenerate affine Hecke algebras of type BC and twisted super Yangians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Koszul duality between differential graded categories and pointed curved coalgebras interchanges smooth and proper Calabi-Yau structures. This result is a generalization and conceptual explanation of the following two applications. For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the universal enveloping algebra is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the Chevalley-Eilenberg chain coalgebra, which exists if and only if Poincare duality is satisfied. For a topological space X having the homotopy type of a finite complex we show an oriented Poincare duality structure (with local coefficients) on X is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the dg coalgebra of chains on X and to a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the dg algebra of chains on the based loop space of X.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>SymTFT, Protected Gaplessness, and Spontaneous Breaking of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years we have learned that several four-dimensional field theories can manifest non-invertible zero-form symmetries generalizing the Kramers-Wannier duality defect of the 2d critical Ising model. Several recent works by various groups have observed a deep interplay among such non-invertible symmetries in 3+1 dimensions, their anomalies, and the properties of the ground state(s). The purpose of this work is to present a first coarse classification of all possible classes of non-invertible symmetries of this type that can either enforce gaplessness or be spontaneously broken in the infrared exploiting the topological symmetry theory formalism. Our methods also generalize to non-invertible KW-like duality symmetries graded by non-abelian finite subgroups. As a first applications of our results we present examples in the context of supersymmetric models. Along the way we notice the potential for further global structures that could be realized by non-SUSY versions of Argyres-Douglas type fixed points.</description>
