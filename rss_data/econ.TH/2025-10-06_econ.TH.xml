      <title>Optimal risk sharing, equilibria, and welfare with empirically realistic risk attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03328v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines optimal risk sharing for empirically realistic risk attitudes, providing results on Pareto optimality, competitive equilibria, utility frontiers, and the first and second theorems of welfare. Contrary to common theoretical assumptions, empirical studies find prevailing risk seeking in particular subdomains, in particular for losses. We first allow for some risk-seeking agents, still assuming expected utility. Yet more empirical realism is obtained by allowing agents to be neither risk averse nor risk seeking and by generalizing expected utility. Here we provide first results, pleading for future research. Our main new tool is a counter-monotonic improvement theorem.</description>

      <title>Non-Bayesian Learning in Misspecified Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deviations from Bayesian updating are traditionally categorized as biases, errors, or fallacies, thus implying their inherent ``sub-optimality.'' We offer a more nuanced view. We demonstrate that, in learning problems with misspecified models, non-Bayesian updating can outperform Bayesian updating.</description>

      <title>An Implementation Relaxation Approach to Principal-Agent Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic first-order approach (FOA) relaxes the principal-agent problem by replacing the incentive compatibility (IC) constraint with its first-order condition. We show that FOA is not a valid relaxation when the support of the outcome distribution shifts with the agent's effort, as in well-studied additive-noise models. In such cases, the optimal effort may occur at a kink point that the first-order condition cannot capture, causing FOA to miss optimal contracts, including the widely adopted bonus schemes. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the Implementation Relaxation Approach (IRA), which accommodates nondifferentiable optima and is straightforward to apply across settings. Rather than directly relaxing IC, IRA relaxes the set of implementable agent efforts and utilities, reducing the problem to identifying the effort-utility pair from which the optimal contract can be constructed. This inverse perspective is particularly convenient for analyzing simple contracts. Using IRA, we derive an optimality condition for quota-bonus contracts that is more general than FOA-based conditions, including those established in the literature under fixed-support assumptions. This also fills a gap where the optimality of quota-bonus contracts in shifting-support settings has been examined only under endogenous assumptions, and it highlights the broader applicability of IRA as a methodological tool.</description>

      <title>A Simple Characterization of Qualified Majority Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes every qualified majority voting rule with a quota $q$ strictly greater than half of the voter set in environments with just two alternatives through anonymity, responsiveness, and $q$-neutrality. Crucially, the latter imposes independence of the labels of the alternatives only for all preference profiles in which some alternative is strictly top-ranked by at least $q$ voters. Thus, this paper generalizes May's (1952, Theorem, p. 682) characterization of the simple majority voting rule to qualified majority voting rules with a quota $q$ strictly greater than half of the voter set. In doing so, it shows that these qualified majority voting rules are distinguished by their degree of neutrality.</description>

      <title>Explainable Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal signaling schemes in information design (Bayesian persuasion) problems often involve non-explainable randomization or disconnected partitions of state space, which are too intricate to be audited or communicated. We propose explainable information design in the context of information design with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use $K$-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE) -- the ratio between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and unrestricted signaling scheme -- is exactly $1/2$ in the worst case, meaning that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling schemes by a factor of 2.
  We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But for Lipschitz utility functions, an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find an explainable signaling scheme that provides a $1/2$ approximation to the optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.
  A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme (which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that achieves $1/2$ fraction of the expected utility of the former. We use this tool in the proofs of both our PoE result and algorithmic result.</description>
