      <title>Evolutionary Dispersal of Ecological Species via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding species dynamics in heterogeneous environments is essential for ecosystem studies. Traditional models assumed homogeneous habitats, but recent approaches include spatial and temporal variability, highlighting species migration. We adopt starvation-driven diffusion (SDD) models as nonlinear diffusion to describe species dispersal based on local resource conditions, showing advantages for species survival. However, accurate prediction remains challenging due to model simplifications. This study uses multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with deep Q-networks (DQN) to simulate single species and predator-prey interactions, incorporating SDD-type rewards. Our simulations reveal evolutionary dispersal strategies, providing insights into species dispersal mechanisms and validating traditional mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Natural selection at multiple scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural selection acts on traits at different scales, often with opposing consequences. This article identifies the particular forces that act at each scale and how those forces combine to determine the overall evolutionary outcome. A series of extended models derive from the tragedy of the commons, illustrating opposing forces at different scales. Examples include the primary tension between conflict and cooperation and the evolution of virulence, sex ratios, dispersal, and evolvability. The unified analysis subsumes interactions within and between species by generalizing multitrait interactions. Expanded notions of recombination and cotransmission arise. The core theoretical approach isolates the fundamental forces of selection, including marginal valuation, correlation between interacting entities, and reproductive value. Those fundamental forces act as partial causes that combine at different temporal and spatial scales. Modeling focuses on statics, in the sense of how different forces at various scales tend to oppose each other, ultimately combining to shape traits. That type of static analysis emphasizes explanation rather than the calculation of dynamics. The article builds on the duality between explanation versus calculation in terms of statics versus dynamics. The literature often poses that duality as a controversy, whereas this article develops the pair as complementary tools that together provide deeper understanding. Along the way, the unified approach clarifies the subtle distinctions between kin selection, multilevel selection, and inclusive fitness, subsuming these topics into the broader perspectives of fundamental forces and multiple scales.</description>

      <title>Bioenergetic trophic trade-offs determine mass-dependent extinction thresholds across the Cenozoic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Body size drives the energetic demands of organisms, constraining trophic interactions between species and playing a significant role in shaping the feasibility of species' populations in a community. On macroevolutionary timescales, these demands feed back to shape the selective landscape driving the evolution of body size and diet. We develop a theoretical framework for a three-level trophic food chain -- typical for terrestrial mammalian ecosystems -- premised on bioenergetic trade-offs to explore mammalian population dynamics. Our results show that interactions between predators, prey, and external subsidies generate instabilities linked to body size extrema, corresponding to observed limits of predator size and diet. These instabilities generate size-dependent constraints on coexistence and highlight a feasibility range for carnivore size between 40 to 110 kg, encompassing the mean body size of terrestrial Cenozoic hypercarnivores. Finally, we show that predator dietary generalization confers a selective advantage to larger carnivores, which then declines at megapredator body sizes, aligning with diet breadth estimates for contemporary and Pleistocene species. Our framework underscores the importance of understanding macroevolutionary constraints through the lens of ecological pressures, where the selective forces shaping and reshaping the dynamics of communities can be explored.</description>
