      <title>Advances in RNA secondary structure prediction and RNA modifications: Methods, data, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the hierarchical organization of RNA structures and their pivotal roles in fulfilling RNA functions, the formation of RNA secondary structure critically influences many biological processes and has thus been a crucial research topic. This review sets out to explore the computational prediction of RNA secondary structure and its connections to RNA modifications, which have emerged as an active domain in recent years. We first examine the progression of RNA secondary structure prediction methodology, focusing on a set of representative works categorized into thermodynamic, comparative, machine learning, and hybrid approaches. Next, we survey the advances in RNA modifications and computational methods for identifying RNA modifications, focusing on the prominent modification types. Subsequently, we highlight the interplay between RNA modifications and secondary structures, emphasizing how modifications such as m6A dynamically affect RNA folding and vice versa. In addition, we also review relevant data sources and provide a discussion of current challenges and opportunities in the field. Ultimately, we hope our review will be able to serve as a cornerstone to aid in the development of innovative methods for this emerging topic and foster therapeutic applications in the future.</description>

      <title>How Large is the Universe of RNA-Like Motifs? A Clustering Analysis of RNA Graph Motifs Using Topological Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computational topology-based approach with unsupervised machine-learning algorithms to estimate the database size and content of RNA-like graph topologies. Specifically, we apply graph theory enumeration to generate all 110,667 possible 2D dual graphs for vertex numbers ranging from 2 to 9. Among them, only 0.11% graphs correspond to approximately 200,000 known RNA atomic fragments (collected in 2021) using the RNA-as-Graphs (RAG) mapping method. The remaining 99.89% of the dual graphs may be RNA-like or non-RNA-like. To determine which dual graphs in the 99.89% hypothetical set are more likely to be associated with RNA structures, we apply computational topology descriptors using the Persistent Spectral Graphs (PSG) method to characterize each graph using 19 PSG-based features and use clustering algorithms that partition all possible dual graphs into two clusters, RNA-like cluster and non-RNA-like cluster. The distance of each dual graph to the center of the RNA-like cluster represents the likelihood of it belonging to RNA structures. From validation, our PSG-based RNA-like cluster includes 97.3% of the 121 known RNA dual graphs, suggesting good performance. Furthermore, 46.017% of the hypothetical RNAs are predicted to be RNA-like. Significantly, we observe that all the top 15 RNA-like dual graphs can be separated into multiple subgraphs, whereas the top 15 non-RNA-like dual graphs tend not to have any subgraphs. Moreover, a significant topological difference between top RNA-like and non-RNA-like graphs is evident when comparing their topological features. These findings provide valuable insights into the size of the RNA motif universe and RNA design strategies, offering a novel framework for predicting RNA graph topologies and guiding the discovery of novel RNA motifs, perhaps anti-viral therapeutics by subgraph assembly.</description>

      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptides prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model, employing an Extra-Trees classifier, has been validated on the AntiCP 2.0 and mACPpred 2.0 benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance or results comparable to existing deep learning models, while providing greater interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>
