      <title>A pilot cohort study of a microfluidic-based point-of-care bilirubin measurement system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective The concentration of bilirubin in blood or serum is useful for assessing liver function as well as monitoring treatment. This study evaluates the clinical performance of a novel point-of-care (PoC) device for the detection of bilirubin in serum. The PoC device incorporates an integrated miniature optoelectronic sensing module and a microfluidic test cartridge.
  Methods Patients' serum total bilirubin concentrations, ranging from 2 {\mu}mol/L to 480 {\mu}mol/L, were measured using the PoC device and the standard laboratory method (n=20). Bland-Altman analysis and regression analysis using Passing-Bablok method were used to benchmark the PoC device against the standard laboratory measurements. The diagnostic capability of the PoC device in categorising the serum samples within clinically relevant bilirubin concentration thresholds of 200, 300, and 450 {\mu}mol/L was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
  Results The mean difference between the PoC device and the standard laboratory method was -5.6 {\mu}mol/L, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -45.1 {\mu}mol/L to 33.9 {\mu}mol/L. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.986. The PoC device achieved a detection sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 97% in categorising bilirubin concentrations within bands used in clinical decision-making.
  Conclusions This study demonstrates that the proposed PoC device is capable of measuring bilirubin levels in patient samples with clinically acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>MORSE: Multiple Orthogonal Reference Sensitivity Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel imaging is ubiquitous in MRI, enabling diverse applications such as ultra-high-resolution functional and quantitative imaging with greater temporal resolution or reduced scan times respectively. Successful unfolding is contingent on robust and accurate estimation of the relative coil sensitivities, which often involves computation times that preclude real-time deployment. Here we present a computationally-efficient method of robustly estimating coil sensitivities, and reconstructing under-sampled images using a data-driven regularised SENSE formalism. Our MORSE scheme estimates multiple sensitivities per voxel to address issues such as rapidly varying sensitivities, chemical shift artefact, or insufficient fields of view and provides a data-driven regularisation term for noise control. Exemplar structural and functional image reconstructions at 3T and 7T are presented and compared with a vendor-provided GRAPPA reconstruction as well as state-of-the-art ESPIRiT and LORAKS algorithms. MORSE consistently produced high-quality, artefact-free images with reconstruction times feasible for real-time deployment. It is flexible and robust, and made available to the community in open-source as a library of functions within the vendor-agnostic Gadgetron image reconstruction framework.</description>

      <title>Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined. Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500 Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity, and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients. Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.</description>

      <title>Differential Analysis of Pseudo Haptic Feedback: Novel Comparative Study of Visual and Auditory Cue Integration for Psychophysical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440 Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional "knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3, respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators, opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and assistive interfaces.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Diffusion Models for Sparse-View Motion-Corrected Head Cone-beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14033v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an imaging modality widely used in head and neck diagnostics due to its accessibility and lower radiation dose. However, its relatively long acquisition times make it susceptible to patient motion, especially under sparse-view settings used to reduce dose, which can result in severe image artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) with adaptive diffusion model (ADM), that simultaneously addresses motion compensation and sparse-view reconstruction in head CBCT. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion-based generative models, our method integrates a wavelet-domain diffusion prior into an iterative reconstruction pipeline to guide the solution toward anatomically plausible volumes while estimating rigid motion parameters in a blind fashion. We evaluate our method on simulated motion-affected CBCT data derived from real clinical computed tomography (CT) volumes. Experimental results demonstrate that JRM- ADM achieves consistent quantitative improvements over both traditional and learning-based baselines. In highly undersampled cases, JRM-ADM improves peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by more than 4 dB and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) by 0.10 compared to baseline the motion-corrected (MC) reconstruction method. These results highlight the potential of our approach to enable motion-robust and low-dose CBCT imaging, paving the way for improved clinical viability.

      <title>Semi-Supervised Radiomics for Glioblastoma IDH Mutation: Limited Labels, Data Sensitivity, and SHAP Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor in which IDH mutation status is a key prognostic biomarker, but traditional testing requires invasive biopsies, emphasizing the need for non-invasive approaches. In this multi-center study, we analyzed MRI sequences (T1, T2-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1, and FLAIR) from 1,329 patients across eight centers, with IDH labels available for 1,061 cases. A total of 1,223 radiomic features per case were extracted using PyRadiomics with Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelet filters, and both supervised learning (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks were applied, incorporating 38 feature selection/attribute extraction strategies and 24 classifiers. Five-fold cross-validation was performed on UCSF-PDGM and UPENN datasets, and external validation on IvyGAP, TCGA-LGG, and TCGA-GBM, with SHAP analysis conducted for feature interpretability. Multimodal MRI fusion (T1+T2+T1CE+FLAIR) consistently outperformed single-sequence models. The best SSL model (RFE + SVM) achieved 0.93 cross-validation and 0.75 external accuracy, while the top SL model (RFE + Complement Naive Bayes) reached 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. SSL further demonstrated greater robustness to limited sample sizes, maintaining stable performance compared to SL, and SHAP analysis highlighted the amplified role of first-order Root Mean Square (T1CE) and wavelet-based features, strengthening biomarker interpretability. These findings indicate that SSL enhances accuracy, stability, and interpretability in MRI-based IDH prediction, with multimodal MRI fusion providing the most scalable and reliable strategy for non-invasive biomarker discovery in GBM.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Driven Spike Encoding for Fully Implantable Cochlear Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This work aims to demonstrate a low-power, biomimetic auditory sensing concept for fully implantable cochlear implants. The approach draws inspiration from the frequency selectivity and temporal encoding of the cochlea, and uses neuromorphic spike generation to replace conventional signal processing blocks. The goal is to establish a compact, energy-efficient front-end architecture suitable for future implantable systems. Methods: An auditory sensing unit was implemented, consisting of a piezoelectric MEMS cantilever mechanically coupled to a single VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator. This configuration enables FFT-free, frequency-selective sensing and direct spike generation, forming a biomimetic auditory front end. The concept was experimentally examined using controlled mechanical excitation. Results: The sensing unit exhibited frequency-selective detection of mechanical vibrations in the nanometer to tens-of-nanometers displacement range and generated biomimetic spiking waveforms. Spike rate-encoding of the input amplitude was demonstrated, with output spiking frequencies tunable between approximately 100 Hz and 1 kHz depending on the excitation level. The waveform was finally converted to a biphasic shape suitable for cochlear implant stimulation. Significance: Temporal encoding is fundamental to natural auditory signal processing in the nervous system. By implementing this principle through neuromorphic spike encoding, the proposed approach can provide significant benefits for cochlear implants. In addition, the circuit has the potential to reduce footprint, energy consumption, and latencies compared with current commercial solutions.</description>
