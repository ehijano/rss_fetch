      <title>Convergence rate of $\ell^p$-energy minimization on graphs: sharp polynomial bounds and a phase transition at $p=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following dynamics on a connected graph $(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices. Given $p&gt;1$ and an initial opinion profile $f_0:V \to [0,1]$, at each integer step $t \ge 1$ a uniformly random vertex $v=v_t$ is selected, and the opinion there is updated to the value $f_{t}(v)$ that minimizes the sum $\sum_{w \sim v} |f_t(v)-f_{t-1}(w)|^p$ over neighbours $w$ of $v$. The case $p=2$ yields linear averaging dynamics, but for all $p \ne 2$ the dynamics are nonlinear. In the limiting case $p=\infty$ (known as Lipschitz learning), $f_t(v)$ is the average of the largest and smallest values of $f_{t-1}(w)$ among the neighbours $w$ of $v$. We show that the number of steps needed to reduce the oscillation of $f_t$ below $\epsilon$ is at most $n^{\beta_p}$ (up to logarithmic factors in $n$ and $\epsilon$), where $\beta_p:=max(\frac{2p}{p-1},3)$; we prove that the exponent $\beta_p$ is optimal. The phase transition at $p=3$ is a new phenomenon. We also derive matching upper and lower bounds for convergence time as a function of $n$ and the average degree; these are the most challenging to prove.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Limit of the Symmetric Zero-Range Process with Slow Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic behaviour of the symmetric zero-range process on the finite interval $\{1, \ldots, N-1\}$ in contact with slow reservoirs at the boundary. Particles are injected and removed at sites $1$ and $N-1$ at rates that scale like $N^{-\theta}$ with $\theta\ge1$. Under mild assumptions on the jump rate and the sequence of initial measures, we show that the empirical density evolves on the diffusive scale according to a nonlinear heat equation, with boundary conditions reflecting the strength of the reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Collisions of random walks on comb graphs with a planar base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study collisions of two independent random walks on comb graphs $\mathrm{Comb}(\tilde{G},f)$ for a large class of recurrent planar graphs $\tilde{G}$ and profile functions $f$, the latter governing the length of vertical segments (called "teeth") attached to vertices of the base graph $\tilde{G}$. We prove that the number of collisions of two random walks starting from the same site undergoes a phase transition depending on the growth of $f$. As a benchmark example, we show that for $\mathrm{Comb}(\mathbb{Z}^2,f_\gamma)$ with $f_\gamma(z) = \log^{\gamma}(\|z\|_\infty\vee 1)$ and $\|\cdot \|_\infty$ denoting the supremum norm, two independent random walks started at the origin collide finitely often almost surely if $\gamma &gt; 1$, answering a question of Barlow, Peres, and Sousi, see arXiv:1003.3255, who established that infinitely many collisions occur almost surely if $\gamma \leq 1$. We furthermore establish phase transitions in the cases where the base graph $\tilde{G}$ is pre-fractal, or a typical realization of a supercritical cluster of planar Bernoulli bond percolation.</description>

      <title>Solidification estimates for random walks on supercritical percolation clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the simple random walk on the infinite cluster of a general class of percolation models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$, including Bernoulli percolation as well as models with strong, algebraically decaying correlations. For almost every realization of the percolation configuration, we obtain uniform controls on the absorption probability of a random walk by certain "porous interfaces" surrounding the discrete blow-up of a compact set $A$. These controls substantially generalize previous results obtained in arXiv:1706.07229 for Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and in arXiv:2012.05230 for random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ equipped with uniformly elliptic edge weights to a manifestly non-elliptic framework.</description>

      <title>Estimating non-linear functionals of trawl processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19949v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trawl processes is a family of continuous-time, infinitely divisible, stationary processes whose correlation structure is entirely characterized by its so-called trawl function. This paper investigates the problem of estimating non-linear functionals of a trawl function under an in-fill and a long-span sampling scheme. Specifically, building on the work of \cite{SauriVeraart23}, we introduce non-parametric estimators for functionals of the type $\Psi_{t}(g)=\int_{0}^{t}g(a(s))\mathrm{d}s$ and $ \Lambda_t(g)=\int_{t}^{\infty}g(a(s))\mathrm{d}s$ where $a$ represents the trawl function of interest and $g$ a non-linear test function. We show that our estimator for $\Psi_{t}(g)$ is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian regardless of the memory of the process. We further demonstrates that the same phenomenon occurs for the estimation of $\Lambda_t(g)$ as long as $g(x)= \mathrm{O} (\lvert x\rvert^p)$, as $x\to0$, for some $p&gt;3$. Additionally, we illustrate how our results can be used to test the presence of $T$-dependent data that is robust to persistence.</description>

      <title>Critical lack of equilibrium in stochastic kinetic proofreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the relation between the property of detailed balance and the ability of discriminating between different ligands for a class of stochastic models of kinetic proofreading. We prove the existence of a critical amount of lack of detailed balance that the kinetic proofreading models must have in order to have strong specificity for a value of the binding energy $\sigma$. We also prove that the fact that a kinetic proofreading model has a lack of detailed balance that is larger than the critical one does not necessarily yield strong discrimination properties. Indeed, there exist different sets of chemical rates, leading to the same amount of lack of detailed balance, that have strong discrimination property in some cases and not in others.</description>

      <title>Stretched Brownian Motion: convergence of dual optimising sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an irreducible pair $\mu \leq_c \nu$ of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in convex order. In arXiv:2306.11019, Backhoff, Beiglb\"ock, Schachermayer and Tschiderer have shown that the Stretched Brownian Motion from $\mu$ to $\nu$ is a Bass martingale, that there exists a dual optimiser $\psi_{lim}$, and the following somewhat surprising convergence result: by adding affine functions, one can make any dual optimising sequence $(\psi_n)_n$ (satisfying some minor technical conditions) converge pointwise to $\psi_{lim}$, save possibly on the relative boundary of the convex hull of the support of $\nu$. In the present paper we deal with the more delicate issue of convergence on said boundary, showing in particular that $\psi_{lim}$ is $\nu$ a.s. finite, and $(\psi_n)_n$ converges to $\psi_{lim}$ in $\nu$-measure.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue distribution of the Neural Tangent Kernel in the quadratic scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the neural tangent kernel of a two-layer neural network under a specific scaling of dimension. Namely, if $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ is an i.i.d random matrix, $W\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times p}$ is an i.i.d $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ matrix and $D\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ is a diagonal matrix with i.i.d bounded entries, we consider the matrix
  \[
  \mathrm{NTK}
  =
  \frac{1}{d}XX^\top
  \odot
  \frac{1}{p}
  \sigma'\left(
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}XW
  \right)D^2
  \sigma'\left(
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}XW
  \right)^\top
  \]
  where $\sigma'$ is a pseudo-Lipschitz function applied entrywise and under the scaling $\frac{n}{dp}\to \gamma_1$ and $\frac{p}{d}\to \gamma_2$. We describe the asymptotic distribution as the free multiplicative convolution of the Marchenko--Pastur distribution with a deterministic distribution depending on $\sigma$ and $D$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic size of the Karp-Sipser Core in Configuration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic size of the Karp-Sipser core in the configuration model with arbitrary degree distributions. The Karp-Sipser core is the induced subgraph obtained by iteratively removing all leaves and their neighbors through the leaf-removal process, and finally discarding any isolated vertices \cite{BCC}. Our main result establishes the convergence of the Karp-Sipser core size to an explicit fixed-point equation under general degree assumptions.The approach is based on analyzing the corresponding local weak limit of the configuration model - a unimodular Galton-Watson tree and tracing the evolution process of all vertex states under leaf-removal dynamics by use of the working mechanism of an enhanced version of Warning Propagation along with Node Labeling Propagation.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorems for Constrained Mittag-Leffler Ensemble in Hard Edge Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the hard-edge scaling of the Mittag-Leffler ensemble confined to a fixed disk inside the droplet. Our primary emphasis is on fluctuations of rotationally-invariant additive statistics that depend on the radius and thus give rise to radius-dependent stochastic processes. For the statistics originating from bounded measurable functions, we establish a central limit theorem in the appropriate functional space. By assuming further regularity, we are able to extend the result to a vector functional central limit theorem that additionally includes the first hitting "time" of the radius-dependent statistic. The proof of the first theorem involves an approximation by exponential random variables alongside a coupling technique. The proof of the second result rests heavily on Skorohod's almost sure representation theorem and builds upon a result of Galen Shorack (1973).</description>

      <title>Volterra equations with affine drift: looking for stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the solutions of scaled Volterra equations (i.e. with an affine mean-reverting drift) in terms of stationarity at both a finite horizon and on the long run. In particular we prove that such an equation never has a stationary regime, except if the kernel is constant (i.e. the equation is a standard Brownian diffusion) or in some fully degenerate pathological settings. We introduce a deterministic stabilizer $ \varsigma$ associated to the kernel which produces a {\em fake stationary regime} in the sense that all the marginals share the same expectation and variance. We also show that the marginals of such a process starting from when starting various initial values are confluent in $L^2$ as time goes to infinity. We establish that for some classes of diffusion coefficients (square root of positive quadratic polynomials) the time shifted solutions of such Volterra equations weakly functionally converges toward a family of $L^2$-stationary processes sharing the same covariance function. We apply these results to (stabilized) rough volatility models (when the kernel $K(t)= t^{H-\frac 12}$, $0&lt;H&lt;\frac 12$) which leads to produce a fake stationary quadratic rough Heston model.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion on the circle and multiradial SLE(0+)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a finite-time large deviation principle (LDP) for "Dyson type" diffusion processes, including Dyson Brownian motion on the circle, for a fixed number of particles as the coupling parameter $\beta=8/\kappa$ tends to $\infty$. We also characterize the large-time behavior of finite-energy and zero-energy systems. Interestingly, the latter correspond to the Calogero-Moser-Sutherland integrable system.
  We use these results to derive an LDP in the Hausdorff metric for multiradial Schramm-Loewner evolution, SLE$_\kappa$, as $\kappa \to 0$, with good rate function being the multiradial Loewner energy. Here, the main difficulty is that the curves have a common target point, preventing the configurational (global) approach. Our proof thus requires topological results in Loewner theory: using a derivative estimate for the radial Loewner map in terms of the energy of its driving function, we show that finite-energy multiradial Loewner hulls are disjoint unions of simple curves, except possibly at their common endpoint.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling-invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Behavior of Erlang-C Model: Mixing Time, Mean Queue Length and Tail Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service systems like data centers and ride-hailing are popularly modeled as queueing systems in the literature. Such systems are primarily studied in the steady state due to their analytical tractability. However, almost all applications in real life do not operate in a steady state, so there is a clear discrepancy in translating theoretical queueing results to practical applications. To this end, we provide a finite-time convergence for Erlang-C systems (also known as $M/M/n$ queues), providing a stepping stone towards understanding the transient behavior of more general queueing systems. We obtain a bound on the Chi-square distance between the finite time queue length distribution and the stationary distribution for a finite number of servers. We then use these bounds to study the behavior in the many-server heavy-traffic asymptotic regimes. The Erlang-C model exhibits a phase transition at the so-called Halfin-Whitt regime. We show that our mixing rate matches the limiting behavior in the Super-Halfin-Whitt regime, and matches up to a constant factor in the Sub-Halfin-Whitt regime.
  To prove such a result, we employ the Lyapunov-Poincar\'e approach, where we first carefully design a Lyapunov function to obtain a negative drift outside a finite set. Within the finite set, we develop different strategies depending on the properties of the finite set to get a handle on the mixing behavior via a local Poincar\'e inequality. A key aspect of our methodological contribution is in obtaining tight guarantees in these two regions, which when combined give us tight mixing time bounds. We believe that this approach is of independent interest for studying mixing in reversible countable-state Markov chains more generally.</description>

      <title>On the critical parameters of branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a discrete spatial structure $X$, we define continuous-time branching processes that model a population breeding and dying on $X$. These processes are usually called branching random walks. They are characterized by breeding rates $k_{xy}$ between sites (ruling the speed at which individuals at $x$ send children to $y$) and by the multiplicative speed parameter $\lambda$. Two critical parameters of interest are the global critical parameter $\lambda_w$, related to global survival, and the local critical parameter $\lambda_s$, related to survival in finite sets (with $\lambda_w\le\lambda_s)$. Local modifications of the rates of the process can affect the value of both parameters. Using results on the comparison of the probability of extinction of a single branching random walk on different sets, we are able to extend the comparison to extinction probabilities and critical parameters of couples of branching random walks, whose rates coincide outside a fixed set $A\subseteq X$. We say that two branching random walks are equivalent if their rates coincide everywhere but for a finite subset of $X$. Given an equivalence class of branching random walks, we prove that if one process has $\lambda^*_w\neq\lambda^*_s$, then $\lambda_w^*$ is the maximal possible value of this parameter in the class. We describe the possible situations for the critical parameters in these equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Estimation through Kirchhoff Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a non-oriented edge-weighted graph, we show how to make some estimation of the associated Laplacian eigenvalues through Monte Carlo evaluation of spectral quantities computed along Kirchhoff random rooted spanning forest trajectories. The sampling cost of this estimation is only linear in the node number, up to a logarithmic factor. By associating a double cover of such a graph with any symmetric real matrix, we can then perform spectral estimation in the same way for the latter.</description>

      <title>Perfect t-embeddings of doubly periodic Aztec diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-scale geometry of t-surfaces -- pairs of perfect t-embeddings and their associated origami maps -- arising from dimer models on Aztec diamonds with periodic edge weights. We prove that these t-surfaces converge to space-like maximal surfaces in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$. We observe that the frozen and gas regions influence the geometry of the limiting surface in striking ways: all frozen regions collapse to four boundary points, regardless of the number of frozen regions, while each gas region collapses to a distinct light-like cusp in the interior of the surface. In the absence of gas regions, the limiting surface lies entirely within $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$; in the general case, however, this is no longer true.
  The limiting surface is sensitive to the detailed structure of the model: both the positions of the cusps, and the placement of the boundary vertices, depend on the precise way the edge weights are distributed on the Aztec diamond. Nevertheless, we show that the global conformal structure remains robust and coincides with the Kenyon-Okounkov conformal structure. We further conjecture that the cusp locations encode the shift in the discrete Gaussian component that appears in the global fluctuations of the dimer model.</description>

      <title>The discrete periodic Pitman transform: invariances, braid relations, and Burke properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the discrete periodic Pitman transform, first introduced by Corwin, Gu, and the fifth author. We prove that, for polymers in a periodic environment, single-path and multi-path partition functions are preserved under the action of this transform on the weights in the polymer model. As a corollary, we prove that the discrete periodic Pitman transform satisfies the same braid relations that are satisfied for the full-line Pitman transform shown by Biane, Bougerol, and O'Connell. Combined with a new inhomogeneous Burke property for the periodic Pitman transform, we prove a multi-path invariance result for the periodic inverse-gamma polymer under permutations of the column parameters. In the limit to the full-line case, we obtain a multi-path extension of a recent invariance result of Bates, Emrah, Martin, Sepp\"al\"ainen, and the fifth author, in both positive and zero-temperature.</description>

      <title>Greedy Matching in Optimal Transport with concave cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal transport problem between a set of $n$ red points and a set of $n$ blue points subject to a concave cost function such as $c(x,y) = \|x-y\|^{p}$ for $0&lt; p &lt; 1$. Our focus is on a particularly simple matching algorithm: match the closest red and blue point, remove them both and repeat. We prove that it provides good results in any metric space $(X,d)$ when the cost function is $c(x,y) = d(x,y)^{p}$ with $0 &lt; p &lt; 1/2$. Empirically, the algorithm produces results that are remarkably close to optimal -- especially as the cost function gets more concave; this suggests that greedy matching may be a good toy model for Optimal Transport for very concave transport cost.</description>

Abstract: We consider random walks on edge coloured random graphs, where the colour of an edge reflects the cost of using it. In the simplest instance, the edges are coloured red or blue. Blue edges are free to use, whereas red edges incur a unit cost every time they are traversed.</description>

      <title>Conformally covariant probabilities, operator product expansions, and logarithmic correlations in two-dimensional critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale behavior of two-dimensional critical percolation is expected to be described by a conformal field theory (CFT). Moreover, this putative CFT is believed to be of the logarithmic type, exhibiting logarithmic corrections to the most commonly encountered behavior of CFT correlations. While constructing a full-fledged percolation CFT is still an open problem, in this paper we prove various CFT features of the scaling limit of two-dimensional critical percolation. In particular, we provide the first rigorous proof of the emergence of logarithmic singularities in the scaling limit of connection probabilities. More precisely, we study several connectivity events, including arm-events and the events that a vertex is pivotal or belongs to the percolation backbone, whose probabilities have conformally covariant scaling limits and can be interpreted as CFT correlation functions. For some of these probabilities, we prove asymptotic expansions that can be regarded as CFT operator product expansions (OPEs). Our analysis identifies various logarithmic singularities and explains the geometric mechanism that produces them. In follow-up work, the results of this paper are used to define a percolation energy field and its logarithmic partner.</description>

      <title>Statistical learning does not always entail knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study learning and knowledge acquisition (LKA) of an agent about a proposition that is either true or false. We use a Bayesian approach, where the agent receives data to update his beliefs about the proposition according to a posterior distribution. The LKA is formulated in terms of active information, with data representing external or exogenous information that modifies the agent's beliefs. It is assumed that data provide details about a number of features that are relevant to the proposition. We show that this leads to a Gibbs distribution posterior, which is in maximum entropy relative to the prior, conditioned on the side constraints that the data provide in terms of the features. We demonstrate that full learning is sometimes not possible and full knowledge acquisition is never possible when the number of extracted features is too small. We also distinguish between primary learning (receiving data about features of relevance for the proposition) and secondary learning (receiving data about the learning of another agent). We argue that this type of secondary learning does not represent true knowledge acquisition. Our results have implications for statistical learning algorithms, and we claim that such algorithms do not always generate true knowledge. The theory is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Diffusion Annealing-Based Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the ascendance of diffusion modeling as a state-of-the-art generative modeling approach has spurred significant interest in their use as priors in Bayesian inverse problems. However, it is unclear how to optimally integrate a diffusion model trained on the prior distribution with a given likelihood function to obtain posterior samples. While algorithms developed for this purpose can produce high-quality, diverse point estimates of the unknown parameters of interest, they are often tested on problems where the prior distribution is analytically unknown, making it difficult to assess their performance in providing rigorous uncertainty quantification. Motivated by this challenge, this work introduces three benchmark problems for evaluating the performance of diffusion model based samplers. The benchmark problems, which are inspired by problems in image inpainting, x-ray tomography, and phase retrieval, have a posterior density that is analytically known. In this setting, approximate ground-truth posterior samples can be obtained, enabling principled evaluation of the performance of posterior sampling algorithms. This work also introduces a general framework for diffusion model based posterior sampling, Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing (BIPSDA). This framework unifies several recently proposed diffusion-model-based posterior sampling algorithms and contains novel algorithms that can be realized through flexible combinations of design choices. We tested the performance of a set of BIPSDA algorithms, including previously proposed state-of-the-art approaches, on the proposed benchmark problems. The results provide insight into the strengths and limitations of existing diffusion-model based posterior samplers, while the benchmark problems provide a testing ground for future algorithmic developments.</description>
