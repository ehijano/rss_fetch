      <title>An Open-Source High-Level Graphical Signal Processing Language with Simulation and HDL Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CASPER (Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronic Research) toolflow is a widely used framework for designing and implementing digital signal processing systems, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable researchers to create custom hardware and software solutions for processing astronomical data. The CASPER toolflow has been instrumental in the development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based digital instruments for various radio telescopes, enabling for real-time data processing and analysis. However, the current frontend tool that CASPER uses for high-level FPGA design is based on Model Composer integrated into MATLAB/Simulink, which is a proprietary software. In this paper, we introduce Scilab as a new frontend tool for the CASPER toolflow. Scilab is an open-source software platform for numerical computation and data visualization, which offers a similar environment to MATLAB/Simulink for designing CASPER blocks, generating FPGA Intellectual Property (IP) cores, and simulating Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. We present our implementation of Scilab in the CASPER toolflow and demonstrate its capabilities by developing an FPGA based spectrometer on a RFSoC4x2, a commonly used CASPER platform well suited to radio astronomy applications. We have also developed Scilab support for other CASPER compatible platforms. Our results show that Scilab can successfully be used as an alternate frontend for CASPER-based designs.</description>

      <title>WFC3/UVIS: External CTE Monitoring 2009-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report examines Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) flux losses in the Wide Field Camera 3 UVIS detector aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Spanning approximately 14 years of observations from October 2009 to February 2024, the study analyzes CTE flux loss trends across various total background levels and source fluxes. In addition to analyzing the present state of CTE flux losses, we provide updated coefficients for the empirical model for point source photometry corrections in both non-CTE-corrected (FLT) and CTE-corrected (FLC) data. Between 2009 and 2023, the rate of CTE flux loss for a 500-2000 e$^-$ source, farthest from the readout, in FLT data with a 1-3 e$^-$/pix background, is measured to be $\sim$0.05 $\Delta$mag/2051 pix/year. The recommended minimum total background level to mitigate CTE losses remains at 20-25 e$^-$/pix. At that level, we find that 500-2000 e$^-$ sources, farthest from the readout, in 2024 FLT data can suffer $\sim$23$\%$ flux loss/2051 pix. The FLC data provide some relief, but we measure a $\sim$12$\%$ flux loss/2051 pix in 2024. There continues to be a slight over-correction in some FLC results that contain backgrounds above 40 e$^-$/pix. In 2024, 8000-20000 e$^-$ sources farthest from the readout in a 40, 60, or 90 e$^-$/pix background are over-corrected by $\sim$1, 2, and 3$\%$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Imagining the Alien: Human Projections and Cognitive Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagining what life on other planets, and intelligent life in particular, may be like is a long-running theme in human culture. It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres. It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). As its capabilities grow, it may give us new insights into what extraterrestrial advanced intelligences may be like.</description>

      <title>Sunrise III: The Wavefront Correction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the wave-front correction and image stabilisation system (CWS) developed for the Sunrise III balloon-borne telescope, and provides information about its performance as measured during the integration into the telescope and during the 2024 science flight. The fast image stabilisation is done by a correlation tracker (CT) and a fast tip-tilt mirror, low order aberrations such as defocus and coma are measured by a six-element Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) and corrected by an active telescope secondary mirror for automated focus and manual coma correction. The CWS is specified to deliver a stabilised image with a precision of 0.005 arcsec (rms). The autofocus adjustment is specified to maintain a focus stability of 0.01 waves in the focal plane of the CWS.</description>

      <title>Toward Vision-Language Assistants for Radio Astronomical Source Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in general-purpose reasoning tasks, yet their applicability to domain-specific scientific workflows remains largely unexplored. In this work, we evaluated a series of open-weight and commercial VLMs on six tasks relevant to radio astronomy, such as source morphology classification. We also introduced radio-llava, a fine-tuned multimodal assistant built on the LLaVA architecture and adapted for the radio domain through instruction fine-tuning.
  In zero-shot mode, commercial models like GPT-4.1 outperform open-weight VLMs on most radio benchmarks. However, radio-llava significantly improves upon both base LLaVA and commercial models across nearly all tasks. Despite these gains, specialized vision-only models still deliver substantially better performance across the board. Additionally, we observed that fine-tuning introduces catastrophic forgetting on general multimodal tasks, with performance drops up to 40% that can be partly mitigated with a more diverse training dataset or shallow fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Scintillation muon telescope module with fiber-optic light collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scintillation muon telescope module with fiber-optic light collection using silicon photomultipliers was developed, tested, and installed for continuous monitoring to study cosmic ray variations. The aim of this study was to create a scintillation muon telescope module, continuously monitor the muon component in test mode, and study the long-term stability of the detector parameters. Methods for processing the obtained data were developed. To assess the stability of the module parameters, an internal control technique was used, involving data from other detectors. The results of testing and long-term continuous monitoring showed that the stability of the developed muon detector is better than 0.1%/year, without the need for its operation in a thermostatic chamber. The study concludes that ease of operation, cost, compactness, low power consumption and stability are factors that determine the advantages of the developed module, which is an essential element for constructing a multidirectional muon telescope.</description>

      <title>SOLO: wide-field asteroid light curve monitoring system for SPHEREx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Solar system Objects Light curve Observatory (SOLO), a wide-field, high-cadence optical survey system designed to obtain absolutely calibrated asteroid light curves, converted to the Gaia G-band photometric system, in support of the SPHEREx Solar System Object Catalog (SSOC). SOLO was installed at the Sierra Remote Observatories (SRO) in California, USA, in July 2025 and is optimized for continuous, multi-night monitoring of asteroid brightness variations. We describe the system configuration, remote operation, and data reduction pipeline, and evaluate its optical and photometric performance using commissioning data. SOLO achieves stable photometric calibration across the 11.6 deg^2 field of view and reaches a 10-sigma limiting magnitude of G ~ 17.5 for a 180 sec exposure. Sample asteroid light curves obtained over multiple nights demonstrate consistent absolute photometry at the same rotational phase, validating the estimated performance. Finally, we outline the planned operational use of SOLO in connection with NASA's SPHEREx mission. Full science operations of SOLO are scheduled to begin in January 2026. Using these data, we aim to obtain on the order of 10^3 absolutely calibrated asteroid light curves per year in the Gaia G-band, which will be used to support the construction and scientific utilization of the SPHEREx SSOC.</description>

      <title>DerivKit: stable numerical derivatives bridging Fisher forecasts and MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DerivKit is a Python package for derivative-based statistical inference. It implements stable numerical differentiation and derivative assembly utilities for Fisher-matrix forecasting and higher-order likelihood approximations in scientific applications, supporting scalar- and vector-valued models including black-box or tabulated functions where automatic differentiation is impractical or unavailable. These derivatives are used to construct Fisher forecasts, Fisher bias estimates, and non-Gaussian likelihood expansions based on the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods (DALI). By extending derivative-based inference beyond the Gaussian approximation, DerivKit forms a practical bridge between fast Fisher forecasts and more computationally intensive sampling-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).</description>

      <title>Particle hydrodynamics with accurate gradients: a comparison of different formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare here several modern versions of SPH with a particular focus on the impact of gradient accuracy. We examine specifically an approximation to the "linearly exact" gradients (aLE) with standard SPH kernel gradients and with linearly reproducing kernels (RPKs) that fulfill the lowest order consistency relations exactly by construction. Most of the explored SPH formulations use shock dissipation (i.e. artificial viscosity and conductivity) with slope-limited reconstruction and parameters that trigger on both shocks and noise. We also compare with a recent particle hydrodynamics formulation that uses both RPKs and Roe's approximate Riemann solver instead of shock dissipation. Not too surprisingly, we find that the shock tests are rather insensitive to the gradient accuracy, but whenever instabilities are involved the gradient accuracy plays a crucial role. The reproducing kernel gradients perform best, but they are closely followed by the much simpler aLE gradients. The Riemann solver approach has some (minor) advantages in the shock tests, but shows some resistance against instability growth and at low resolution the corresponding Kelvin-Helmholtz simulations show substantially slower instability growth than the best shock dissipation approaches. Based on the battery of benchmark tests performed here, we consider a shock dissipation approach with reproducing kernels (our versions $V_3$ and $V_5$) as best, but closely followed by a similar version ($V_2$) that uses the simpler and computationally cheaper aLE gradients.</description>

      <title>Towards FAIR Astrophysical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science. FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data is often a vital step towards testing the reproducibility of results. The implementation of FAIR principles in the astrophysical simulation community is still varied. We approach the discussion of this topic mainly from a high-performance computing (HPC) point of view. We identify the main obstacles to FAIR astrophysics simulations: First, the vast datasets created in simulations on HPC facilities complicate FAIR data management. Second, missing incentives to fully share codes, results, and diagnostic data. Third, a lack of workflows that include data publication and technical support. Therefore, particularly smaller research groups struggle due to the unavailability of dedicated personnel and time in their efforts towards FAIR and open simulations. We propose actionable steps towards achieving ``FAIRer'' data and open source publication standards in numerical astrophysics. Our suggestions include low-threshold methods to fulfil the basic FAIR requirements as well as basic tools for FAIR (meta-)data generation and data/code publication. This work is a high-level overview intended to initiate discussions within the community, offering initial solutions to these challenges.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of AlMn alloy superconducting films for 0vbb experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta decay (0vbb) experiments constitute a pivotal probe for elucidating the characteristics of neutrinos and further discovering new physics. Compared to the neutron transmutation doped germanium thermistors (NTD-Ge) used in 0vbb experiments such as CUORE, transition edge sensors (TES) theoretically have a relatively faster response time and higher energy resolution. These make TES detectors good choice for next generation 0vbb experiments. In this paper, AlMn alloy superconducting films, the main components of TES, were prepared and studied. The relationship between critical temperature (Tc) and annealing temperature was established, and the impact of magnetic field on Tc was tested. The experimental results demonstrate that the Tc of AlMn film can be tuned in the required range of 10 - 20 mK by using the above methods, which is a key step for the application of AlMn TES in 0vbb experiment. In the test range, the Tc of AlMn film is sensitive to out-of-plane magnetic field but not to the in-plane magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that a higher annealing temperature results in a more uniform distribution of Mn ions in depth, which opens a new avenue for elucidating the underlying mechanism for tuning Tc.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of X-ray TES Detectors Based on Annular AlMn Alloy Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AlMn alloy flms are widely fabricated into superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs) for the detection of cosmic microwave background radiation. However, the application in X-ray or gamma-ray detection based on AlMn TES is rarely reported. In this study, X-ray TES detectors based on unique annular AlMn flms are devel-oped. The fabrication processes of TES detectors are introduced in detail. The char-acteristics of three TES samples are evaluated in a dilution refrigerator. The results demonstrate that the I-V characteristics of the three annular TES detectors are highly consistent. The TES detector with the smallest absorber achieved the best energy resolution of 11.0 eV @ 5.9 keV, which is inferior to the theoretical value. The dis-crepancy is mainly attributed to the larger readout electronics noise than expected.</description>

      <title>SunBURST: Deterministic GPU-Accelerated Bayesian Evidence via Mode-Centric Laplace Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence evaluation becomes computationally prohibitive in high dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality and the sequential nature of sampling-based methods. We introduce SunBURST, a deterministic GPU-native algorithm for Bayesian evidence calculation that replaces global volume exploration with mode-centric geometric integration. The pipeline combines radial mode discovery, batched L-BFGS refinement, and Laplace-based analytic integration, treating modes independently and converting large batches of likelihood evaluations into massively parallel GPU workloads.
  For Gaussian and near-Gaussian posteriors, where the Laplace approximation is exact or highly accurate, SunBURST achieves numerical agreement at double-precision tolerance in dimensions up to 1024 in our benchmarks, with sub-linear wall-clock scaling across the tested range. In multimodal Gaussian mixtures, conservative configurations yield sub-percent accuracy while maintaining favorable scaling.
  SunBURST is not intended as a universal replacement for sampling-based inference. Its design targets regimes common in physical parameter estimation and inverse problems, where posterior mass is locally well approximated by Gaussian structure around a finite number of modes. In strongly non-Gaussian settings, the method can serve as a fast geometry-aware evidence estimator or as a preprocessing stage for hybrid workflows. These results show that high-precision Bayesian evidence evaluation can be made computationally tractable in very high dimensions through deterministic integration combined with massive parallelism.</description>

      <title>Scavenger hunt: Selection of obscured active galactic nuclei combining multiband optical variability and colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wide-field optical surveys such as Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) begin operations, time-domain astronomy is facing a data revolution, paving the road for new, expanded variability studies. This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate.</description>

      <title>A New Strategy for Using Spectroscopic Phase Curves to Characterize Non-Transiting Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new time-series analysis strategy for combined-light exoplanet spectroscopic phase curves called the Variable Planetary Infrared Excess (VPIE) method. VPIE can be used to extract information about the planetary flux contribution without the need for the planet to transit, or use of a stellar spectral model. VPIE utilizes a linear combination of a small set of individual spectra to produce an empirical model of the stellar contribution at each time step, thereby normalizing each spectrum and leaving only an imprint of the planet's flux in the residual data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VPIE through simulated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of three known exoplanet orbiting late-type M stars: the warm giant TOI-519 b, the warm sub-Neptune GJ 876 d, and the temperate super-Earth Proxima Centauri b. Our results indicate that though VPIE loses sensitivity for very high redistribution values, it can successfully distinguish between various atmospheric circulation regimes (zero, moderate, or high heat redistribution) and constrain planetary radii for non-unity day-night temperature ratios. While performance for cooler targets may be limited by JWST spectroscopic capabilities at longer wavelengths, future VPIE improvements or new instrumentation could enable characterization of potentially habitable planets. VPIE offers a promising new framework for pulling back the veil on the population of non-transiting planets around nearby M-stars that are otherwise inaccessible to current techniques.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx as a frontier for infrared transients: Classification of new Galactic FU Ori outbursts and classical novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate proof-of-concept of a new strategy for studying infrared (IR) transients enabled by the newly launched SPHEREx space mission, by leveraging its synergy with the NEOWISE space mission. With its fifteen year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage, NEOWISE provides an excellent avenue to discover thousands of slowly evolving infrared outbursts. With its all-sky spectro-photometric coverage and mid-IR sensitivity matching NEOWISE, SPHEREx is uniquely positioned to provide low-resolution IR spectra for the vast majority of these outbursts, several of which are too obscured for ground-based spectroscopic classification. As a demonstration of this approach, we present SPHEREx spectra for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE. This sample includes two previously known FU Orionis-type (FUOr) outbursts whose SPHEREx spectra exhibit clear signatures of cool molecular absorption and three known classical novae showing strong emission lines in SPHEREx. Using these sources as templates, we identify two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova. Our results highlight the potential of SPHEREx for systematic explorations of the relatively underexplored dynamic infrared sky.</description>

      <title>Variation of the sunspot area during the rising and declining phases of the solar cycle supports the toroidal flux loss due to flux emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunspots are obvious observable manifestations of the toroidal magnetic field generated through the dynamo in the convection zone. They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mass Constraints on Transition Disk Perturbers with the G23H Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present dynamical mass constraints on perturbers in 11 transition disk systems using a novel combination of calibrated Hipparcos and Gaia absolute astrometry data. Out of the sample of 11, we find support for companions in seven systems, with significant detections in three. These systems are: HD 142527, where we clearly detect the known low-mass stellar companion HD 142527 B; AB Aurigae, where we detect a low-mass stellar or sub-stellar companion; and MWC 758, where we detect a likely sub-stellar companion. We also find strong evidence of companions to HD 97048 and UX Tau A, and moderate evidence for companions to HD 100546 and CQ Tau. In the four systems with non-detections, we find no evidence for companions more massive than $\sim$6 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 3 au for HD 100453, nor for companions more massive than $\sim$2 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 2 au for TW Hya. We also find no evidence for stellar mass companions with semi-major axes between $\sim$3 and $\sim$25 au for both HD 34282 and RY Lup. In addition to our fiducial model, we perform cross validation between astrometry sources. By comparing results across models, we find tentative evidence of a short timescale excess astrometric noise that may impact some protoplanetary disk systems. We conclude with predictions for the prospects of making dynamical mass constraints on protoplanets in protoplanetary disk systems with Gaia data release 4 using detailed simulations of Gaia DR4 data of PDS 70 and WISPIT 2.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Black Hole Image Generation via Latent Space Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting horizon-scale black hole images currently relies on computationally intensive General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) simulations, which pose a significant bottleneck for rapid parameter exploration and high-precision tests of strong-field gravity. We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Black-hole Emission Tomography with Physics-informed Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the success of static black-hole imaging, the next frontier is the dynamic and 3D imaging of black holes. Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin.</description>

      <title>JWST spectral retrieval of cold directly imaged planet WD0806 b and the first measurement of altitude-dependent K$_{zz}$ in exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WD0806 b is a rare exoplanet companion orbiting a white dwarf, currently with a projected orbital distance of 2500 au. The Spitzer mid-IR photometry suggests that the temperature is as cold as 350K, making it one of the coldest directly imaged exoplanets. In this paper, we present the Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam) F150W2, F200W, F356W, and F444W broadband photometry and a 3--5\um Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRSpec) G395M spectrum obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We develop a new retrieval framework based on the open-source PICASO software that includes additive and multiplicative systematic parameters. Our retrieval results reveal bounded abundances of H$_2$S, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, H$_2$O, and CH$_4$. We present a new chemical analysis framework that utilizes retrieved abundances to measure altitude-dependent eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{\mathrm zz}$) at multiple quenched pressures. We find that the eddy diffusion coefficients decrease from around $10^4$ to $10^2$ $\rm cm^2/s$ as the atmospheric pressure decreases from from 50 to 20 bars. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report altitude-dependent vertical mixing (or, equivalently, quenched-species-dependent vertical mixing) based on the measured molecular abundances of CO, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$. With the 1--21\um NIRCam, NIRSpec and the previously published MIRI data, we measure the bolometric luminosity to be log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = $-6.75\pm0.01$ and derive the mass to be $8\pm 1 \mathrm{M_J}$. The retrieval results suggest that \target has an elevated C/O ratio of 0.76, or 1.3$\times$ solar, sub-solar metallicity ([M/H ]= -0.25), and a nearly solar C/S ratio (1.17x solar).</description>

Abstract: Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures serve as evidence of the intricate mass assembly of galaxies, and dedicatedly studying them promises to give us profound insights into the evolutionary history of galaxies. Furthermore, delving into the properties of star formation (SF) in the LSB regime can broaden our understanding of SF activity in regions characterized by low surface gas density, thereby shedding light on fundamental cosmic processes. However, systematic uncertainties may hamper the exploration of the LSB universe by limiting detectable SB levels. Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this challenge and explore the LSB universe that we have yet to see, we have been developing a novel telescope called K-DRIFT. This paper outlines the telescope's specification and describes various LSB features we aim for, explicitly focusing on nearby individual galaxies. To further advance the capabilities of the K-DRIFT survey, focused on LSB detection, we present several feasible research topics that utilize other survey data together and discuss the role of LSB observation in understanding the evolution of galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08432v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian accelerations of a Mercury orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic modeling of spacecraft motion in Mercury's post-Newtonian local coordinates. This investigation is motivated by the fact that Mercury's post-Newtonian gravitational field (as well as that of any other planet) admits an expansion in terms of multipole moments, which are most appropriately defined in the local reference system. The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upper $100 \, \mathrm{m}$ to $150 \, \mathrm{m}$ of the polar ice sheet, called the firn, has a time-dependent density due to seasonal variations in the surface temperature and snow accumulation. We present RF simulations of an in-ice neutrino-induced radio source that show that these density anomalies create variations in the amplitude and propagation times of radio signals propagating through polar firn at an altitude of ${\sim}3000 \, \mathrm{m}$ above sea level. The received power from signals generated in the ice that refract within the upper ${\sim} 15 \, \mathrm{m}$ firn are subject to a seasonal variation on the order of 10\%. These variations result in an irreducible background uncertainty on the reconstructed neutrino energy and arrival direction for detectors using ice as a detection medium.</description>

Abstract: The aim is to document in some detail the last 35 years of meridian circles, a type of instrument with a fundamental role in astronomy for a very long time, and to do so while witnesses are still alive and can contribute. This is about finding facts. Meridian circles provided fundamental star positions for centuries. These positions were tied to a well-defined celestial coordinate system of right ascension and declination, and accurate proper motions ensured a transformation of the positions over long periods of time. This function of the meridian circles has been taken over by space astrometry and VLBI. The Hipparcos astrometric satellite was approved by ESA in 1980 and launched to a successful 3-year mission in 1989. Its successor, Gaia, completed a mission of 10.5 years in January 2025. An account is given of the last 18 meridian instruments, which were active for some part of the 35 years between 1980 and 2015. This account is based on input kindly supplied in correspondence with many colleagues.</description>

      <title>Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Kernel Phase Interferometry on JWST/MIRI: Prospects for Future Planet Searches Around Post Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel phase interferometry (KPI) is a post-processing technique that treats a conventional telescope as an interferometer by accurately modeling a telescope pupil as an array of virtual subapertures. KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Ephemeris and Almanac Design for Lunar Navigation Satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents almanac and ephemeris message representation for lunar navigation satellites supporting the Lunar Augmented Navigation System (LANS). The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev polynomials, and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite trajectories subject to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body effects. For the ephemeris, a hybrid Chebyshev--Fourier formulation improves fitting accuracy over long arcs while maintaining message compactness under the data-size constraint of the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. For the almanac, a compact low-order polynomial and Fourier model is introduced to capture mid-term orbital variations over a 15-day fitting arc. The approach is validated for multiple orbit regimes, including 30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour polar orbit. Results show that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit for 6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable satellite-visibility identification in warm-start operations.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmological Information from Neural Networks in the Hydrodynamic Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What happens when a black box (neural network) meets a black box (simulation of the Universe)? Recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can infer cosmological parameters from the matter density field in the presence of complex baryonic processes. A key question that arises is, which parts of the cosmic web is the neural network obtaining information from? We shed light on the matter by identifying the Fourier scales, density scales, and morphological features of the cosmic web that CNNs pay most attention to. We find that CNNs extract cosmological information from both high and low density regions: overdense regions provide the most information per pixel, while underdense regions -- particularly deep voids and their surroundings -- contribute significantly due to their large spatial extent and coherent spatial features. Remarkably, we demonstrate that there is negligible degradation in cosmological constraining power after aggressive cutting in both maximum Fourier scale and density. Furthermore, we find similar results when considering both hydrodynamic and gravity-only simulations, implying that neural networks can marginalize over baryonic effects with minimal loss in cosmological constraining power. Our findings point to practical strategies for optimal and robust field-level cosmological inference in the presence of uncertainly modeled astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for High-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Detection with GEO600</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current ground-based interferometers are optimized for sensitivity from a few tens of Hz to about 1 kHz. While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. Small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image compression and processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry with the COMCUBE-S CubeSat Swarm -- Design and Performance Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COMCUBE-S (COMCUBE-S (Compton Telescope CubeSat Swarm) is a proposed mission aimed at understanding the radiation mechanisms of ultra-relativistic jets from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). It consists of a swarm of 16U CubeSats carrying a state-of-the-art Compton polarimeter and a bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) spectrometer to perform timing, spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements of the prompt emission from GRBs. The mission is currently in a feasibility study phase (Phase A) with the European Space Agency to prepare an in-orbit demonstration. Here, we present the simulation work used to optimise the design and operational concept of the microsatellite constellation, as well as estimate the mission performance in terms of GRB detection rate and polarimetry. We used the MEGAlib software to simulate the response function of the gamma-ray instruments, together with a detailed model for the background particle and radiation fluxes in low-Earth orbit. We also developed a synthetic GRB population model to best estimate the detection rate. These simulations show that COMCUBE-S will detect about 2 GRBs per day, which is significantly higher than that of all past and current GRB missions. Furthermore, simulated performance for linear polarisation measurements shows that COMCUBE-S will be able to uniquely distinguish between competing models of the GRB prompt emission, thereby shedding new light on some of the most fundamental aspects of GRB physics.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Magnetic Structures in the Small-Scale Turbulent Dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures, and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with both analytical models and polarisation observations.</description>

      <title>Utilizing anticoincidence veto in a search for gravitational-wave transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise a technique to suppress the effect of noise transients occurring at gravitational-wave detectors based on temporal anticoincidence. Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin. The technique presented here benefits from the fact that the noise effects are generally non-coincident in time at geographically separated detectors. Therefore, abnormally loud detector triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals. The technique is expected to especially improve the detection efficiency of the search for short duration gravitational waves.</description>
