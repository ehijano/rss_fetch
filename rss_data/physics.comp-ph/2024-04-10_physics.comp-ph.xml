      <title>DiffObs: Generative Diffusion for Global Forecasting of Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an autoregressive generative diffusion model (DiffObs) to predict the global evolution of daily precipitation, trained on a satellite observational product, and assessed with domain-specific diagnostics. The model is trained to probabilistically forecast day-ahead precipitation. Nonetheless, it is stable for multi-month rollouts, which reveal a qualitatively realistic superposition of convectively coupled wave modes in the tropics. Cross-spectral analysis confirms successful generation of low frequency variations associated with the Madden--Julian oscillation, which regulates most subseasonal to seasonal predictability in the observed atmosphere, and convectively coupled moist Kelvin waves with approximately correct dispersion relationships. Despite secondary issues and biases, the results affirm the potential for a next generation of global diffusion models trained on increasingly sparse, and increasingly direct and differentiated observations of the world, for practical applications in subseasonal and climate prediction.</description>

      <title>On the conjugate interface conditions and Galilean invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the referred paper("H. Karani, C. Huber, Physical Review E, 91(2)(2015) 023304"), a total heat flux continuity condition for conjugate heat transfer problems with moving interfaces was proposed. The authors asserted both conductive and advective heat fluxes are conserved simultaneously in their formulation. This condition had been cited by many subsequent studies. However, it is found that the total heat flux continuity condition violates Galilean invariance. The original diffusion heat flux continuity condition is reasonable for both stationary and moving interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian meshfree model for solidification of liquid thin-films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a new method to model solidification of thin liquid films is proposed. \blue{This method is targeted at applications like aircraft icing and tablet coating where the formation of liquid films from impinging droplets on a surface form a critical part of the physics of the process.} The proposed model takes into account the (i) unsteadiness in temperature distribution, (ii) heat transfer at the interface between the solid and the surface, (iii) volumetric expansion/contraction and (iv) the liquid thin-film behaviour, each of which are either partly or fully ignored in existing models. The liquid thin-film, modeled using the Discrete Droplet Method (DDM), is represented as a collection of discrete droplets that are tracked in a Lagrangian sense. The height of the liquid film is estimated as a summation of Gaussian kernel functions associated with each droplet. At each droplet location, a solid height is also computed. The evolution of the solid height is governed by the Stefan problem. The flow of the liquid thin-film is solved just as in the case of DDM, while also taking into consideration the shape of the solidified region lying beneath the droplet. The results presented in this work show the reliability of the proposed model in simulating solidification of thin-films and its applicability to complex problems such as ice-formation on aircraft wings. The model has been verified for canonical problems that have analytical solutions. For the more complex problems of icing, the results of the model are compared with data from literature, without considering a background air flow. The comparison can be improved by coupling this model with suitable air flow solvers, as shown in the final test case.</description>

      <title>Vibrational ADAPT-VQE: Critical points leads to problematic convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is one of the most promising applications for which quantum computing is expected to have significant impact. Despite considerable research in the field of electronic structure, calculating the vibrational properties of molecules on quantum computers remain a relatively unexplored field. In this work, we develop a vibrational ADAPT-VQE (vADAPT-VQE) formalism based on an infinite product representation (IPR) of anti-Hermitian excitation operators of the Full Vibrational Configuration Interaction (FVCI) wavefunction which allows for preparing eigenstates of vibrational Hamiltonians on quantum computers. In order to establish the vADAPT- VQE algorithm using the IPR, we study the exactness of disentangled Unitary Vibrational Coupled Cluster (dUVCC) theory and show that dUVCC can formally represent the FVCI wavefunction in an infinite expansion. To investigate the performance of the vADAPT-VQE algorithm, we numerically study whether the vADAPT-VQE algorithm generates a sequence of operators which may represent the FVCI wavefunction. Our numerical results indicate frequent appearance of critical points in the wavefunction preparation using vADAPT-VQE. These results imply that one may encounter diminishing usefulness when preparing vibrational wavefunctions on quantum computers using vADAPT-VQE and that additional studies are required to find methods that can circumvent this behavior.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Crank-Nicolson and Method of Lines for the Solution of Initial Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve Initial Value Problems with the Implicit Crank-Nicolson and the Method of Lines evolution schemes. The unknown functions use a spectral decomposition with the Fourier basis. The examples developed to illustrate the implementation are the advection equation, the wave equation written as a first order system of coupled equations and the viscous Burgers equation as a non-linear case. The problems are solved using: i) standard Finite Differences as the solution to compare with, ii) the State Vector Formalism (SVF), and iii) the Sampling Error Formalism (SEF). Our results for these equations show that the SVF provides convergent solutions whereas those constructed with the SEF are not consistent with the increase of resolution. Byproducts of our implementation include the construction of cost functions for the two evolution schemes and an efficient method to simulate the SVF and SEF in classical computers.</description>

      <title>Propensity of water self-ions at air(oil)-water interfaces revealed by deep potential molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) near air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics based on state-of-the-art neural network potentials with M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and hydroxide ions at air/oil-water interfaces, which can simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these ions, recombination of ions, and ionic distribution along the normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi collective variables. The results support a stable ionic double-layer distribution near the interface for both air-water and oil-water interface systems. Hydronium tends to reside in the topmost layer of the interface, while hydroxide with a slightly stronger interfacial stabilization free energy is enriched in the deeper interfacial layer. This double-layer distribution may help to understand the longstanding controversy about the interfacial acid-base nature.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on protein kinases and their inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common wisdom says that the entanglement of fermionic systems can be low in the second quantization formalism but is extremely large in the first quantization. Hence Matrix Product State (MPS) methods based on moderate entanglement have been overwhelmingly formulated in second quantization. Here we introduce a first-quantized MPS approach to simulate quantum many-body systems. We show that by reformulating the way the fermionic anti-symmetry is handled, we arrive at MPS with a level of entanglement comparable to the usual one found in second quantization. We demonstrate our scheme on the one-dimensional $t$-$V$ model (spinless fermions with nearest neighbour density-density interaction) for both ground state and time evolution. For time evolution, we find that the entanglement entropy in first quantization is significantly smaller than in its second quantization counterpart.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: IV. Connection of Fine-Grained and Coarse-Grained Dynamics with the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>

      <title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm^3 on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a ''universal MLFF'' capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>

      <title>From latent dynamics to meaningful representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While representation learning has been central to the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a key problem remains in making the learned representations meaningful. For this, the typical approach is to regularize the learned representation through prior probability distributions. However, such priors are usually unavailable or are ad hoc. To deal with this, recent efforts have shifted towards leveraging the insights from physical principles to guide the learning process. In this spirit, we propose a purely dynamics-constrained representation learning framework. Instead of relying on predefined probabilities, we restrict the latent representation to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics with a learnable transition density - a prior driven by statistical mechanics. We show this is a more natural constraint for representation learning in stochastic dynamical systems, with the crucial ability to uniquely identify the ground truth representation. We validate our framework for different systems including a real-world fluorescent DNA movie dataset. We show that our algorithm can uniquely identify orthogonal, isometric and meaningful latent representations.</description>

Abstract: This work presents the PORTALS framework, which leverages surrogate modeling and optimization techniques to enable the prediction of core plasma profiles and performance with nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations at significantly reduced cost, with no loss of accuracy. The efficiency of PORTALS is benchmarked against standard methods, and its full potential is demonstrated on a unique, simultaneous 5-channel (electron temperature, ion temperature, electron density, impurity density and angular rotation) prediction of steady-state profiles in a DIII-D ITER Similar Shape plasma with GPU-accelerated, nonlinear CGYRO. This paper also provides general guidelines for accurate performance predictions in burning plasmas and the impact of transport modeling in fusion pilot plants studies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive hybrid density functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact exchange contributions are known to crucially affect electronic states, which in turn govern covalent bond formation and breaking in chemical species. Empirically averaging the exact exchange admixture over compositional degrees of freedom, hybrid density functional approximations have been widely successful, yet have fallen short to reach high level quantum chemistry accuracy, primarily due to delocalization errors. We propose to `adaptify` hybrid functionals by generating optimal admixture ratios of exact exchange on the fly, i.e. specifically for any chemical compound, using extremely data efficient quantum machine learning models that carry negligible overhead. The adaptive Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof based hybrid density functional (aPBE0) is shown to yield atomization energies with sufficient accuracy to effectively cure the infamous spin gap problem in open shell systems, such as carbenes. aPBE0 further improves energetics, electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in organic molecules drawn from the QM9 and QM7b data set. Obtained with aPBE0 in a large basis, we present a revision of the entire QM9 data set (revQM9) with an estimated quality vastly superior to the original containing on average, stronger covalent binding, larger band-gaps, more localized electron densities, and larger dipole-moments. While aPBE0 is applicable in the equilibrium regime, outstanding limitations include covalent bond dissociation when going beyond the Coulson-Fisher point.</description>
