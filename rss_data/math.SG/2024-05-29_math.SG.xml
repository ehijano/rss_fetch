      <title>Cyclotomic Structures in Symplectic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Cohen-Jones-Segal construction of stable homotopy types associated to flow categories of Morse-Smale functions $f$ to the setting where $f$ is equivariant under a finite group action and is Morse but no longer Morse-Smale. This setting occurs universally, as equivariant Morse functions can rarely be perturbed to nearby equivariant Morse-Smale functions. The method is very general, and allows one to do equivariant Floer theory while avoiding all the complications typically caused by issues of equivariant transversality. The construction assigns a (genuine) equivariant orthogonal spectrum to an equivariant framed virtually smooth flow category. Using this method, we construct, for a compact symplectic manifold $M$, which is symplectically atoroidal with contact boundary, and is equipped with an equivariant trivialization of its polarization class, a cyclotomic structure on the spectral lift of the symplectic cohomology $SH^*(M)$. This generalizes a variant of the map which sends loops to their $p$-fold covers on free loop spaces to the setting of general Liouville domains, and suggests a systematic connection between Floer homology and $p$-adic Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Modified double brackets and a conjecture of S. Arthamonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 20 years ago, M. Van den Bergh introduced double Poisson brackets as operations on associative algebras inducing Poisson brackets under the representation functor. Weaker versions of these operations, called modified double Poisson brackets, were later introduced by S. Arthamonov in order to induce a Poisson bracket on moduli spaces of representations of the corresponding associative algebras. Moreover, he defined two operations that he conjectured to be modified double Poisson brackets. The first case of this conjecture was recently proved by M. Goncharov and V. Gubarev motivated by the theory of Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight. We settle the conjecture by realising the second case as part of a new family of modified double Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Unramified Gromov-Witten and Gopakumar-Vafa invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kim, Kresch and Oh defined unramified Gromov-Witten invariants. For a threefold, Pandharipande conjectured that they are equal to Gopakumar-Vafa invariants (BPS invariants) in the case of Fano classes and primitive Calabi-Yau classes. We prove the conjecture using a wall-crossing technique. This provides an algebro-geometric construction of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in these cases.</description>

      <title>To compute orientations of Morse flow trees in Legendrian contact homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:1704.05156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a closed, connected Legendrian submanifold of the 1-jet space of a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold. Associated to $\Lambda$ there is a Legendrian invariant called Legendrian contact homology, which is defined by counting rigid pseudo-holomorphic disks of $\Lambda$. Moreover, there exists a bijective correspondence between rigid pseudo-holomorphic disks and rigid Morse flow trees of $\Lambda$, which allows us to compute the Legendrian contact homology of $\Lambda$ via Morse theory.
  If $\Lambda$ is spin, then the moduli space of the rigid disks can be given a coherent orientation, so that the Legendrian contact homology of $\Lambda$ can be defined with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$. In this paper we give an algorithm for computing the corresponding orientation of the moduli space of rigid Morse flow trees if the dimension of $\Lambda $ is greater than 1, and up to 4 signs that depend on data that can be extracted from the vertices of the trees, but which are not given explicitly, in the case $n=1$.</description>

      <title>On contact mapping classes of prequantizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present examples of prequantizations over integral symplectic manifolds which admit infinitely many smoothly trivial contact mapping classes. These classes are given by the connected components of the strict contactomorphism group which project to the identity component of the symplectomorphism group of the base manifold. Along the way, we study the lifting problem of symplectomorphisms of the base manifold to strict contactomorphisms of the prequantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dualizability of sheaves on manifolds with isotropic singular supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda(M)$ and microsheaves with isotropic supports $\operatorname{\mu sh}_\Lambda(\Lambda)$ and obtain a classification result of colimit-preserving functors by convolutions of sheaf kernels. Moreover, for sheaves with isotropic singular supports and compact supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^b(M)_0$, the standard categorical duality and Verdier duality are related by the wrap-once functor, which is the inverse Serre functor in proper objects, and we thus show that the Verdier duality extends naturally to all compact objects $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^c(M)_0$ when the wrap-once functor is an equivalence, for instance, when $\Lambda$ is a full Legendrian stop or a swappable Legendrian stop.</description>

      <title>Tight contact structures on hyperbolic homology 3-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We produce a large class of hyperbolic homology 3-spheres admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures. We also produce a sub-class admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures within the same homotopy class of oriented plane distributions. As a corollary, we give a recipe to construct hyperbolic L-spaces admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures. We also introduce a notion of geometric limits of contact structures compatible with geometric limits of hyperbolic manifolds and study the behavior of the tight contact structures we construct under geometric limits.</description>
