      <title>Forall-Exists Relational Verification by Filtering to Forall-Forall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational verification encompasses research directions such as reasoning about data abstraction, reasoning about security and privacy, secure compilation, and functional specificaton of tensor programs, among others. Several relational Hoare logics exist, with accompanying tool support for compositional reasoning of $\forall\forall$ (2-safety) properties and, generally, k-safety properties of product programs. In contrast, few logics and tools exist for reasoning about $\forall\exists$ properties which are critical in the context of nondeterminism.
  This paper's primary contribution is a methodology for verifying a $\forall\exists$ judgment by way of a novel filter-adequacy transformation. This transformation adds assertions to a product program in such a way that the desired $\forall\exists$ property (of a pair of underlying unary programs) is implied by a $\forall\forall$ property of the transformed product. The paper develops a program logic for the basic $\forall\exists$ judgement extended with assertion failures; develops bicoms, a form of product programs that represents pairs of executions and that caters for direct translation of $\forall\forall$ properties to unary correctness; proves (using the logic) a soundness theorem that says successful $\forall\forall$ verification of a transformed bicom implies the $\forall\exists$ spec for its underlying unary commands; and implements a proof of principle prototype for auto-active relational verification which has been used to verify all examples in the paper. The methodology thereby enables a user to work with ordinary assertions and assumptions, and a standard assertion language, so that existing tools including auto-active verifiers can be used.</description>

      <title>Higher order differential calculus in mathlib</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the higher-order differential calculus library developed inside the Lean mathematical library mathlib. To support a broad range of applications, we depart in several ways from standard textbook definitions: we allow arbitrary fields of scalars, we work with functions defined on domains rather than full spaces, and we integrate analytic functions in the broader scale of smooth functions. These generalizations introduce significant challenges, which we address from both the mathematical and the formalization perspectives.</description>

      <title>Subvarieties of pointed Abelian l-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete classification of the subvarieties and subquasivarieties of pointed Abelian lattice-ordered groups ($\ell$-groups) that are generated by chains. We present two complementary approaches to achieve this classification.
  First, using purely $\ell$-group-theoretic methods, we analyze the structure of lexicographic products and radicals to identify all join-irreducible members of the lattice of subvarieties of positively pointed $\ell$-groups. We provide a novel equational basis for each of these subvarieties, leading to a complete description of the entire subvariety lattice. As a direct application, our $\ell$-group-theoretic classification yields an alternative, self-contained proof of Komori's celebrated classification of subvarieties of MV-algebras.
  Second, we explore the connection to MV-algebras via Mundici's $\Gamma$ functor. We prove that this functor preserves universal classes, a result of independent model-theoretic interest. This allows us to lift the classification of universal classes of MV-chains, due to Gispert, to a complete classification of universal classes of totally ordered pointed Abelian $\ell$-groups. As a direct consequence, we obtain a full description of the corresponding lattice of subquasivarieties. These results offer a comprehensive structural understanding of one of the most fundamental classes of ordered algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Partializations of Markov categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work develops a construction of a CD category of partial kernels from a particular type of Markov category called a partializable Markov category. These are a generalization of earlier models of categories of partial morphisms such as p-categories, dominical categories, restriction categories, etc. to a non-deterministic/non-cartesian setting. Here all morphisms are quasi-total, with a natural poset enrichment corresponding to one morphism being a restriction of the other. Furthermore, various properties important to categorical probability are preserved, such as positivity, representability, conditionals, Kolmogorov products, and splittings of idempotents. We additionally discuss an alternative notion of Kolmogorov product suitable for partial maps, as well as partial algebras for probability monads.
  The primary example is that of the partialization of the category of standard Borel spaces and Markov kernels. Other examples include variants where the distributions are finitely supported, or where one considers multivalued maps instead.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Exponentiation in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two seemingly different definitions of constructive ordinal exponentiation, where an ordinal is taken to be a transitive, extensional, and wellfounded order on a set. The first definition is abstract, uses suprema of ordinals, and is solely motivated by the expected equations. The second is more concrete, based on decreasing lists, and can be seen as a constructive version of a classical construction by Sierpi{\'n}ski based on functions with finite support. We show that our two approaches are equivalent (whenever it makes sense to ask the question), and use this equivalence to prove algebraic laws and decidability properties of the exponential. Our work takes place in the framework of homotopy type theory, and all results are formalized in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>Initial Algebra Correspondence under Reachability Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suitable reachability conditions can make two different fixed point semantics of a transition system coincide. For instance, the total and partial expected reward semantics on Markov chains (MCs) coincide whenever the MC at hand is almost surely reachable. In this paper, we present a unifying framework for such reachability conditions that ensures the correspondence of two different semantics. Our categorical framework naturally induces an abstract reachability condition via a suitable adjunction, which allows us to prove coincidences of fixed points, and more generally of initial algebras. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by instantiating several examples, including the almost surely reachability condition for MCs, and the unambiguity condition of automata. We further study a canonical construction of our instance for Markov decision processes by pointwise Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>A LOCAL View of the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend classical methods of computational complexity to the realm of distributed computing, where they sometimes prove more effective than in their original context. Our focus is on decision problems in the LOCAL model, a setting in which networked computers use synchronous message passing to collectively answer questions about their network topology. We impose two time constraints on this model: the number of communication rounds is bounded by a constant, and the number of computation steps of each computer is polynomially bounded in the size of its local input and received messages.
  By letting two players alternately assign certificates to all computers, we obtain a distributed generalization of the polynomial hierarchy (and thus of the complexity classes $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{NP}$). We then extend key results of complexity theory to this setting, including the Cook-Levin theorem (which identifies Boolean satisfiability as a complete problem for $\mathbf{NP}$) and Fagin's theorem (which characterizes $\mathbf{NP}$ as the class of problems expressible in existential second-order logic). The original results can be recovered as the special case where the network consists of a single computer.
  But perhaps more surprisingly, separating complexity classes becomes easier in the distributed setting: we can show that our hierarchy is infinite, while it remains notoriously open whether the same holds when restricted to a single computer. (By contrast, a collapse of our hierarchy would have implied a collapse of the classical polynomial hierarchy.)
  As an application, we propose quantifier alternation as a new tool for measuring the locality of problems in distributed computing.</description>

      <title>CFaults: Model-Based Diagnosis for Fault Localization in C Programs with Multiple Test Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development. Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults.
  This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Skills: Reasoning about Knowledge and Oblivion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a class of epistemic logics that captures the dynamics of acquiring knowledge and descending into oblivion, while incorporating concepts of group knowledge. The approach is grounded in a system of weighted models, introducing an ``epistemic skills'' metric to represent the epistemic capacities tied to knowledge updates. Within this framework, knowledge acquisition is modeled as a process of upskilling, whereas oblivion is represented as a consequence of downskilling. The framework further enables exploration of ``knowability'' and ``forgettability,'' defined as the potential to gain knowledge through upskilling and to lapse into oblivion through downskilling, respectively. Additionally, it supports a detailed analysis of the distinctions between epistemic de re and de dicto expressions. The computational complexity of the model checking and satisfiability problems is examined, offering insights into their theoretical foundations and practical implications.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Functional Interpretation with Informative Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a new approach to functional interpretations based on uniform quantification and relativization. The uniform quantification in the background permits a more penetrating analysis of principles related to collection and contra-collection. Relativization comes from a computationally informative notion of being an element of a given type. The approach is flexible. When the information takes the shape of bounds, we can recapture a form of the combination of G\"odel's functional dialectica interpretation with majorizability. When the information is "canonical" in function types, we obtain new functional interpretations and new models of G\"odel's theory T.</description>
