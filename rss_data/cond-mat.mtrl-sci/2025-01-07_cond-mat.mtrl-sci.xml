      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02070v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</description>

      <title>ALADYN: a set of Anharmonic LAttice DYNamics codes to compute thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a lattice dynamics package which calculates elastic, thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline materials from data on their force and potential energy as a function of atomic positions. The data can come from density functional theory (DFT) calculations or classical molecular dynamics runs performed in a supercell. First, the model potential parameters, which are anharmonic force constants are extracted from the latter runs. Then, once the anharmonic model is defined, thermal conductivity and equilibrium properties at finite temperatures can be computed using lattice dynamics, Boltzmann transport theories, and a variational principle respectively. In addition, the software calculates the mechanical properties such as elastic tensor, Gruneisen parameters and the thermal expansion coefficient within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Phonons, elastic constants and thermodynamic properties results applied to the germanium crystal will be illustrated. Using the force constants as a force field, one may also perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to investigate the combined effects of anharmonicity and defect scattering beyond perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against three generative models: a variational autoencoder, a large language model, and a diffusion model. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability rate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.</description>

      <title>First principles phase diagram calculation and theoretical investigation of electronic structure properties of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ for photocathode applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-throughput studies of copper-based semiconductors have identified potassium-based copper chalcogenides, KCuA (A $\in$ Te, Se, S) as optimal light absorbers in photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical devices. In this work, we investigate the applicability of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ as photocathode materials using first-principles calculations. The calculated temperature-composition phase diagram predicts the formation of the solid solution of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ in the hexagonal structure beyond a maximum critical temperature of 322 K. Structure relaxation in the alloy competes with volume deformation of the parent lattice and charge exchange between (Te, Se) anions to produce a net linear variation in the bandgap with the alloy concentration. The following results suggest that this alloy is a suitable photocathode: i) lower effective mass, and hence a higher mobility of electrons in the alloy compared to the end compounds, ii) an absorption coefficient of the order of $\mathrm{10^{5}\ cm^{-1}}$, and iii) an appropriate alignment of the conduction band with respect to the hydrogen reduction reaction.</description>

      <title>Monolayer control of spin-charge conversion in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diversity of 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) stacking presents a fertile ground for engineering novel multifunctional materials and quantum states of matter. This permits unique opportunities to tailor the electronic properties of vdW heterostructures by the insertion of only a single 2D material layer. However, such vdW materials engineering at the atomic scale has yet to be investigated for spin-charge interconversion phenomena. Here, we report on the control of these effects at the monolayer level, where drastic increase in intensity and change in sign of THz spintronic emission are demonstrated by inserting a single layer of MoSe$_2$ between PtSe$_2$ and graphene in a fully epitaxial, large area stacked structure. By using a combination of spin and angle resolved photoemission and density functional theory to reveal the electronic and spin structures, we illustrate two different mechanisms relying on charge transfer and electronic hybridization for the formation of Rashba states, which are responsible for spin-charge conversion and hence the THz spintronic emission. These findings open new pathways to design, at the atomic scale, efficient THz spintronic emitters made of 2D materials and other spintronic devices based on spin-charge interconversion phenomena.</description>

      <title>Efficient periodic density functional theory calculations of charged molecules and surfaces using Coulomb kernel truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of charged molecules and surfaces are critical to applications in electro-catalysis, energy materials and related fields of materials science. DFT implementations such as the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) compute the electrostatic potential under 3D periodic boundary conditions, necessitating charge neutrality. In this work, we implement 0D and 2D periodic boundary conditions to facilitate DFT calculations of charged molecules and surfaces respectively. We implement these boundary conditions using the Coulomb kernel truncation method. Our implementation computes the potential under 0D and 2D boundary conditions by selectively subtracting unwanted long-range interactions in the potential computed under 3D boundary conditions. By combining the Coulomb kernel truncation method with a computationally efficient padding approach, we remove nonphysical potentials from vacuum in 0D and 2D systems. To illustrate the computational efficiency of our method, we perform large supercell calculations of the formation energy of a charged chlorine defect on a sodium chloride (001) surface and perform long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations on a stepped gold (211) | water electrode-electrolyte interface.</description>

      <title>Materials Discovery in Combinatorial and High-throughput Synthesis and Processing: A New Frontier for SPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput, which are characteristically inherent to SPM. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.</description>

      <title>Orbital Order Triggered Out-of-Plane Ferroelectricity in Magnetic Transition Metal di-halide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although multiferroics have undergone extensive examination for several decades, the occurrence of ferroelectricity induced by orbital order is only scarcely documented. In this study, we propose the existence of spontaneous ferroelectric states featuring a finite out-of-plane polarization in monolayer compounds of magnetic transition metal di-halides. Our first principles analysis reveals that partially occupied d-orbital states within octahedra exhibit a preference for spatial orbital order within a two-dimensional lattice. The absence of inversion symmetry, arising from orbital order, serves as the driving force introducing additional electric polarization along the out-of-plane direction. Unlike previous reported orbital orders arising from metal states in lattice, the non-colinear ones we studied in this work relate to the transition between two insulator states. The resultant asymmetric Jahn-Teller distortions are accompanied as the consequence producing additional ionic polarization. Importantly, our findings indicate that this mechanism is not confined to a specific material but is a shared characteristic among a series of monolayer transition metal magnetic di-halides, proposing an innovative form of intrinsic two-dimensional multiferroic physics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic ordering with spin reorientation transition and optical properties in DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02544v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative study on radiation resistance of WTaCrV high-entropy alloy and tungsten in helium-containing conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: W and W-based high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising candidates for plasma-facing materials in fusion reactors. While irradiation studies on W have revealed a tendency for helium (He) bubble formation and radiation-induced defects, investigations of WTaCrV HEA have demonstrated superior radiation resistance, whether under He+ irradiation or heavy ion irradiation. To assess material performance under conditions relevant to fusion reactors - characterized by fast neutrons and gas production from transmutation reactions - complex irradiation environments need to be modeled. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined defect evolution in W and equimolar WTaCrV HEA with and without preexisting He atoms under cascade overlap conditions up to 0.2 dpa at 300 K. In W, dislocation loops and large interstitial clusters formed readily, with increasing He content leading to higher dislocation densities and the formation of polygonal interstitial networks. In contrast, the WTaCrV alloy exhibited strong resistance to the formation of dislocation loops and large interstitial clusters but was more susceptible to the formation of bubbles at higher He concentrations. Bubble growth was driven by helium trapping at vacancy sites and the coalescence of smaller bubbles. Larger bubbles remained stable against cascade overlap, limiting further growth by coalescence.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent Electronic and Topological Properties in van der Waals Antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining first-principles calculations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, we study the stack-dependent behaviour of electronic and topological properties of layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Lateral shift of top septuple-layer greatly modify electronic properties, and even induce topological phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with $C=1$ and trivial magnetic insulators with $C=0$. The local energy minimum of ``incorrect" stacking order exhibits thickness-dependent topology opposite to the usual stacking order, which is attribute to relatively weakened interlayer Te-Te interaction in ``incorrect" stacking configuration. Our effective model analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved, and we also propose two optical setups that can effectively differentiate between different stacking configurations. Our findings underscores the nuanced and profound influence that interlayer sliding in magnetic topological materials can have on the macroscopic quantum states, opening new avenues for the design and engineering of topological quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original theory of phonon polariton is Huang's equation which is suitable for diatomic polar crystals only. We proposed a generalized Huang's equation without fitting parameters for phonon polariton in polyatomic polar crystals. We obtained the dispersions of phonon polariton in GaP (bulk), hBN (bulk and 2D), {\alpha}-MoO3 (bulk and 2D) and ZnTeMoO6 (2D), which agree with the experimental results in the literature and of ourselves. We also obtained the eigenstates of the phonon polariton. We found that the circular polarization of the ion vibration component of these eigenstates is nonzero in hBN flakes. The result is different from that of the phonon in hBN.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Giant Magnetic Chirality during Dimensionality Crossover of Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, an intrinsic preference for a specific handedness, is a fundamental characteristic observed in nature. In magnetism, magnetic chirality arises from the anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in competition with the symmetric Heisenberg exchange interaction. Traditionally, the anti-symmetric interaction has been considered minor relative to the symmetric interaction. In this study, we demonstrate an observation of giant magnetic chirality during the dimensionality crossover of magnetic materials from three-dimensional to two-dimensional. The ratio between the anti-symmetric and symmetric interactions exhibits a reversal in their dominance over this crossover, overturning the traditional consideration. This observation is validated theoretically using a non-local interaction model and tight-binding calculation with distinct pairing schemes for each exchange interaction throughout the crossover. Additional experiments investigating the asphericity of orbital moments corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in shaping magnetic chirality and offer strategies for engineering chiral magnet states with unprecedented strength, desired for the design of spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Polarization-induced Quantum Spin Hall Insulator and Topological Devices in InAs Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we predict the emergence of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in conventional semiconductors, specifically InAs quantum wells, driven by a built-in polarization field. We propose QSHI InAs quantum wells as a platform to engineer topological field effect devices. More precisely, we first present a novel topological logic device that operates without a topological phase transition. Subsequently, we design a high-performance topological transistor due to the presence of edge states. Our approach provides a potential framework for harnessing the unique features of QSHI in device design, paving the way for future topological devices.</description>

      <title>Supertetragonal BaSnO3 induced giant ferroelectricity in SrTiO3/BaSnO3 superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite BaSnO3 has an Sn s-orbital conduction band minimum, which makes it of interest as a transparent-conducting oxide parent compound but also contraindicates the ferroelectric instability characteristic of the related compound BaTiO3. In this work, we studied the effect of (001) compressive strain on BaSnO3 using first-principles methods. We found that, with low compressive strain, symmetry breaking takes cubic BaSnO3 to a nonpolar tetragonal state, with a first-order phase transition to a hidden highly-polarized ferroelectric supertetragonal state at about -5%. Based on the facts that the mismatch of lattice constant in experiment between BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 is about -5.2% and coherent growth of BaSnO3 on SrTiO3 has been experimentally realized for BaSnO3 layers thinner than 3 unit-cells, we studied a series of SrTiO3/BaSnO3 superlattices with one or two unit-cells of BaSnO3 and several unit-cells of SrTiO3. We found that the superlattices are ferroelectric with large polarizations. We propose that the origin of ferroelectricity in the superlattices is the mechanical and electrical coupling of the BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 layers, with polarized supertetragonal state of BaSnO3 induced by compressive-strain from the SrTiO3 layers and polarization of the SrTiO3 layers by the polar BaSnO3 layers. Due to the distinctive electronic states in the BaSnO3 layers, the realization of ferroelectricity holds promise for the design of novel electronic devices.</description>

      <title>BaTiO$_3$ -- SrTiO$_3$ composites: a microscopic study on paraelectric cubic inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.</description>

      <title>The importance of shear on the collective charge transport in CDWs revealed by an XFEL source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transport in materials has an impact on a wide range of devices based on semiconductor, battery or superconductor technology. Charge transport in sliding Charge Density Waves (CDW) differs from all others in that the atomic lattice is directly involved in the transport process. To obtain an overall picture of the structural changes associated to the collective transport, the large coherent X-ray beam generated by an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) source was used. The CDW phase can be retrieved over the entire sample from diffracted intensities using a genetic algorithm. For currents below threshold, increasing shear deformation is observed in the central part of the sample while longitudinal deformation appears above threshold when shear relaxes. Shear thus precedes longitudinal deformation, with relaxation of one leading to the appearance of the other. Moreover, strain accumulates on surface steps in the sliding regime, demonstrating the strong pinning character of these surface discontinuities. The sliding process of nanometric CDW is based on an impressive spatial coherence involving the macroscopic sample dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic spin-splitting multiferroic antiferromagnet and compensated ferrimagnet with zero net magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-splitting antiferromagnets with spin-polarized band structures in momentum space have garnered intensive research attention due to their zero net magnetic moments, ultras fast spin dynamics as conventional antiferromagnets, and spin-polarized transport properties akin to ferromagnets, making them promising candidates for antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, unlike spin-torque switching of ferromagnets by electric current, efficient electric control of spin-splitting antiferromagnetic order remains challenges. In this work, we identify prototypes of multiferroic spin-splitting antiferromagnets, including BiFeO3, Fe2Mo3O8 and compensated ferrimagnet GaFeO3 with ferroelectric polarization as well as spin-polarized electronic structures. We establish design principles for the spin-splitting multiferroic antiferromagnets and compensated ferrimagnets, elucidating the band symmetry features in Brillouin zone. We demonstrate that the spin polarization in spin-splitting magnets, despite of zero net magnetic moment, can be switched by ferroelectric polarization, providing an efficient means of controlling the antiferromagnetic order. Our work may inspire future development of novel multiferroic functional magnets with zero magnetic moments and pave the way for their applications in magnetoelectric spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Predicting band gap from chemical composition: A simple learned model for a material property with atypical statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid-state materials science, substantial efforts have been devoted to the calculation and modeling of the electronic band gap. While a wide range of ab initio methods and machine learning algorithms have been created that can predict this quantity, the development of new computational approaches for studying the band gap remains an active area of research. Here we introduce a simple machine learning model for predicting the band gap using only the chemical composition of the crystalline material. To motivate the form of the model, we first analyze the empirical distribution of the band gap, which sheds new light on its atypical statistics. Specifically, our analysis enables us to frame band gap prediction as a task of modeling a mixed random variable, and we design our model accordingly. Our model formulation incorporates thematic ideas from chemical heuristic models for other material properties in a manner that is suited towards the band gap modeling task. The model has exactly one parameter corresponding to each element, which is fit using data. To predict the band gap for a given material, the model computes a weighted average of the parameters associated with its constituent elements and then takes the maximum of this quantity and zero. The model provides heuristic chemical interpretability by intuitively capturing the associations between the band gap and individual chemical elements.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond temperature measurements of laser-shocked copper deduced from the intensity of the x-ray thermal diffuse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 50-fs, single-shot measurements of the x-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) from copper foils that have been shocked via nanosecond laser-ablation up to pressures above 135~GPa. We hence deduce the x-ray Debye-Waller (DW) factor, providing a temperature measurement. The targets were laser-shocked with the DiPOLE 100-X laser at the High Energy Density (HED) endstation of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL). Single x-ray pulses, with a photon energy of 18 keV, were scattered from the samples and recorded on Varex detectors. Despite the targets being highly textured (as evinced by large variations in the elastic scattering), and with such texture changing upon compression, the absolute intensity of the azimuthally averaged inelastic TDS between the Bragg peaks is largely insensitive to these changes, and, allowing for both Compton scattering and the low-level scattering from a sacrificial ablator layer, provides a reliable measurement of $T/\Theta_D^2$, where $\Theta_D$ is the Debye temperature. We compare our results with the predictions of the SESAME 3336 and LEOS 290 equations of state for copper, and find good agreement within experimental errors. We thus demonstrate that single-shot temperature measurements of dynamically compressed materials can be made via thermal diffuse scattering of XFEL radation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of our efforts to develop hydrogen gas sensors, two samples of ternary CuWO4 with the same crystalline structure have been prepared by two different non-equilibrium techniques. We show that the materials' structure is significantly different from the known stable one, and we identify that it is very similar to that of previously reported {\gamma}-CuMoO4. We use ab initio calculations to confirm that the newly identified phase, {\gamma}-CuWO4, represents a local energy minimum. We present very similar calculated and measured lattice constants and X-ray diffractograms. We make a case that the low-temperature formation of the metastable {\gamma}-CuWO4 phase is facilitated by easier kinetics and/or by Cu-rich composition of our samples, and we show that it converts to the stable phase after annealing to 600 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Finite-Temperature Real-time Time Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculation with Hybrid Functional on ARM and GPU Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast electronic phenomena originating from finite temperature, such as nonlinear optical excitation, can be simulated with high fidelity via real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations with hybrid functional. However, previous rt-TDDFT simulations of real materials using the optimal gauge--known as the parallel transport gauge--have been limited to low-temperature systems with band gaps. In this paper, we introduce the parallel transport-implicit midpoint (PT-IM) method, which significantly accelerates finite-temperature rt-TDDFT calculations of real materials with hybrid function. We first implement PT-IM with hybrid functional in our plane wave code PWDFT, and optimized it on both GPU and ARM platforms to build a solid baseline code. Next, we propose a diagonalization method to reduce computation and communication complexity, and then, we employ adaptively compressed exchange (ACE) method to reduce the frequency of the most expensive Fock exchange operator. Finally, we adopt the ring\_based method and the shared memory mechanism to overlap computation and communication and alleviate memory consumption respectively. Numerical results show that our optimized code can reach 3072 atoms for rt-TDDFT simulation with hybrid functional at finite temperature on 192 computing nodes, the time-to-solution for one time step is 429.3s, which is 41.4 times faster compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Synthetic accessibility and sodium ion conductivity of the Na$_{8-x}$A$^{x}$P$_2$O$_9$ (NAP) high-temperature sodium superionic conductor framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancement of solid state electrolytes (SSEs) for all solid state batteries typically focuses on modification of a parent structural framework for improved conductivity, \textit{e.g.} cation substitution for an immobile ion or varying the concentration of the mobile ion. Therefore, novel frameworks can be disruptive by enabling fast ion conduction aided by different structure and diffusion mechanisms, and unlocking optimal conductors with different properties (\textit{e.g.} mechanical properties, sintering needs, electrochemical stability) than previously published. Herein, we perform a high throughput survey of an understudied structural framework for sodium ion conduction, Na$_{8-x}$A$^x$P$_2$O$_9$ (NAP), to understand the family's thermodynamic stability, synthesizability, and ionic conduction. We first show that the parent phase Na$_4$TiP$_2$O$_9$ (NTP) undergoes a structural distortion (with accompanying conductivity transition) due to unstable phonons from a pseduo-Jahn Teller mode in the 1D titanium chains. Then, screening of cation-substituted structural candidates with \textit{ab initio} and machine-learned potential calculations reveal a number of candidates that are thermodynamically stable, likely synthesizable, and have high predicted ionic conductivities. High throughput experimental trials and subsequent methodology optimization of one Na$_4$SnP$_2$O$_9$ (NSP) highlight collective challenges to the synthesis pathways for sodium phosphate materials via solid state synthesis. Our results demonstrate that NAP is a highly tunable conduction framework whose high temperature conductivity transition has heretofore eliminated it from significant research interest. By expanding the structural toolkit for SSE design, we increase the number of useful sodium ion electrolytes for integration into safe and accessible solid state batteries.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Plant Protein Microcapsules for Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Cargo Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscale hydrogels comprised of macromolecular networks have increasingly been used for applications involving cell encapsulation, tissue engineering and for the storage and release of active cargo molecules. However, the majority of such microgels are formed from nonbiodegradable synthetic polymers, involving harmful solvents, or using animal proteins, such as silk and gelatin, which can have a negative environmental impact and lack sustainability. Furthermore, most encapsulation techniques involve either protecting hydrophobic or hydrophilic cargo, but rarely both. In order to address these issues, we employed droplet-microfluidics to develop novel, plant protein microcapsules capable of containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic cargo molecules. The microcapsule structure and cargo release rates were controlled by balancing osmotic pressures between the outer and inner phases of the capsules. Moreover, the digestibility of the microcapsules was comparable with that of pure pea protein, thereby enabling the use of these microcapsules for food and beverage applications. In addition, digestive enzymes can trigger the release of the encapsulated active ingredients, and hence, these microcapsules are well suited for the controlled delivery of active nutraceutical or pharmaceutical ingredients. Finally, we investigated the biodegradability of the microcapsules. It was determined that the plant protein microcapsules exhibited 98.0% biodegradability (as compared with cellulose), thereby fulfilling the biodegradability standards stipulated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14851) for microplastics in freshwater conditions (90%). Hence, the plant protein microcapsules can have numerous applications in the food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, personal care, and agriculture industries.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity Magnetism Driven by Antiferromagnetic Exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>

      <title>Active Learning Enables Extrapolation in Molecular Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although generative models hold promise for discovering molecules with optimized desired properties, they often fail to suggest synthesizable molecules that improve upon the known molecules seen in training. We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</description>

      <title>Topological insights into dense frictional suspension rheology: Third order loops drive discontinuous shear thickening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense suspensions exhibit significant viscosity changes under external deformation, a phenomenon known as shear thickening. Recent studies have identified a stress-induced transition from lubricated, unconstrained interactions to frictional contacts, which play a crucial role in shear thickening. This work investigates the rheological behavior and contact network evolution during continuous and discontinuous shear thickening (CST and DST) in two-dimensional simulations. We find that at low stress, during weak thickening, the frictional contact network is composed of quasilinear chains along the compression axis. With increasing stress, the contact network becomes more isotropic, and forms loop-like structures. We show that third-order loops within the frictional contact network are key to this behavior. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the number of edges in the third-order loops and the viscosity of the suspension. Notably, this relationship remains independent of the packing fraction, applied stress, and interparticle friction, highlighting the fundamental role of the mesoscale network topology in governing macroscopic rheology.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric AlScN thin films with enhanced polarization and low leakage enabled by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250{\deg}C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.</description>

      <title>Jamming transition and normal modes of polydispersed soft particle packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of soft particles characterized by narrow size distributions has been well studied by physicists. However, polydispersed systems are more relevant to engineering, and the influence of polydispersity on jamming phenomena is still unexplored. Here, we numerically investigate jamming transitions of polydispersed soft particles in two dimensions. We find that polydispersity strongly influences contact forces, local coordination, and the jamming transition density. In contrast, the critical scaling of pressure and elastic moduli is not affected by the particle size distribution. Consistent with this observation, we find that the vibrational density of states is also insensitive to the polydispersity. Our results suggest that, regardless of particle size distributions, both mechanical and vibrational properties of soft particle packings near jamming are governed by the distance to jamming.</description>

      <title>The underappreciated role of nonspecific interactions in the crystallization of DNA-coated colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the field of programmable self-assembly has seen an explosion in the diversity of crystal lattices that can be synthesized from DNA-coated colloidal nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles. The prevailing wisdom has been that a particular crystal structure can be targeted by designing the DNA-mediated interactions, to enforce binding between specific particle pairs, and the particle diameters, to control the packing of the various species. In this article, we show that other ubiquitous nonspecific interactions can play equally important roles in determining the relative stability of different crystal polymorphs and therefore what crystal structure is most likely to form in an experiment. For a binary mixture of same-sized DNA-coated colloidal micrometer-scale particles, we show how changing the magnitudes of nonspecific steric and van der Waals interactions gives rise to a family of binary body-centered tetragonal crystals, including both cesium-chloride and copper-gold crystals. Simulations using pair potentials that account for these interactions reproduce our experimental observations quantitatively, and a theoretical model reveals how a subtle balance between specific and nonspecific forces determines the equilibrium crystal structure. These results highlight the importance of accounting for nonspecific interactions in the crystal-engineering design process.</description>

      <title>Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been indicated that the path forward for the widespread usage of ferroelectric (FE) materials may be considerably facilitated through the reduction of programming voltages to on-chip logic compatible values of &lt; 1 V. Obstacles involve issues related to the scaling of the FEs to lower thickness as well as the presence of an interfacial layer (IL) between the high permittivity FE and the substrate -- resulting in wasted voltage across the IL. Here, we show how lower operating voltages along with a higher tunneling electroresistance (TER) could be achieved through IL engineering. We use piezoresponse force microscopy and fabricated ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) to show that ultra-thin FE films deposited on single layer graphene can exhibit polarization switching at ~ 0.8 V with significant TER.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Cation-Polyanion Coupling in Solid Electrolytes: Which Anion Motion Dominates Cation Transport?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.</description>

Abstract: In addition to enhanced fields and possible charge transfer, the concentration of photothermal energy at the nanoscale is a foundation of plasmon-driven photochemistry. We demonstrate a further enhancement of heat localization during the dissipation of energy in a bimetallic antenna--reactor system with palladium satellites attached to a gold nanoparticle. After pulsed excitation of the gold core, the satellites collect nearly all photothermal energy and heat up by 180\,K while the light-absorbing gold core remains much colder. By comparing transient absorption dynamics of a series of bimetallic nanoparticles with a three-temperature model, we can precisely assess the temperatures of the electronic and vibrational subsystems. We find a strong inverted temperature gradient that opposes the direction of energy input and concentrates the light energy at the active catalytic nanosite.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near the high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimised to maximise the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy, and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biology.</description>

      <title>Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02707v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>

      <title>Photo-luminescence properties of ion implanted Er3+-defects in 4H-SiCOI towards integrated quantum photonics</title>

Abstract: Colour centres hosted in solid-state materials such as silicon carbide and diamond are promising candidates for integration into chip-scale quantum systems. Specifically, the incorporation of these colour centres within photonic integrated circuits may enable precise control over their inherent photo-physical properties through strong light-matter interaction. Here, we investigate ion-implanted erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) defects embedded in thin-film 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI). Optimized implantation conditions and thermal annealing processes designed to enhance the emission characteristics of the $\text{Er}^{3+}$-defect are reported. By examining key properties such as photoluminescence intensity, optical lifetime, and polarization, we present an analysis of ensemble $\text{Er}^{3+}$-defects within 4H-SiCOI, providing insights into their potential for future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of exciton-polariton condensation under different pumping schemes for 1D and 2D microcavities including the effect of strong correlation between polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated polaritons are necessary for entering the quantum photonic regime with many applications. We simulate exciton-polariton condensation using the finite-difference and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods with the strongly correlated polariton condition incorporated in the mean-field equations and analyze the polariton dynamics. This is done for coherent, near-resonant pumping as well as homogeneous, incoherent, non-resonant pumping. We find conditions akin to the polariton blockade in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect in Centrosymmetric and Noncentrosymmetric Systems: Insights from Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range disorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform to study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs are naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a bias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal that slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant contribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its prominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic OHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband components vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric systems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to the extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal and off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in experimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly extrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of inversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding with significant implications for experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</description>

      <title>Universality in quantum critical flow of charge and heat in ultra-clean graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in quantum critical Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with a dc electrical conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, and thermodynamic variables such as the entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous flow of charge is frequently reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the value of $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, predicted to be quantized and determined only by the universality class of the critical point, has not been established experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical ($\sigma$) and thermal ($\kappa_\mathrm{e}$) conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that $\sigma$ and $\kappa_\mathrm{e}$ are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$ converges to $\approx (4\pm 1)\times e^2/h$ for multiple devices, where $e$ and $h$ are the electronic charge and the Planck's constant, respectively. We also observe, (1) a giant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law where the effective Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures, and (2) the effective dynamic viscosity ($\eta_\mathrm{th}$) in the thermal regime approaches the holographic limit $\eta_\mathrm{th}/s_\mathrm{th} \rightarrow \hbar/4\pi k_\mathrm{B}$ within a factor of four in the cleanest devices close to the room temperature, where $s_\mathrm{th}$ and $k_\mathrm{B}$ are the thermal entropy density and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Our experiment addresses the missing piece in the potential of high-quality graphene as a testing bed for some of the unifying concepts in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary compound FeGe hosts multiple structures, from cubic and hexagonal to monoclinic. Compared to the well-known skyrmion lattice in the cubic phase and the antiferromagnetic charge-density wave in the hexagonal phase, the monoclinic FeGe is less explored. Here, we synthesized the monoclinic FeGe films on Al2O3 (001) and studied their structural, magnetic, and transport properties. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that the FeGe films are epitaxial to the substrate. Unlike the antiferromagnetic bulk, the monoclinic FeGe films are ferromagnetic with Curie-temperature as high as ~ 800 K, contributing to the anomalous Hall effect in the transport measurements. Similar to the hexagonal FeGe, we captured a structural phase transition in the monoclinic FeGe films at ~ 100 K in real and reciprocal spaces by transmission electron microscope. Our work enriches the phase diagram of the FeGe family and suggests that FeGe offers an ideal platform for studying multiphase transitions and related device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chloride molten salts are increasingly used in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding thermodynamic properties of these salts is essential to predict their critical characteristics and optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), have been utilized in the literature to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor is used to guide the model selection process for thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl3 system and provide statistical comparison of various models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable one based on available data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl3 system has been further modelled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) using MQMQA with the thermodynamic properties of compounds in KCl-LaCl3 predicted by the quasiharmonic approach in terms of first-principles phonon calculations as a function of temperature. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate thermodynamic model is important for accurately predicting critical characteristics of complex molten salts.</description>

      <title>SemiEpi: Self-driving, Closed-loop Multi-Step Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>

Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.</description>

Abstract: The development of solid-state batteries (SSBs) is hindered by degradation at solid-solid interfaces due to void formation and contact loss, resulting in increased impedance. Here, we systematically investigate the roles of real and unrecoverable interfacial contact areas at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface in driving the impedance rise. By controlling contact geometries and applied pressures, we identify their distinct contributions to the impedance spectra and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and transport. Experiments reveal that interfacial resistance varies strongly with recoverable contact area and applied pressure following power law scaling, with exponents of -1 and -0.5, respectively. Moreover, distributed contacts result in lower impedance due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Continuum simulations of the contact geometries predict interfacial resistances in agreement with experiments. Our work highlights the influence of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses on SSB impedance while quantifying the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator and axion state in V2WS4</title>

Abstract: Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators offers an ideal platform to explore exotic topological phenomena, such as axion electrodynamics, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and Majorana edge modes. However, these emerging new physical effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of suitable materials. Here, we predict the van der Waals layered V$_2$WS$_4$ and its related materials show intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We find extremely rich magnetic topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films, respectively. Remarkably, the N\'eel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the topological quantum physics research and application.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in Moving Charge Density Waves</title>

Abstract: The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanoscale charged colloid crystallization near a metastable liquid binodal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Domain-Wall Ferroelectric Polarons in a two-dimensional Rotor Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of ferroelectric domain-wall polarons in a minimal two-dimensional lattice model of electrons interacting with rotating dipoles. Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions, causing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The rotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability in the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking process. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric polarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Unusually high-density 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Agnostic Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic-Crystal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures and to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Large tunable Josephson diode effect in a side-contacted topological-insulator-nanowire junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Luminescent Trityl-based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge-Resonance in Low-Lying Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicals and diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low-lying excited states by fine-tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM-derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on TTM-derived diradicals to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis focuses on a series of symmetric TTM-derived diradicals with singlet ground state, featuring radical moieties linked by pi-conjugated spacers of different length. The nature of the lowest excited electronic states that control their photophysical behaviour is discussed in detail. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM-TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The lowest excited states of the diradicals differ qualitatively from those of TTM: two novel low-lying states emerge in the diradical, due to charge resonance (CR) between the two radical units. The lowest CR state is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue-shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM-ph-TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM-derived diradicals</description>
