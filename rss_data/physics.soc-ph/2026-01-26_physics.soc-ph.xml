      <title>D-MODD: A Diffusion Model of Opinion Dynamics Derived from Online Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first empirical derivation of a continuous-time stochastic model for real-world opinion dynamics. Using longitudinal social-media data to infer users opinion on a binary climate-change topic, we reconstruct the underlying drift and diffusion functions governing individual opinion updates. We show that the observed dynamics are well described by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation, with persistent attractor basins and spatially sensitive drift and diffusion terms. The empirically inferred one-step transition probabilities closely reproduce the transition kernel generated from the D-MODD model we introduce. Our results provide the first direct evidence that online opinion dynamics on a polarized topic admit a Markovian description at the operator level, with empirically reconstructed transition kernels accurately reproduced by a data-driven Langevin model, bridging sociophysics, behavioral data, and complex-systems modeling.</description>

      <title>National Quantum Strategies: A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding the Quantum Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum technologies (QT) move from foundational research toward industrial and societal deployment, national strategies have become critical instruments for shaping the future of this emerging field. In this study, we conduct the first large-scale, data-driven analysis of 62 national quantum strategic documents (QSDs) from 20 countries. Using AI-based natural language processing (topic modeling), we identify 12 topics present in the text, ranging from technical development areas to transversal aspects such as workforce development and governance. Temporal analysis reveals a distinct shift in policy discourse toward applications of QT and commercialisation, and relatively away from basic science. Our findings highlight the increasing diversification of the QT field, and contribute to the growing area of quantum policy studies. We advocate for more AI and data-driven analyses of the quantum ecosystem, to work toward a scalable framework for understanding the technological and societal challenges of the second quantum revolution.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Dynamics of Reputation-Based Voluntary Prisoner's Dilemma Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation underlies many natural and artificial systems. While voluntary participation can sustain cooperation without informational assumptions, real interactions are rarely anonymous, leaving the joint effects of participation and reputation insufficiently understood. We propose a reputation-based voluntary Prisoner's Dilemma in which agents incur a monitoring cost to inspect opponents and decide whether to exit an interaction for a fixed incentive to avoid exploitation or to default to cooperation or defection. We show that reputation-conditioned exit generates multiple coexistence pathways that sustain cooperation across population structures. In well-mixed populations, cooperation persists through stable mixed coexistence, whereas in structured populations, exit-incentive-dependent regimes emerge, including local cyclic dominance and persistent oscillations. Together, these results extend voluntary participation frameworks and underscore the role of exit-incentive design in cooperative multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Segregation Before Polarization: How Recommendation Strategies Shape Echo Chamber Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms facilitate echo chambers through feedback loops between user preferences and recommendation algorithms. While algorithmic homogeneity is well-documented, the distinct evolutionary pathways driven by content-based versus link-based recommendations remain unclear. Using an extended dynamic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), we show that content-based algorithms--unlike their link-based counterparts--steer social networks toward a segregation-before-polarization (SbP) pathway. Along this trajectory, structural segregation precedes opinion divergence, accelerating individual isolation while delaying but ultimately intensifying collective polarization. Furthermore, we reveal a paradox in information sharing: Reposting increases the number of connections in the network, yet it simultaneously reinforces echo chambers because it amplifies small, latent opinion differences that would otherwise remain inconsequential. These findings suggest that mitigating polarization requires stage-dependent algorithmic interventions, shifting from content-centric to structure-centric strategies as networks evolve.</description>

      <title>Community Detection with the Map Equation and Infomap: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world networks have a complex topology comprising many elements often structured into communities. Revealing these communities helps researchers uncover the organizational and functional structure of the system that the network represents. However, detecting community structures in complex networks requires selecting a community detection method among a multitude of alternatives with different network representations, community interpretations, and underlying mechanisms. This tutorial focuses on a popular community detection method called the map equation and its search algorithm Infomap. The map equation framework for community detection describes communities by analyzing dynamic processes on the network. Thanks to its flexibility, the map equation provides extensions that can incorporate various assumptions about network structure and dynamics. To help decide if the map equation is a suitable community detection method for a given complex system and problem at hand - and which variant to choose - we review the map equation's theoretical framework and guide users in applying the map equation to various research problems.</description>

      <title>From motifs to L\'evy flights: Modeling urban mobility in Bogot\'a's public transport system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two years of access card validation records from Bogot\'a's multimodal public transport system, comprising over 2.3 billion trips across bus rapid transit, feeder buses, dual-service buses, and an aerial cable network. From user trajectories constructed exclusively from access records, we derive motifs that reveal recurrent mobility patterns extending beyond simple two-location visits. This approach enables the construction of an integrated origin-destination (OD) matrix covering 2,828 urban zones. Similarity analysis using the Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the temporal stability of mobility structures across semesters, despite infrastructure changes and fare policy adjustments. From the obtained OD matrices, we derive transition probabilities between zones and uncover a robust power-law relationship with geographical distance, consistent with L\'evy flight dynamics. We validate our model using Monte Carlo simulations showing that reproduces both local and long-range displacements, with similar scaling exponents across time. These findings demonstrate that Bogot\'a's public transport mobility can be effectively modeled through L\'evy processes, providing a novel framework for analyzing complex transportation systems based solely on user access records.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the impact of cross-order hyperdegree correlations in contagion processes on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contagion processes in social systems often involve interactions that go beyond pairwise contacts. Higher-order networks, represented as hypergraphs, have been widely used to model multi-body interactions, and their presence can drastically alter contagion dynamics compared to traditional network models. However, existing analytical approaches typically assume independence between pairwise and higher-order degrees, and thus study their roles in isolation. In this paper, we develop an effective hyperdegree model (EHDM) to describe Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics on hypergraphs that explicitly captures correlations between the distribution of groups with different sizes. Our effective hyperdegree model shows excellent agreement with stochastic simulations across different types of higher-order networks, including those with heterogeneous degree distributions. We explore the critical role of cross-order degree correlations, specifically, whether nodes that are hubs in pairwise interactions also serve as hubs in higher-order interactions. We show that positive correlation decreases the epidemic threshold and anti-correlation temporally desynchronizes infection pathways (pairwise and group interactions). Finally, we demonstrate that, depending on the level of correlation, the optimal control strategy shifts -- from one that is purely pairwise- or higher-order-focused to one in which a mixed strategy becomes optimal.</description>

      <title>Fluent but Foreign: Even Regional LLMs Lack Cultural Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used worldwide, yet exhibit Western cultural tendencies. Many countries are now building ``regional'' or ``sovereign'' LLMs, but it remains unclear whether they reflect local values and practices or merely speak local languages. Using India as a case study, we evaluate six Indic and six global LLMs on two dimensions -- values and practices -- grounded in nationally representative surveys and community-sourced QA datasets. Across tasks, Indic models do not align better with Indian norms than global models; in fact, a U.S. respondent is a closer proxy for Indian values than any Indic model. We further run a user study with 115 Indian users and find that writing suggestions from both global and Indic LLMs introduce Westernized or exoticized writing. Prompting and regional fine-tuning fail to recover alignment and can even degrade existing knowledge. We attribute this to scarce culturally grounded data, especially for pretraining. We position cultural evaluation as a first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offer a reusable, community-grounded methodology. We call for native, community-authored corpora and thickxwide evaluations to build truly sovereign LLMs.</description>

      <title>Sustainable, Local Socio-Economic Development Through Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomy, often perceived as a distant or luxury science, holds immense potential as a driver for sustainable local socio-economic development. This paper explores how astronomy can create tangible benefits for communities through education, tourism, technology transfer, and capacity building. Using case studies from South Africa, Chile, Indonesia, and India, we demonstrate how astronomical facilities and initiatives have stimulated local economies, generated employment, supported small enterprises, and enhanced STEM participation, while simultaneously inspiring a sense of shared global heritage. The analysis identifies both successes and challenges, including unequal benefit distribution, limited local ownership, and sustainability gaps once external funding ends. Building on these lessons, we propose a practical framework/guidelines for designing, implementing, and evaluating astronomy-based community initiatives, rooted in participatory engagement and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper positions astronomy as a catalyst for inclusive growth, demonstrating that investment in the cosmos can translate into grounded, measurable benefits for people and places on Earth.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term dynamic redundancy and mortality (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>
