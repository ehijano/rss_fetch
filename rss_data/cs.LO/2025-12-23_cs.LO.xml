      <title>A logic for default deontic reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-life settings, agents must navigate dynamic environments while reasoning under incomplete information and acting on a corpus of unstable, context-dependent, and often conflicting norms. We introduce a general, non-modal, proof-theoretic framework for deontic reasoning grounded in default logic. Its central feature is the notion of controlled sequent - a sequent annotated with sets of formulas (control sets) that prescribe what should or should not be entailed by the formulas in the antecedent. When combined with distinct extra-logical rules representing defaults and norms, these control sets record the conditions and constraints governing their applicability, thereby enabling local soundness checks for derived sequents. We prove that controlled sequent calculi satisfies admissibility of contraction and non-analytic cuts, and we establish their strong completeness with respect to credulous consequence in default theories and normative systems. Finally, we illustrate in depth how controlled sequent calculi provide a flexible and expressive basis for resolving deontic conflicts and capturing dynamic deontic notions via appropriate extra-logical rules.</description>

      <title>Modular Automatic Complexity Analysis of Recursive Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier work, we developed a modular approach for automatic complexity analysis of integer programs. However, these integer programs do not allow non-tail recursive calls or subprocedures. In this paper, we consider integer programs with function calls and present a natural extension of our modular complexity analysis approach to the recursive setting based on a new form of ranking functions. Hence, our approach combines already existing powerful techniques on the "imperative" parts of the program and our novel ranking functions on the recursive parts. The strength of this combination is demonstrated by our implementation in the complexity analysis tool KoAT.</description>

      <title>MSC-180: A Benchmark for Automated Formal Theorem Proving from Mathematical Subject Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a core research direction in artificial intelligence for achieving formal reasoning and verification, playing a significant role in advancing machine intelligence. However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>Neural Proofs for Sound Verification and Control of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This informal contribution presents an ongoing line of research that is pursuing a new approach to the construction of sound proofs for the formal verification and control of complex stochastic models of dynamical systems, of reactive programs and, more generally, of models of Cyber-Physical Systems. Neural proofs are made up of two key components: 1) proof rules encode requirements entailing the verification of general temporal specifications over the models of interest; and 2) certificates that discharge such rules, namely they are constructed from said proof rules with an inductive (that is, cyclic, repetitive) approach; this inductive approach involves: 2a) accessing samples from the model's dynamics and accordingly training neural networks, whilst 2b) generalising such networks via SAT-modulo-theory (SMT) queries that leverage the full knowledge of the models. In the context of sequential decision making problems over complex stochastic models, it is possible to additionally generate provably-correct policies/strategies/controllers, namely state-feedback functions that, in conjunction with neural certificates, formally attain the given specifications for the models of interest.</description>

      <title>A Logical View of GNN-Style Computation and the Role of Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the numerical and Boolean expressiveness of MPLang, a declarative language that captures the computation of graph neural networks (GNNs) through linear message passing and activation functions. We begin with A-MPLang, the fragment without activation functions, and give a characterization of its expressive power in terms of walk-summed features. For bounded activation functions, we show that (under mild conditions) all eventually constant activations yield the same expressive power - numerical and Boolean - and that it subsumes previously established logics for GNNs with eventually constant activation functions but without linear layers. Finally, we prove the first expressive separation between unbounded and bounded activations in the presence of linear layers: MPLang with ReLU is strictly more powerful for numerical queries than MPLang with eventually constant activation functions, e.g., truncated ReLU. This hinges on subtle interactions between linear aggregation and eventually constant non-linearities, and it establishes that GNNs using ReLU are more expressive than those restricted to eventually constant activations and linear layers.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of theories of semirings with fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we prove the undecidability (and $\Sigma^0_1$-completeness) of several theories of semirings with fixed points. The generality of our results stems from recursion theoretic methods, namely the technique of effective inseperability. Our result applies to many theories proposed in the literature, including Conway $\mu$-semirings, Park $\mu$-semirings, and Chomsky algebras.</description>

      <title>The Index and Core of a Relation. With Applications to the Axiomatics of Relation Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02017v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the general notions of an index and a core of a relation. We postulate a limited form of the axiom of choice -- specifically that all partial equivalence relations have an index -- and explore the consequences of adding the axiom to standard axiom systems for point-free reasoning. Examples of the theorems we prove are that a core/index of a difunction is a bijection, and that the so-called ``all or nothing'' axiom used to facilitate pointwise reasoning is derivable from our axiom of choice.</description>

Abstract: The author has recently introduced an abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions within the general setting of universal algebra. The purpose of this paper is to lift that framework from universal algebra to the strictly more expressive setting of full first-order logic. We show that the so-obtained logic-based framework preserves all desired properties and we prove novel results in that extended setting.</description>

      <title>JustAct+: A Framework for Auditable Multi-Agent Systems Regulated by Inter-Organisational Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In open multi-agent agent systems that cross organisational boundaries, agent actions must be regulated by complex policies. Consider medical data processing systems, which must observe generic laws (e.g., EU data protection regulations) and also specific participants' resource conditions (e.g., Bob consents to sharing his X-Rays with EU hospitals). Presently, we address the implementation of these systems as distributed software. Solutions to key sub-problems are available: existing policy languages capture the necessary normative concepts and formalise the computational representation and reasoning about policies, and existing distributed algorithms and protocols coordinate agents' changing actions and policies. But which policies and protocols are useful in application? With the JustAct framework, we characterise a class of multi-agent systems where actors justify their actions with sufficient policy information collected from dynamic policy statements and agreements. We prove key properties of these systems, e.g., any decision that an action is permitted now cannot be refuted later, regardless of any added statements or updated agreements. We study a particular instance of the framework by specifying (in Rocq) and implementing (in Rust) a particular policy language and runtime system for mediating agent communications. We demonstrate and assess JustAct via a case study of this implementation: we reproduce the usage scenarios of Brane, an existing policy-regulated, inter-domain, medical data processing system.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Decidability of FC-Definable Regular Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FC is a first-order logic that reasons over all factors of a finite word using concatenation, and can define non-regular languages like that of all squares (ww). In this paper, we establish that there are regular languages that are not FC-definable. Moreover, we give a decidable characterization of the FC-definable regular languages in terms of algebra, automata, and regular expressions. The latter of which is natural and concise: Star-free generalized regular expressions extended with the Kleene star of terminal words.</description>

Abstract: We show how interval-based temporal separation on the extension of Moszkowski's discrete time interval temporal logic (Moszkowski, 1986) by the neighbourhood modalities (ITL-NL) and a lemma which is key in establishing this form of separation in (Guelev and Moszkowski, 2022) can be used to obtain concise proofs of an interval-based form of the reactivity normal form as known from (Manna and Pnueli, 1990), the inverse of the temporal projection operator from (Halpern, Manna and Moszkowski, 1983), the elimination of propositional quantification in ITL-NL and, consequently, uniform Craig interpolation and Beth definability for ITL-NL.</description>

      <title>Temporal Causal Reasoning with (Non-Recursive) Structural Equation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural Equation Models (SEM) are the standard approach to representing causal dependencies between variables in causal models. In this paper we propose a new interpretation of SEMs when reasoning about Actual Causality, in which SEMs are viewed as mechanisms transforming the dynamics of exogenous variables into the dynamics of endogenous variables. This allows us to combine counterfactual causal reasoning with existing temporal logic formalisms, and to introduce a temporal logic, CPLTL, for causal reasoning about such structures. We show that the standard restriction to so-called \textit{recursive} models (with no cycles in the dependency graph) is not necessary in our approach, allowing us to reason about mutually dependent processes and feedback loops. Finally, we introduce new notions of model equivalence for temporal causal models, and show that CPLTL has an efficient model-checking procedure.</description>

      <title>Expressive Temporal Specifications for Reward Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.</description>

      <title>Dual Computational Horizons: Incompleteness and Unpredictability in Intelligent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the latter bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot verify its own maximal prediction horizon universally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems. The construction presented here constitutes one representative instance of a broader logical class of such limitations.</description>
