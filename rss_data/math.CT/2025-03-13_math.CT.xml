      <title>Lax functorialities of the comma construction for $\omega$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Grothendieck construction, we study the functorialities of the comma construction for strict $\omega$-categories. To state the most general functorialities, we use the language of Gray $\omega$-categories, that is, categories enriched in the category of strict $\omega$-categories endowed with the oplax Gray tensor product. Our main result is that the comma construction of strict $\omega$-categories defines a Gray $\omega$-functor, that is, a morphism of Gray $\omega$-categories. To makes sense of this statement, we prove that slices of Gray $\omega$-categories exist. Coming back to the Grothendieck construction, we propose a definition in terms of the comma construction and, as a consequence, we get that the Grothendieck construction of strict $\omega$-categories defines a Gray $\omega$-functor. Finally, as a by-product, we get a notion of Grothendieck construction for Gray $\omega$-functors, which we plan to investigate in future work.</description>

      <title>A finite approach to representable multicategories and related structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that monoidal categories have a finite definition, whereas multicategories have an infinite (albeit finitary) definition. Since monoidal categories correspond to representable multicategories, it goes without saying that representable multicategories should also admit a finite description. With this in mind, we give a new finite definition of a structure called a short multicategory, which only has multimaps of dimension at most four, and show that under certain representability conditions short multicategories correspond to various flavours of representable multicategories. This is done in both the classical and skew settings.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian homology and homotopy colimit of classifying spaces for a diagram of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper considers non-Abelian homology groups for a diagram of groups introduced as homotopy groups of a simplicial replacement. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology groups of the group diagram are isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the homotopy colimit of the diagram of classifying spaces, with a dimension shift of 1. As an application, a method is developed for finding a nonzero homotopy group of least dimension for a homotopy colimit of classifying spaces. For a group diagram over a free category with a zero colimit, a criterion for the isomorphism of the first non-Abelian and first Abelian homology groups is obtained. It is established that the non-Abelian homology groups are isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of the colimit functor defined on the category of group diagrams.</description>

      <title>Peter-Weyl theorem for Iwahori groups and highest weight categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebra of functions on the Iwahori group via the category of graded bounded representations of its Lie algebra. In particular, we identify the standard and costandard objects in this category with certain generalized Weyl modules. Using this identification we express the characters of the standard and costandard objects in terms of specialized nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. We also prove that our category of interest admits a generalized highest weight structure (known as stratified structure). We show, more generally, that such a structure on a category of representations of a Lie algebra implies the Peter-Weyl type theorem for the corresponding algebraic group. In the Iwahori case, standard filtrations of indecomposable projective objects correspond to new ``reciprocal'' Macdonald-type identities.</description>

      <title>Adjoints, wrapping, and morphisms at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a localization of a smooth proper category along a subcategory preserved by the Serre functor, we show that morphisms in Efimov's algebraizable categorical formal punctured neighborhood of infinity can be computed using the natural cone between right and left adjoints of the localization functor. In particular, this recovers the following result of Ganatra--Gao--Venkatesh: morphisms in categorical formal punctured neighborhoods of wrapped Fukaya categories are computed by Rabinowitz wrapping.</description>

      <title>Quantifier-free formulas and quantifier alternation depth in doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to incorporate the notion of quantifier-free formulas modulo a first-order theory and the stratification of formulas by quantifier alternation depth modulo a first-order theory into the algebraic treatment of classical first-order logic.
  The set of quantifier-free formulas modulo a theory is axiomatized by what we call a quantifier-free fragment of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Rather than being an intrinsic notion, a quantifier-free fragment is an additional structure on a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Under a smallness assumption, the structures occurring as quantifier-free fragments of some Boolean doctrine with quantifiers are precisely the Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers). In particular, every Boolean doctrine over a small category is a quantifier-free fragment of its quantifier completion.
  Furthermore, the sequences obtained by stratifying an algebra of formulas by quantifier alternation depth modulo a theory are axiomatized by what we call QA-stratified Boolean doctrines. While quantifier-free fragments are defined in relation to an "ambient" Boolean doctrine with quantifiers, a QA-stratified Boolean doctrine requires no such ambient doctrine, and it consists of a sequence of Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers) with connecting axioms. QA-stratified Boolean doctrines are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs consisting of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers and a quantifier-free fragment of it.</description>

      <title>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Categories for Compositional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, conducting task composition by forming cohesive, executable sequences from multiple tasks remains challenging. However, the ability to (de)compose tasks is a linchpin in developing robotic systems capable of learning complex behaviors. Yet, compositional reinforcement learning is beset with difficulties, including the high dimensionality of the problem space, scarcity of rewards, and absence of system robustness after task composition. To surmount these challenges, we view task composition through the prism of category theory -- a mathematical discipline exploring structures and their compositional relationships. The categorical properties of Markov decision processes untangle complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, allowing for strategical reduction of dimensionality, facilitating more tractable reward structures, and bolstering system robustness. Experimental results support the categorical theory of reinforcement learning by enabling skill reduction, reuse, and recycling when learning complex robotic arm tasks.</description>
