      <title>AuNR-SMA: Automated Gold Nanorod Spectral Morphology Analysis Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a colloidal synthesis procedure to produce nanomaterials of a specific size with high shape and size purity is often a time consuming, iterative process. This is often due to the time, resource and expertise intensive characterization methods required for quantitative determination of nanomaterial size and shape. Absorption spectroscopy is often the easiest method of colloidal nanomaterial characterization, however, due to the lack of a reliable method to extract nanoparticle shapes from absorption spectroscopy, it is generally treated as a more qualitative measure for metal nanoparticles. This work demonstrates a gold nanorod (AuNR) spectral morphology analysis (SMA) tool, AuNR-SMA, which is a fast and accurate method to extract quantitative information about an AuNR sample's structural parameters from its absorption spectra. We apply AuNR-SMA in three distinct applications. First, we demonstrate its utility as an automated analysis tool in a high throughput AuNR synthesis procedure by generating quantitative size information from optical spectra. Second, we use the predictions generated by this model to train a machine learning model capable of predicting the resulting AuNR size distributions from the reaction conditions used to synthesize them. Third, we turn this model to spectra extracted from the literature where no size distributions are reported to impute unreported quantitative information of AuNR synthesis. This approach can potentially be extended to any other nanocrystal system where the absorption spectra are size dependent and accurate numerical simulation of the absorption spectra is possible. In addition, this pipeline could be integrated into automated synthesis apparatuses to provide interpretable data from simple measurements and help explore the synthesis science of nanoparticles in a rational manner or facilitate closed-loop workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform readout of a quantum-dot hybrid qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator through a parametric, longitudinal interaction mechanism. Our experiments are performed with the qubit and resonator frequencies detuned by $\sim$10 GHz, demonstrating that longitudinal coupling can facilitate semiconductor qubit operation in the 'ultra-dispersive' regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A class of stable nonlinear non-Hermitian skin modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a well-known phenomenon in open topological systems that causes a large number of eigenstates to become localized at the boundary. Although many aspects of its theory have been investigated in linear systems, this phenomenon remains novel in nonlinear models. In the first step of this paper, we look at the conditions for the presence of quasi-skin modes in a semi-infinite, one-dimensional, nonlinear, nonreciprocal lattice. In the following phase, we explore the survival time of the quasi-skin mode in a finite nonlinear lattice with open edges. We study the dependency of the survival time on the system's parameters and demonstrate how the nonreciprocity of the system affects the survival time. This study introduces a method for achieving a stable localized state in a nonlinear finite lattice.</description>

      <title>Chern Bands' Optimally Localized Wannier Functions and Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent development on fractional Chern insulators and proximate phases call for a real space representation of isolated Chern bands. Here we propose a new method for a general construction of optimally localized Wannier functions from such Chern bands. We do so through an optimal gauge choice of the Bloch states of a Chern band with the singularity placed at any desired position in momentum space. We apply this method to construct the optimally localized Wannier functions for kagome lattice, and use it to identify channels of interactions that are favorable to the development of fractional Chern insulators. Implications of the approach for the interplay between correlations and topology in broader contexts are discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral orbital texture in nonlinear electrical conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear electrical conduction primarily mediated by an orbital texture is observed in chiral semiconductor Te. We determine the enantiospecific sign of the nonlinear conductance and identify anomalies in its carrier-density dependence. Our findings, combined with the Boltzmann equation, are attributed to a chiral orbital texture, namely a chiral distribution of the orbital magnetic moment in reciprocal space. This study underscores the efficacy of nonlinear transport measurements in probing orbital-related effects, whose differentiation from spin counterparts is often demanding in the linear response regime of electron transport.</description>

      <title>Dynamic protected states in the non-Hermitian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect and nonreciprocal behavior are sensitive to the boundary conditions, which are unique features of non-Hermitian systems. The eigenenergies will become complex and all eigenstates are localized at the boundary, which is distinguished from the Hermitian topologies. In this work, we theoretically study the dynamic behavior of the propagation of Gaussian wavepackets inside a non-Hermitian lattice and analyze the self-acceleration process of bulk state or Gaussian wavepackets toward the system's boundary. The initial wavepackets will not only propagate toward the side where the eigenstates are localized, but also their momentum will approach to a specific value where the imaginary parts of energy dispersion are the maximum. In addition, if the wavepackets cover this specific momentum, they will eventually exhibit exponentially increasing amplitudes with time evolution, maintaining the dynamic protected condition for an extended period of time until they approach the boundary. We also take two widely used toy models as examples in one and two dimensions to verify the correspondence of the non-Hermitian skin effect and the dynamic protected state.</description>

      <title>Local thermometry of NbSe$_2$ flake with delta-$T$ noise measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform transport and noise measurements for device consisting of a thin NbSe$_2$ flake laid onto the predefined gold electrodes and covered with a thin hBN flake. In the shot noise of a NbSe$_2$/Au tunnel junction (TJ), we identify Andreev reflection regime by demonstrating the effective charge doubling. Further, by creating temperature gradient across the TJ and measuring its delta-$T$ noise in the normal state, we extract electron-phonon scattering length in NbSe$_2$ and its $T$-dependence. The results of delta-$T$ noise measurements in the absence of a magnetic field when the flake is superconducting are in qualitative agreement with expectations. The introduced approach is promising for the study of nonequilibrium configurations in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Single CdSe Magic-Sized Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical syntheses that provide nanocrystals (NCs) with narrow distributions in size and shape are critical for NC research. This has led to the investigation of magic-sized NCs (MSNCs), a class of semiconductor crystallites that grow in discrete steps, potentially offering a single size and shape (i.e., monodispersity). However, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdSe MSNCs measured at room temperature have been reported to be broader than those of state-of-the-art quantum dots. This difference could be due to the smaller size of MSNCs, which broadens their line widths, or due to their residual size dispersity. To better understand the optical performance of MSNCs, here we perform single-particle spectroscopy. Our results show that, while CdSe MSNCs do exhibit particle-to-particle variations that lead to modest broadening of their ensemble emission spectra, the largest contribution comes from the single-particle line width. By examining MSNCs with different sizes and shells, we conclude that this single-particle broadening is consistent with exciton coupling to acoustic phonons from the NC surface. Because of their small size, this coupling and the role of residual size dispersity have a larger impact on the ensemble emission line widths. Notably, when small (&lt;2.7 nm diameter) MSNCs and quantum dots are compared, the ensemble PL line widths of MSNCs are actually sharper. Due to their small size, MSNCs also exhibit strong anti-bunching $[g^{(2)}(0) \sim 0.05]$ at room temperature. Thus, MSNCs represent a bright, spectrally pure class of quantum emitter, useful for applications in optoelectronic and quantum-information technologies where strong three-dimensional confinement is required.</description>

      <title>Electron bubbles in highly excited states of the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entire energy spectrum of an electron droplet in the lowest Landau level. By exact diagonalization calculations, we find highly excited states in the middle of the spectrum that display unexpected density distribution and pair correlation. We show that these exceptional excited states contain tightly bound electron bubbles with local filling $\nu = 1$ that form various ordered structures. Remarkably, these bubble excited states are shown to exist for both the $1/r$ Coulomb interaction and the $1/r^3$ dipole interaction. The experimental realization of bubble excited states in moir\'e materials under a magnetic field is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains: Majorana quality measures and scaling with increasing chain length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing Majorana bound states (MBSs) in short, well-controllable chains of coupled quantum dots sidesteps the problem of disorder, but requires fine-tuning and does not give the true topological protection inherent to long chains. Here, we introduce a new quality measure that is applicable also in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and that quantifies the closeness to topological protection of finetuned MBSs in short quantum-dot chains. We call this measure local distinguishability because it puts a bound to the degree an arbitrary local measurement can distinguish between two states. We study the local distinguishability for quantum-dot chains of different length. The three-dot chain is studied in detail, and we find that it may not always be an improvement over the two-dot case, a fact that can be understood within an effective model derived from perturbation theory. For longer chains, the local distinguishability vanishes exponentially, signalling a transition to a topological phase with two ground states that cannot be distinguished by any local measurement.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Identification and Statistical Analysis of Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are layered two-dimensional semiconductors explored for various optoelectronic applications, ranging from light-emitting diodes to single-photon emitters. To interact strongly with light, such devices require monolayer TMDs, which exhibit a direct bandgap. These atomically thin sheets are typically obtained through mechanical exfoliation followed by manual identification with a brightfield optical microscope. While this traditional procedure provides high-quality crystals, the identification step is time-intensive, low-throughput, and prone to human error, creating a significant bottleneck for TMD research. Here, we report a simple and fully automated approach for high-throughput identification of TMD monolayers using photoluminescence microscopy. Compared to a manual search and verification, our methodology offers a four-orders-of-magnitude decrease in the time a researcher must invest per identified monolayer. This ability enables us to measure geometric and photoluminescence-intensity features of more than 2,400 monolayers and bilayers of WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$. Due to these large numbers, we can study and quantify material properties previously inaccessible. For example, we show that the mean photoluminescence intensity from a monolayer correlates with its size due to reduced emission from its edges. Further, we observe large variations in brightness (up to 10$\times$) from WSe$_2$ monolayers of different batches produced by the same supplier. Therefore, our automated approach not only increases fabrication efficiency but also enhances sample quality for optoelectronic devices of atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Spin-Wave Properties in Two-Dimensional Magnonic Crystals Formed of Diamond and Triangular Shaped Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferromagnetic nanodot structures exhibit intriguing magnetization dynamics and hold promise for future magnonic devices. In this study, we present a comparative experimental investigation into the reconfigurable magnetization dynamics of non-ellipsoidal diamond and triangular-shaped nanodot structures, employing broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the spin wave (SW) spectra of these structures under different bias field strengths (H) and angles ({\phi}). Notably, the diamond nanodot structure exhibits a variation from nearly symmetric W-shaped dispersion to a skewed dispersion and subsequent transition to a discontinuous dispersion with subtle variation in bias field angle. On the other hand, in the triangular nanodot array a SW mode anti-crossing appears at {\phi} = 15{\deg} which is starkly modified with the increase in {\phi} to 30{\deg}. By analyzing the static magnetic configurations, we unveil the nature of the SW spectra in these two shapes. We reinforce our observations with simulated spatial power and phase maps. This study underscores the critical impact of dot shape and inversion symmetry on SW dynamical response, highlighting the significance of selecting appropriate structures and bias field strength and orientation for required functionalities. The remarkable tunability demonstrated by the magnonic crystals underscores their potential suitability for future magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal phonons in PT-symmetric antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon nonreciprocity, indicating different transport properties along opposite directions, has been observed in experiments under a magnetic field. We show that nonreciprocal acoustic phonons can also exist without a magnetic field nor net magnetization. We focus on PT symmetric antiferromagnets that break both time-reversal T and inversion symmetry P. We identify crucial contributions in phenomenological elastic theory, dubbed flexo-viscosity and flexo-torque, that induce phonon nonreciprocity without changing the phonon polarization. The microscopic origin of these contributions is the molecular Berry curvature, manifested as emergent nonlocal magnetic fields on phonons. The symmetry breaking originated from spin order is transferred to the phonon system through spin-orbit coupling, where the orbital degree of freedom affects the lattice dynamics directly. By electrically modifying the spin-orbit coupling, we show that both the phonon nonreciprocity and helicity can be controlled and enhanced. Importantly, the phonon nonreciprocity is an odd function of the N\'eel vector, serving as an indicator of the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Connecting Q to TCF for MEMS and piezoelectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two critical characteristics for any MEMS resonator are the quality factor ($Q$) and the temperature coefficient of frequency ($TCF$). The connection between $Q$ and $TCF$ is demonstrated here with a phenomenological anharmonic oscillator model. Specifically, it is shown that the same nonlinear terms responsible for the $TCF$ set an upper limit on the resonator's $Q$. A concise formula is found to estimate this loss and is shown to be closely related to Woodruff's formula for Akhiezer damping. The use of this formula is illustrated by extending the model to an important class of MEMS; piezoelectric resonators. Finally, the model is applied to published data for an AlN-on-diamond piezoelectric resonator. The focus here is on MEMS resonators, but the method should apply broadly to any resonance with non-zero $TCF$.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Wannier Localizability and Detachable Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate coupling of a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) to an optomechanical cavity, mediated by the strain of a nano-mechanical mode. The device comprises an optomechanical photonic crystal nanobeam in GaAs with embedded In(Ga)As QDs. The flexural mechanical mode of the device can be optically driven exploiting the large optomechanical coupling rate of the cavity. The vibrations generate a time-modulated strain field that shifts the quantum dot transition energy. We observe that optical driving of the mechanical mode induces a shift in an excitonic line corresponding to an estimated vacuum strain coupling rate of 214 kHz. Our approach represents an important step towards the use of phonons to couple different on-chip quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-filter tunneling detection of antiferromagnetic resonance with electrically-tunable damping</title>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics offers the potential for higher-frequency operations compared to ferromagnetic spintronics and improved insensitivity to magnetic fields. However, previous electrical techniques to detect antiferromagnetic dynamics have required millimeter-scale samples to achieve measurable signals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of antiferromagnetic resonance in devices 1000 times smaller using spin-filter tunneling in micron-scale PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromaget CrSBr. This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$ electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance provides the means to make detailed studies of the physics governing these high-frequency dynamics and to pursue applications including radiation sources, modulators, and detectors.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e plane wave expansion model for scanning tunneling microscopy simulations of incommensurate two-dimensional materials</title>

Abstract: Incommensurate heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials, despite their attractive electronic behaviour, are challenging to simulate because of the absence of translation symmetry. Experimental investigations of these structures often employ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), however there is to date no comprehensive theory to simulate an STM image in such systems. In this paper, we present a geometry-based method to generate STM images in incommensurate van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, which we call the moir\'e plane wave expansion model (MPWEM). We generate the STM images using a weighted sum of three image terms: the non-interacting STM images of (1) the substrate layer, (2) the adsorbate layer, and (3) a semi-empirical Fourier expansion of the moir\'e wavevectors obtained analytically which results from the interaction of (1) and (2). We illustrate and benchmark the model using selected vdW 2D systems composed of structurally and electronically distinct crystals, and show that the method reproduces experimental STM images down to angstrom-scale details. The MPWEM, thanks to its simplicity, can serve as an initial prediction tool prior to more computationally expensive calculations which are often limited by the number of atoms and the requirement of periodic supercells, and thus offers a promising class of computationally-friendly STM simulations, of high relevance in the growing field of twistronics.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous Simulation of Diffusive Charge Transport in Disordered Nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge transport in disordered two-dimensional (2D) systems showcases a myriad of unique phenomenologies that highlight different aspects of the underlying quantum dynamics. Electrons in such systems undergo a crossover from ballistic propagation to Anderson localization, contingent on the system's effective coherence length. Between the extended and localized phases lies a diffusive crossover in which the charge conductivity is properly defined. The numerical observation of this regime has remained elusive because it requires fully coherent transport to be simulated in systems whose dimensions are sufficiently large to meaningfully split the mean-free path and localization length scales. To address this challenge, we employed a novel linear scaling time-resolved approach that enabled us to derive the dc-transport characteristics and observe the three expected 2D transport regimes - ballistic, diffusive, and localized.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a graphene-hBN superlattice field effect transistor</title>

Abstract: Graphene provides a unique platform for hosting high quality 2D electron systems. Encapsulating graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to shield it from noisy environments offers the potential to achieve ultrahigh performance nanodevices, such as photodiodes and transistors. However, the absence of a bandgap at the Dirac point presents challenges for using this system as a useful transistor. In this study, we investigated the functionality of hBN-aligned monolayer graphene as a field effect transistor (FET). By precisely aligning the hBN and graphene, bandgaps open at the first Dirac point and at the hole-doped induced Dirac point via an interfacial moir\'e potential. To characterize this as a submicrometer scale FET, we fabricated a global bottom gate to tune the density of a conducting channel and a local top gate to switch off this channel. This demonstrated that the system could be tuned to an optimal on/off ratio regime by separately controlling the gates. These findings provide a valuable reference point for the further development of FETs based on graphene heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of brightened dark excitons in a high-angle incommensurate Moir\'e homobilayer</title>

Abstract: The last few years have witnessed a surge in interest and research efforts in the field of twistronics, especially in low-angle twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalocogenides. These novel material platforms have been demonstrated to host periodic arrays of excitonic quantum emitters, interlayer excitons with long lifetimes, and exotic many-body states. While much remains to be known and understood about these heterostructures, the field of high-angle, incommensurate bilayers is even less explored. At twist angles larger than a few degrees, the presence of periodicity in these bilayers becomes chaotic, making the systems essentially aperiodic and incommensurate in nature due to the limitations of fabrication techniques. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of a brightened dark intralayer exciton in twisted molybdenum diselenide homobilayer. We show that this dark exciton diffuses across the excitation spot more efficiently as compared to trions or excitons, reaching diffusion lengths greater than 4 microns. Temperature-dependent spectra provide corroborative evidence and reveal a brightened dark trion. Our results reveal some of the richness of the physics of these high-angle systems.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity and Topology in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have recently emerged as an exciting platform for investigating the effects of strong electronic correlations, including various forms of magnetic or electrical orders. Here, we perform an unbiased exact diagonalization study of the effects of interactions on topological flat bands of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at odd integer fillings. For hole-filling $\nu_h = 1$, we find that Chern insulator phases, expected from interaction-induced spin-valley polarization of the bare bands, are quite fragile, and give way to spontaneous multiferroic order -- coexisting ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, in presence of long-range Coulomb repulsion. We provide a simple real-space picture to understand the phase diagram as a function of interaction range and strength. Our findings establish twisted TMDs as a novel and highly tunable platform for multiferroicity, and we outline a potential route towards electrical control of magnetism in the multiferroic phase.</description>

Abstract: Spin waves in magnetic films are affected by the vicinity to a superconductor. Here we focus on a bilayer stack made of an insulating Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film and a high-$T_c$ YBCO superconducting planar resonator and report microwave transmission spectra to monitor the temperature evolution of magnon-photon polaritons. We show that the observed temperature dependence of normal mode splitting and frequency shift with respect to the unperturbed magnon mode can be ultimately related to the penetration depth of YBCO, as an effect of the interplay between spin waves and Meissner currents.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic Skyrmion Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Large anomalous Hall conductivity in Weyl ferrimagnet Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ predicted by density-functional calculations</title>

Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>
