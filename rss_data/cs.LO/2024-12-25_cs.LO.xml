      <title>Compositional Separation of Control Flow and Data Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06397v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every Model of High-Level Computation (MHC) has an underlying composition mechanism for combining simple computation devices into more complex ones. Composition can be done by (explicitly or implicitly) defining control flow, data flow or any combination thereof. Control flow specifies the order in which individual computations are activated, whereas data flow defines how data is exchanged among them. Unfortunately, traditional MHCs either mix data and control or only consider one dimension explicitly, which makes it difficult to reason about data flow and control flow separately. Reasoning about these dimensions orthogonally is a crucial desideratum for optimisation, maintainability and verification purposes. In this paper, we introduce a novel MHC that explicitly treats data flow and control flow as separate dimensions, while providing modularity. As the model is rooted in category theory, it provides category-theoretic operations for compositionally constructing sequential, parallel, branchial or iterative composites. Compositionality entails that a composite exhibits the same properties as its respective constituents, including separation of concerns and modularity. We conclude the paper by demonstrating how our proposal can be used to model high-level computations in two different application domains: software engineering and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Behavioral Theory for Distributed Systems with Weak Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed systems can be subject to various kinds of partial failures, therefore building fault-tolerance or failure mitigation mechanisms for distributed systems remains an important domain of research. In this paper, we present a calculus to formally model distributed systems subject to crash failures with recovery. The recovery model considered in the paper is weak, in the sense that it makes no assumption on the exact state in which a failed node resumes its execution, only its identity has to be distinguishable from past incarnations of itself. Our calculus is inspired in part by the Erlang programming language and in part by the distributed $\pi$-calculus with nodes and link failures (D$\pi$F) introduced by Francalanza and Hennessy. In order to reason about distributed systems with failures and recovery we develop a behavioral theory for our calculus, in the form of a contextual equivalence, and of a fully abstract coinductive characterization of this equivalence by means of a labelled transition system semantics and its associated weak bisimilarity. This result is valuable for it provides a compositional proof technique for proving or disproving contextual equivalence between systems.</description>

      <title>A partial-state space model of unawareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of unawareness that remains close to the paradigm of Aumann's model for knowledge [R. J. Aumann, International Journal of Game Theory 28 (1999) 263-300]: just as Aumann uses a correspondence on a state space to define an agent's knowledge operator on events, we use a correspondence on a state space to define an agent's awareness operator on events. This is made possible by three ideas. First, like the model of [A. Heifetz, M. Meier, and B. Schipper, Journal of Economic Theory 130 (2006) 78-94], ours is based on a space of partial specifications of the world, partially ordered by a relation of further specification or refinement, and the idea that agents may be aware of some coarser-grained specifications while unaware of some finer-grained specifications; however, our model is based on a different implementation of this idea, related to forcing in set theory. Second, we depart from a tradition in the literature, initiated by [S. Modica and A. Rustichini, Theory and Decision 37 (1994) 107-124] and adopted by Heifetz et al. and [J. Li, Journal of Economic Theory 144 (2009) 977-993], of taking awareness to be definable in terms of knowledge. Third, we show that the negative conclusion of a well-known impossibility theorem concerning unawareness in [Dekel, Lipman, and Rustichini, Econometrica 66 (1998) 159-173] can be escaped by a slight weakening of a key axiom. Together these points demonstrate that a correspondence on a partial-state space is sufficient to model unawareness of events. Indeed, we prove a representation theorem showing that any abstract Boolean algebra equipped with awareness, knowledge, and belief operators satisfying some plausible axioms is representable as the algebra of events arising from a partial-state space with awareness, knowledge, and belief correspondences.</description>
