      <title>A remedy to mitigate tensile instability in SPH for simulating large deformation and failure of geomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deformation analysis in geomechanics plays an important role in understanding the nature of post-failure flows and hazards associated with landslides under different natural calamities. In this study, a SPH framework is proposed for large deformation and failure analysis of geomaterials. An adaptive B-spline kernel function in combination with a pressure zone approach is proposed to counteract the numerical issues associated with tensile instability. The proposed algorithm is validated using a soil cylinder drop problem, and the results are compared with FEM. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the successful removal of tensile instability and stress noise is demonstrated using the well-studied slope failure simulation of a cohesive soil vertical cut.</description>

      <title>Stock Market Dynamics Through Deep Learning Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies conducted on financial market prediction lack a comprehensive feature set that can carry a broad range of contributing factors; therefore, leading to imprecise results. Furthermore, while cooperating with the most recent innovations in explainable AI, studies have not provided an illustrative summary of market-driving factors using this powerful tool. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel feature matrix that holds a broad range of features including Twitter content and market historical data to perform a binary classification task of one step ahead prediction. The utilization of our proposed feature matrix not only leads to improved prediction accuracy when compared to existing feature representations, but also its combination with explainable AI allows us to introduce a fresh analysis approach regarding the importance of the market-driving factors included. Thanks to the Lime interpretation technique, our interpretation study shows that the volume of tweets is the most important factor included in our feature matrix that drives the market's movements.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Enhanced Predictors for Accelerated Convergence of Partitioned Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable partitioned techniques for simulating unsteady fluid-structure interaction (FSI) are known to be computationally expensive when high added-mass is involved. Multiple coupling strategies have been developed to accelerate these simulations, but often use predictors in the form of simple finite-difference extrapolations. In this work, we propose a non-intrusive data-driven predictor that couples reduced-order models of both the solid and fluid subproblems, providing an initial guess for the nonlinear problem of the next time step calculation. Each reduced order model is composed of a nonlinear encoder-regressor-decoder architecture and is equipped with an adaptive update strategy that adds robustness for extrapolation. In doing so, the proposed methodology leverages physics-based insights from high-fidelity solvers, thus establishing a physics-aware machine learning predictor. Using three strongly coupled FSI examples, this study demonstrates the improved convergence obtained with the new predictor and the overall computational speedup realized compared to classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-Time Urban Physics Simulations with Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban populations continue to grow, highlighting the critical need to safeguard civilians against potential disruptions, such as dangerous gas contaminant dispersion. The digital twin (DT) framework offers promise in analyzing and predicting such events. This study presents a computational framework for modelling airborne contaminant dispersion in built environments. Leveraging automatic generation of computational domains and solution processes, the proposed framework solves the underlying physical model equations with the finite element method (FEM) for numerical solutions. Model order reduction (MOR) methods are investigated to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. The study outlines the automatic model generation process, the details of the employed model, and the future perspectives for the realization of a DT. Throughout this research, the aim is to develop a reliable predictive model combining physics and data in a hybrid DT to provide informed real-time support within evacuation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised feature distillation and design of experiments for efficient training of micromechanical deep learning surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning surrogate emulators are needed in engineering design and optimization tasks to rapidly emulate computationally expensive physics-based models. In micromechanics problems the local full-field response variables are desired at microstructural length scales. While there has been a great deal of work on establishing architectures for these tasks there has been relatively little work on establishing microstructural experimental design strategies. This work demonstrates that intelligent selection of microstructural volume elements for subsequent physics simulations enables the establishment of more accurate surrogate models. There exist two key challenges towards establishing a suitable framework: (1) microstructural feature quantification and (2) establishment of a criteria which encourages construction of a diverse training data set. Three feature extraction strategies are used as well as three design criteria. A novel contrastive feature extraction approach is established for automated self-supervised extraction of microstructural summary statistics. Results indicate that for the problem considered up to a 8\% improvement in surrogate performance may be achieved using the proposed design and training strategy. Trends indicate this approach may be even more beneficial when scaled towards larger problems. These results demonstrate that the selection of an efficient experimental design is an important consideration when establishing machine learning based surrogate models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the integration of generative techniques into spatial-temporal data mining, considering the significant growth and diverse nature of spatial-temporal data. With the advancements in RNNs, CNNs, and other non-generative techniques, researchers have explored their application in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies within spatial-temporal data. However, the emergence of generative techniques such as LLMs, SSL, Seq2Seq and diffusion models has opened up new possibilities for enhancing spatial-temporal data mining further. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative technique-based spatial-temporal methods and introduces a standardized framework specifically designed for the spatial-temporal data mining pipeline. By offering a detailed review and a novel taxonomy of spatial-temporal methodology utilizing generative techniques, the paper enables a deeper understanding of the various techniques employed in this field. Furthermore, the paper highlights promising future research directions, urging researchers to delve deeper into spatial-temporal data mining. It emphasizes the need to explore untapped opportunities and push the boundaries of knowledge to unlock new insights and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial-temporal data mining. By integrating generative techniques and providing a standardized framework, the paper contributes to advancing the field and encourages researchers to explore the vast potential of generative techniques in spatial-temporal data mining.</description>

      <title>LLM and Simulation as Bilevel Optimizers: A New Paradigm to Advance Physical Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have recently gained significant attention in scientific discovery for their extensive knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. However, they encounter challenges in effectively simulating observational feedback and grounding it with language to propel advancements in physical scientific discovery. Conversely, human scientists undertake scientific discovery by formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and revising theories through observational analysis. Inspired by this, we propose to enhance the knowledge-driven, abstract reasoning abilities of LLMs with the computational strength of simulations. We introduce Scientific Generative Agent (SGA), a bilevel optimization framework: LLMs act as knowledgeable and versatile thinkers, proposing scientific hypotheses and reason about discrete components, such as physics equations or molecule structures; meanwhile, simulations function as experimental platforms, providing observational feedback and optimizing via differentiability for continuous parts, such as physical parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our framework's efficacy in constitutive law discovery and molecular design, unveiling novel solutions that differ from conventional human expectations yet remain coherent upon analysis.</description>

      <title>A Modified CTGAN-Plus-Features Based Method for Optimal Asset Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to portfolio optimization that utilizes a unique combination of synthetic data generation and a CVaR-constraint. We formulate the portfolio optimization problem as an asset allocation problem in which each asset class is accessed through a passive (index) fund. The asset-class weights are determined by solving an optimization problem which includes a CVaR-constraint. The optimization is carried out by means of a Modified CTGAN algorithm which incorporates features (contextual information) and is used to generate synthetic return scenarios, which, in turn, are fed into the optimization engine. For contextual information we rely on several points along the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The merits of this approach are demonstrated with an example based on ten asset classes (covering stocks, bonds, and commodities) over a fourteen-and-half year period (January 2008-June 2022). We also show that the synthetic generation process is able to capture well the key characteristics of the original data, and the optimization scheme results in portfolios that exhibit satisfactory out-of-sample performance. We also show that this approach outperforms the conventional equal-weights (1/N) asset allocation strategy and other optimization formulations based on historical data only.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Digital Twin Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Protein Language Model for Unified Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein language models have demonstrated significant potential in the field of protein engineering. However, current protein language models primarily operate at the residue scale, which limits their ability to provide information at the atom level. This limitation prevents us from fully exploiting the capabilities of protein language models for applications involving both proteins and small molecules. In this paper, we propose ESM-AA (ESM All-Atom), a novel approach that enables atom-scale and residue-scale unified molecular modeling. ESM-AA achieves this by pre-training on multi-scale code-switch protein sequences and utilizing a multi-scale position encoding to capture relationships among residues and atoms. Experimental results indicate that ESM-AA surpasses previous methods in protein-molecule tasks, demonstrating the full utilization of protein language models. Further investigations reveal that through unified molecular modeling, ESM-AA not only gains molecular knowledge but also retains its understanding of proteins.</description>
