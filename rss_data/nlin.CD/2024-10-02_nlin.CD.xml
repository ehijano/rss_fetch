      <title>Tipping mechanisms in a carbon cycle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when a ramp parameter changes rapidly enough to cause the system to tip between co-existing, attracting states, while noise-induced tipping (N-tipping) occurs when there are random transitions between two attractors of the underlying deterministic system. This work investigates R-tipping and N-tipping events in a carbonate system in the upper ocean, in which the key objective is understanding how the system undergoes tipping away from a stable fixed point in a bistable regime. While R-tipping away from the fixed point is straightforward, N-tipping poses challenges due to a periodic orbit forming the basin boundary for the attracting fixed point of the underlying deterministic system. Furthermore, in the case of N-tipping, we are interested in the case where noise is away from the small noise limit, as it is more appropriate for the application. We compute the most probable escape path (MPEP) for our system, resulting in a firm grasp on the least action path in an asymmetric system of higher scale. Our analysis shows that the carbon cycle model is susceptible to both tipping mechanisms when using the standard formulations.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of chaotic systems in latent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations, and their chaotic solutions, are pervasive in the modelling of complex systems in engineering, science, and beyond. Data-driven methods can find solutions to partial differential equations with a divide-and-conquer strategy: The solution is sought in a latent space, on which the temporal dynamics are inferred (``latent-space'' approach). This is achieved by, first, compressing the data with an autoencoder, and, second, inferring the temporal dynamics with recurrent neural networks. The overarching goal of this paper is to show that a latent-space approach can not only infer the solution of a chaotic partial differential equation, but it can also predict the stability properties of the physical system. First, we employ the convolutional autoencoder echo state network (CAE-ESN) on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation for various chaotic regimes. We show that the CAE-ESN (i) finds a low-dimensional latent-space representation of the observations and (ii) accurately infers the Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) in this low-dimensional manifold for different attractors. Second, we extend the CAE-ESN to a turbulent flow, comparing the Lyapunov spectrum to estimates obtained from Jacobian-free methods. A latent-space approach based on the CAE-ESN effectively produces a latent space that preserves the key properties of the chaotic system, such as Lyapunov exponents and CLVs, thus retaining the geometric structure of the attractor. The latent-space approach based on the CAE-ESN is a reduced-order model that accurately predicts the dynamics of the chaotic system, or, alternatively, it can be used to infer stability properties of chaotic systems from data.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrically connected reservoir networks learn better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that connectivity within the high-dimensional recurrent layer of a reservoir network is crucial for its performance. To this end, we systematically investigate the impact of network connectivity on its performance, i.e., we examine the symmetry and structure of the reservoir in relation to its computational power. Reservoirs with random and asymmetric connections are found to perform better for an exemplary Mackey-Glass time series than all structured reservoirs, including biologically inspired connectivities, such as small-world topologies. This result is quantified by the information processing capacity of the different network topologies which becomes highest for asymmetric and randomly connected networks.</description>
