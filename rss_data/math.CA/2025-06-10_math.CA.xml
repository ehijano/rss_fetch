      <title>Strictly Expansive Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $A$ is an integer valued, strictly expansive matrix, then there exists an orthonormal $A$-wavelet whose Fourier transform is compactly supported and smooth. We show that strongly connected diagonally dominant integer matrices are strictly expansive, and that integer matrices with determinant two are not strictly expansive with respect to particularly nice sets.</description>

      <title>On the logarithmic equilibrium measure on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be the logarithmic equilibrium measure on a compact set $\gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$. We prove that $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the length measure on the part of $\gamma$ which can be locally expressed as the graph of a $C^{1,\alpha}$-function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{d - 1}$, $\alpha &gt; 0$.
  For $d = 2$, at least in the case where $\gamma$ is a compact $C^{1,\alpha}$-graph, our result can also be deduced from the classical fact that $\mu$ coincides with the harmonic measure of $\Omega =\mathbb{R}^{2} \, \setminus \, \gamma$ with pole at $\infty$. For $d \geq 3$, however, our result is new even for $C^{\infty}$-graphs. In fact, up to now it was not even known if the support of $\mu$ has positive dimension.</description>

      <title>Analytic Uniqueness of Ball Volume Interpolation: Categorical Invariance and Universal Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the classical volume formula for the unit $x$-ball, \[ V_x = \frac{\pi^{x/2}}{\Gamma(x/2+1)}, \] can be characterized as the \emph{unique} analytic continuation of Haar measure normalization and unit ball volumes for $\mathrm{O}(n)$, under principles of categorical invariance and normalization at integer dimensions. We generalize this result to the unitary and symplectic cases, formalize invariance using categorical language, and construct explicit categorical examples with functorial diagrams. This perspective positions $V_x$ and its analogues as canonical analytic objects at the interface of analysis, representation theory, and category theory, and motivates a broader program of exploring categorical invariants for interpolated symmetry.</description>

      <title>A critical majorant for the Khinchin-Ostrowski property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we prove an optimal version of a classical result. Given a majorant determining a growth restriction on functions in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, we say that a set $E$ on the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$ is a uniqueness set, or has the Khinchin-Ostrowski property, with respect to the majorant, if any sequence of analytic polynomials satisfying the growth restriction which converges in an appropriate sense to $0$ on $E$, in fact is forced to converge to $0$ in $\mathbb{D}$ also. Theorems proved by Kegejan and Khrushchev state that if $E$ has positive Lebesgue measure and satisfies a generalized Beurling-Carleson condition, then for an appropriate majorant the Khinchin-Ostrowski property is satisfied. A technical point in Khrushchev's proof is the estimation of the harmonic measure in a Privalov-type domain which requires logarithmic integrability of the majorant. This forbids the application of his result to certain types of generalized Beurling-Carleson conditions. Here, we dispose of the integrability assumption on the majorant. To do so, we use a Joukowski-Privalov domain which is obtained by removing from the unit disk the areas enclosed by hyperbolic geodesics between the endpoints of intervals complementary to $E$. For this type of domain the method of Khrushchev applies, but the harmonic measure may be estimated more accurately by simple explicit formulas for conformal mappings. As a consequence, we find the critical majorant at which Beurling-Carleson type conditions stop determining the Khinchin-Ostrowski property of a set, and above which the containment of intervals is the only relevant characteristic. We discuss also weighted versions of the Khinchin-Ostrowski property, and apply our result to establish the remarkable precision of a one-sided spectral decay condition which detects the local logarithmic integrability of a function.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequalities and Wiener--Stein theorem on fractal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a self-similar set with Hausdorff dimension $s$, and $\mu$ be a self-similar probability measure supported on $K$. Let $H^{\alpha}_\mu$, $0&lt;\alpha\le s$, be the Hausdorff content on $K$, and $M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu $ be the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator defined on $K$ associated with its basic cubes $\mathcal{D}$. In this paper, we establish quantitative strong type and weak type Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequalities on fractal set $K$ with respect to $H^{\alpha}_\mu$ for all range $0&lt;\alpha\le s$.
  As applications, the Lebesgue differentiation theorem on $K$ is proved. Moreover, via the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator $M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu $, we characterize the Lebesgue--Choquet space $L^p(K,H^{\alpha}_\mu)$ and the Zygmund space $L\log L(K,\mu)$. To be exact, given $\alpha/s&lt; p\le \infty$, we discover that \[ \text{$f\in L^p(K,H^{\alpha}_\mu)$ if and only if $M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu f\in L^p(K,H^{\alpha}_\mu)$}\] and, for $f\in L^1(K,\mu)$, \[\text{$M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu f\in L^1(K,\mu)$ if and only if $f\in L\log L(K,\mu)$}. \] That is, Wiener's $L\log L$ inequality and its converse inequality due to Stein in 1969 are extended to fractal set $K$ with respect to $\mu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Hausdorff-Young-type inequalities within the framework of Lorentz spaces $L_{p,q}$. Focusing on the dependence of the associated constants on the integrability parameter $p$, we derive optimal bounds in the limiting case $p\rightarrow 2$, addressing the Herz-Bochkarev problem. The results obtained refine the pioneering estimates in [3] and are comparable to recent advances in [16]. The main ingredients of our approach are new grand Lorentz space techniques.</description>

      <title>Periodicity in delayed self-regulation is a predator-prey process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify two different periodicity mechanisms: delayed self-regulation and planar predator-prey feedback. We consider scalar delay differential equations $\dot x(t) = rf(x(t), x(t - 1))$ where $f$ is monotone in the delayed component. Due to a Poincar\'{e}--Bendixson theorem for monotone delayed feedback systems, the typical global dynamics present periodic orbits as the delay parameter $r$ increases. In this article, we show that, as we vary the delay, each connected component of periodic orbits is an annulus with global coordinates given by the time and the amplitude of the corresponding periodic solutions. On each annulus, the variables $x(t)$ and $x(t - 1)$ solve an integrable ordinary differential equation that satisfies a predator-prey feedback relation. Moreover, we completely characterize the set of periodic solutions of the delay differential equation in terms of two time maps generated by the underlying predator-prey system.</description>

      <title>GBDT with nontrivial seeds: explicit solutions of the focusing NLS equations and the corresponding Weyl functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our GBDT (generalised B\"acklund-Darboux transformation) approach is used to construct explicit solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation in the case of the exponential seed $a \exp\{2 i (cx +dt)\}$. The corresponding Baker-Akhiezer functions and evolution of the Weyl functions are obtained as well. In particular, the solutions, which appear in the study of rogue waves, step-like solutions and $N$-modulation solutions of the NLS equation are considered. This work is an essential development of our joint work with Rien Kaashoek and Israel Gohberg, where the seed was trivial, as well as several other of our previous works.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the multiplicity and the number of limit cycles for planar piecewise linear system divided into two regions by a straight line and each linear subsystem has a node. Through constructing Poincare half maps and a successor function, and analyzing the properties of the successor function, we can derive that this system has at most two limit cycles, counting the multiplicities of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Problem for Single Trajectories of Rough Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to develop a general framework for performing statistical inference for discretely observed random rough differential equations, our aim is to construct a geometric $p$-rough path ${\bf X}$ whose response $Y$, when driving a rough differential equation, matches the observed trajectory $y$. We call this the \textit{continuous inverse problem} and start by rigorously defining its solution. We then develop a framework where the solution can be constructed as a limit of solutions to appropriately designed \textit{discrete inverse problems}, so that convergence holds in $p$-variation. Our approach is based on calibrating the bounded variation paths whose limit defines the rough path `lift' of path $X$ to rough path ${\bf X}$ to the observed trajectory $y$. Moreover, we develop a general numerical algorithm for constructing the solution to the discrete inverse problem. The core idea of the algorithm is to use the signature representation of the path, iterating between the response and the control, each time correcting according to the required properties.
  We apply our framework to the case where the geometric $p$-rough path ${\bf X}$ is defined as the limit of piecewise linear paths in the $p$-variation topology. We express the discrete inverse problem for a fixed observation rate as a solution to a system of equations driven by piecewise linear paths and prove convergence to the solution of the continuous inverse problem for observation time $\delta\to 0$. Finally, we show that, in this context, the numerical algorithm for solving the discrete inverse problem simplifies to an iterative simultaneous update of the local gradients and we prove that it converges in $p$-variation uniformly with respect to $\delta$.</description>

      <title>Herz-Type Hardy Spaces Associated with Ball Quasi-Banach Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a ball quasi-Banach function space, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$ and $q\in(0,\infty)$. In this paper, the authors first introduce the Herz-type Hardy space $\mathcal{H\dot{K}}_{X}^{\alpha,\,q}({\mathbb {R}}^n)$, which is defined via the non-tangential grand maximal function. Under some mild assumptions on $X$, the authors establish the atomic decompositions of $\mathcal{H\dot{K}}_{X}^{\alpha,\,q}({\mathbb {R}}^n)$. As an application, the authors
  obtain the boundedness of certain sublinear operators from $\mathcal{H\dot{K}}_{X}^{\alpha,\,q}({\mathbb {R}}^n)$ to $\mathcal{\dot{K}}_{X}^{\alpha,\,q}({\mathbb {R}}^n)$, where $\mathcal{\dot{K}}_{X}^{\alpha,\,q}({\mathbb {R}}^n)$ denotes the Herz-type space associated with ball quasi-Banach function space $X$. Finally, the authors apply these results to three concrete function spaces: Herz-type Hardy spaces with variable exponent, mixed Herz-Hardy spaces and Orlicz-Herz Hardy spaces, which belong to the family of Herz-type Hardy spaces associated with ball quasi-Banach function spaces.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we investigate some applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). We use Clarke subdifferentials instead of derivative and Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of their graphs instead of local uniform convergence. Next we focus on reverse theorem. We show that Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed nonempty sets implies convergence of distance functions and Clark subdifferentials of squared distance functions, but does not imply convergence of Clark subdifferentials of distance functions. Finally we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to unify the theory of weights beyond the setting of weighted Lebesgue spaces in the general setting of quasi-Banach function spaces. We prove new characterizations for the boundedness of singular integrals, pose several conjectures, and prove partial results related to the duality of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. Furthermore, we give an overview of the theory applied to weighted variable Lebesgue, Morrey, and Musielak-Orlicz spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical kernel ridge regression problem aims to find the best fit for the output $Y$ as a function of the input data $X\in \mathbb{R}^d$, with a fixed choice of regularization term imposed by a given choice of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, such as a Sobolev space. Here we consider a generalization of the kernel ridge regression problem, by introducing an extra matrix parameter $U$, which aims to detect the scale parameters and the feature variables in the data, and thereby improve the efficiency of kernel ridge regression. This naturally leads to a nonlinear variational problem to optimize the choice of $U$. We study various foundational mathematical aspects of this variational problem, and in particular how this behaves in the presence of multiscale structures in the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bansah and Sehba studied in [3] the boundedness of a family of Hilbert-type integral operators, where they characterized the $L^{p}-L^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. In this paper, we deal with the corresponding discrete Hilbert-type operators acting on the weighted sequence spaces. We establish some sufficient and necessary conditions for the $l^{p}-l^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. We find out that the conditions of the boundedness of discrete Hilbert-type operators are different from those of the boundedness of Hilbert-type integral operators. Also, for some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for discrete Hilbert-type operators. Finally, it is pointed out that certain extensions of the theorems given in [3] can be established by using our different arguments.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a bounded Jordan curve and $\Omega_i,\Omega_e$ its two complementary components. For $s\in(0,1)$ we define $\mathcal{H}^s(\Gamma)$ as the set of functions $f:\Gamma\to \mathbb C$ having harmonic extension $u$ in $\Omega_i\cup \Omega_e$ such that $$ \iint_{\Omega_i\cup \Omega_e} |\nabla u(z)|^2 d(z,\Gamma)^{1-2s} dxdy&lt;+\infty.$$ If $\Gamma$ is further assumed to be rectifiable we define $H^s(\Gamma)$ as the space of measurable functions $f:\Gamma\to \mathbb C$ such that $$\iint_{\Gamma\times \Gamma}\frac{|f(z)-f(\zeta)|^2}{|z-\zeta|^{1+2s}} d\sigma(z)d\sigma(\zeta)&lt;+\infty.$$ When $\Gamma$ is the unit circle these two spaces coincide with the homogeneous fractional Sobolev space defined via Fourier series. For a general rectifiable curve these two spaces need not coincide and our first goal is to investigate the cases of equality: while the chord-arc property is the necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the classical case of $s=1/2$, this is no longer the case for general $s\in (0,1)$. We show however that equality holds for Lipschitz curves.
  The second goal involves the Plemelj-Calder\'on problem. ......</description>
