      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Elasticity on a Private On-the-Job Search Platform: Evidence from Japan, 2014-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I use proprietary data from the online job scouting platform BizReach in Japan, spanning from 2014 to 2024, to estimate the matching function for high-skill employed workers on a private on-the-job search platform, employing a novel nonparametric approach developed by Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). This analysis is compared to the public off-the-job search platform, Hello Work. The results indicate that matching efficiency on the private platform is both more volatile and higher than that of the public platform, suggesting the increasing popularity of the private platform. The matching elasticity with respect to users consistently hovers around 0.75, while the elasticity with respect to vacancies reaches approximately 1.0, indicating a higher and more balanced elasticity compared to the Hello Work platform. Additionally, the study reveals evidence of industry-level heterogeneity on the private platform.</description>

      <title>Estimating Spillovers from Sampled Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical researchers often estimate spillover effects by fitting linear or non-linear regression models to sampled network data. Here, we show that common sampling schemes induce dependence between observed and unobserved spillovers. Due to this dependence, spillover estimates are biased, often upwards. We then show how researchers can construct unbiased estimates of spillover effects by rescaling using aggregate network statistics. Our results can be used to bound true effect sizes, determine robustness of estimates to missingness, and construct estimates when missingness depends on treatment. We apply our results to re-estimate the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks between US public firms, and peer effects amongst USAFA cadets.</description>

      <title>Workplace Breastfeeding Legislation and Female Labor Force Participation in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the effects of legislation mandating the provision of workplace breastfeeding amenities on the labor force participation of women in the United States. Using both the American Community Survey and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in a staggered difference-in-differences framework, I find evidence that workplace breastfeeding legislation significantly increases the likelihood of female labor force participation (FLFP) across both datasets and multiple specifications, by at least 1.5 percentage points. The timing and magnitude of the post-law increases in FLFP differ across the two datasets. I bolster the analyses using the CDC's Infant Feeding Practices Survey and the Childhood and Adoption Supplement to the PSID, which further suggest an influence of the laws on breastfeeding women. Heterogeneity analysis indicates the presence of substantial treatment effect heterogeneity across subgroups, but the findings are specific to the separate datasets. Across both datasets, the legislation appears to be more effective in states where average pre-law FLFP was comparatively low. I also find evidence of a negative spillover effect, whereby women without children and women with older children may have reduced their LFP in response to the legislation.</description>

      <title>Global Factors in Non-core Bank Funding and Exchange Rate Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that fluctuations in the ratio of non-core to core funding in the banking systems of advanced economies are largely driven by three global factors of both real and financial natures, with country-specific factors playing only a minor role. Exchange rate flexibility and tighter macroprudential regulations help insulate the non-core to core ratio from such global factors. Further, insulation is stronger in periods away from global crises.</description>

      <title>Monetary Policies on Green Financial Markets: Evidence from a Multi-Moment Connectedness Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-moment connectedness network approach for analyzing the interconnectedness of green financial market. Focusing on the impact of monetary policy shocks, our study reveals that connectedness within the green bond and equity markets varies with different moments (returns, volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) and changes significantly around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) events. Static analysis shows a decrease in connectedness with higher moments, while dynamic analysis highlights increased sensitivity to event-driven shocks. We find that both tight and loose monetary policy shocks initially elevate connectedness within the first six months. However, the effects of tight shocks gradually fade, whereas loose shocks may reduce connectedness after one year. These results offer insight to policymakers in regulating sustainable economies and investment managers in strategizing asset allocation and risk management, especially in environmentally focused markets. Our study contributes to understanding the complex dynamics of the green financial market in response to monetary policies, helping in decision-making for sustainable economic development and financial stability.</description>

      <title>Industrial complexity and the evolution of formal employment in developing cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What drives formal employment creation in developing cities? We find that larger cities, home to an abundant set of complex industries, employ a larger share of their working age population in formal jobs. We propose a hypothesis to explain this pattern, arguing that it is the organised nature of formal firms, whereby workers with complementary skills are coordinated in teams, that enables larger cities to create more formal employment. From this perspective, the growth of formal employment is dependent on the ability of a city to build on existing skills to enter new complex industries. To test our hypothesis, we construct a variable which captures the skill-proximity of cities' current industrial base to new complex industries, termed 'complexity potential'. Our main result is that complexity potential is robustly associated with subsequent growth of the formal employment rate in Colombian cities.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Economic Impact of Rationality through Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome some of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium assumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined 'bounded rational' behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to justify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the capabilities of ABMs with the introduction of 'fully rational' agents that learn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward function. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by extending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that gradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to maximise profits, allows for studying the impact of rationality on the economy. We find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for maximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market competition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent policies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously learn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market power and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher number of rational (RL) agents in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as measured by total output. Depending on the specific rational policy, this can come at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework allows for stable multi-agent learning, is available in open source, and represents a principled and robust direction to extend economic simulators.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-Assisted Decision Making and Racial Disparities in Housing: A Study of the Allegheny Housing Assessment Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for housing assistance across the United States far exceeds the supply, leaving housing providers the task of prioritizing clients for receipt of this limited resource. To be eligible for federal funding, local homelessness systems are required to implement assessment tools as part of their prioritization processes. The Vulnerability Index Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) is the most commonly used assessment tool nationwide. Recent studies have criticized the VI-SPDAT as exhibiting racial bias, which may lead to unwarranted racial disparities in housing provision. In response to these criticisms, some jurisdictions have developed alternative tools, such as the Allegheny Housing Assessment (AHA), which uses algorithms to assess clients' risk levels. Drawing on data from its deployment, we conduct descriptive and quantitative analyses to evaluate whether replacing the VI-SPDAT with the AHA affects racial disparities in housing allocation. We find that the VI-SPDAT tended to assign higher risk scores to white clients and lower risk scores to Black clients, and that white clients were served at a higher rates pre-AHA deployment. While post-deployment service decisions became better aligned with the AHA score, and the distribution of AHA scores is similar across racial groups, we do not find evidence of a corresponding decrease in disparities in service rates. We attribute the persistent disparity to the use of Alt-AHA, a survey-based tool that is used in cases of low data quality, as well as group differences in eligibility-related factors, such as chronic homelessness and veteran status. We discuss the implications for housing service systems seeking to reduce racial disparities in their service delivery.</description>

      <title>Three connected problems: principal with multiple agents in cooperation, Principal--Agent with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics and multitask Principal--Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address three Principal--Agent problems in a moral hazard context and show that they are connected. We start by studying the problem of Principal with multiple Agents in cooperation. The term cooperation is manifested here by the fact that the agents optimize their criteria through Pareto equilibria. We show that as the number of agents tends to infinity, the principal's value function converges to the value function of a McKean--Vlasov control problem. Using the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem, we derive a constructive method for obtaining approximately optimal contracts for the principal's problem with multiple agents in cooperation. In a second step, we show that the problem of Principal with multiple Agents turns out to also converge, when the number of agents goes to infinity, towards a new Principal--Agent problem which is the Principal--Agent problem with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics. This is a Principal--Agent problem where the agent--controlled production follows a Mckean-Vlasov dynamics and the contract can depend of the distribution of the production. The value function of the principal in this setting is equivalent to that of the same McKean--Vlasov control problem from the multi--agent scenario. Furthermore, we show that an optimal contract can be constructed from the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem. We conclude by discussing, in a simple example, the connection of these problems with the multitask Principal--Agent problem which is a situation when a principal delegates multiple tasks that can be correlated to a single agent.</description>
