      <title>Generative diffusion model surrogates for mechanistic agent-based biological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.</description>

      <title>An Integrated UVM-TLM Co-Simulation Framework for RISC-V Functional Verification and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning RISC-V ecosystem necessitates efficient verification methodologies for complex processors. Traditional approaches often struggle to concurrently evaluate functional correctness and performance, or balance simulation speed with modeling accuracy. This paper introduces an integrated co-simulation framework leveraging Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) and Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) for RISC-V processor validation. We present a configurable UVM-TLM model (vmodel) of a superscalar, out-of-order RISC-V core, featuring key microarchitectural modeling techniques such as credit-based pipeline flow control. This environment facilitates unified functional verification via co-simulation against the Spike ISA simulator and enables early-stage performance assessment using benchmarks like CoreMark, orchestrated within UVM. The methodology prioritizes integration, simulation efficiency, and acceptable fidelity for architectural exploration over cycle-level precision. Experimental results validate functional correctness and significant simulation speedup over RTL approaches, accelerating design iterations and enhancing verification coverage.</description>

      <title>Assessing Tenstorrent's RISC-V MatMul Acceleration Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for generative AI as Large Language Models (LLMs) services has driven the need for specialized hardware architectures that optimize computational efficiency and energy consumption. This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.</description>
