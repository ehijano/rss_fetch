      <title>Singular Arrange and Traverse Algorithm for Computing Reeb Spaces of Bivariate PL Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact and efficient algorithm for computing the Reeb space of a bivariate PL map. The Reeb space is a topological structure that generalizes the Reeb graph to the setting of multiple scalar-valued functions defined over a shared domain, a situation that frequently arises in practical applications. While the Reeb graph has become a standard tool in computer graphics, shape analysis, and scientific visualization, the Reeb space is still in the early stages of adoption. Although several algorithms for computing the Reeb space have been proposed, none offer an implementation that is both exact and efficient, which has substantially limited its practical use. To address this gap, we introduce singular arrange and traverse, a new algorithm built upon the arrange and traverse framework. Our method exploits the fact that, in the bivariate case, only singular edges contribute to the structure of Reeb space, allowing us to ignore many regular edges. This observation results in substantial efficiency gains on datasets where most edges are regular, which is common in many numerical simulations of physical systems. We provide an implementation of our method and benchmark it against the original arrange and traverse algorithm, showing performance gains of up to four orders of magnitude on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Open Platonic Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sol LeWitt famously enumerated all the incomplete open cubes, finding 122 of these connected, non-planar subsets of the edges of the cube.
  Since then, while several projects have revisited the cube enumeration, no such enumeration has been published for any other interesting solid.
  In this paper we present work on enumerating all the incomplete open platonic solids, finding 6 tetrahedra, 122 cubes (just like LeWitt), 185 octahedra, 2\,423\,206 dodecahedra and 16\,096\,166 icosahedra.</description>

      <title>A Morton-Type Space-Filling Curve for Pyramid Subdivision and Hybrid Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forest-of-refinement-trees approach allows for dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) at negligible cost. While originally developed for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, previous work established the theory and algorithms for unstructured meshes of simplicial and prismatic elements. To harness the full potential of tree-based AMR for three-dimensional mixed-element meshes, this paper introduces the pyramid as a new functional element type; its primary purpose is to connect tetrahedral and hexahedral elements without hanging edges.We present a well-defined space-filling curve (SFC) for the pyramid and detail how the unique challenges on the element and forest level associated with the pyramidal refinement are resolved. We propose the necessary functional design and generalize the fundamental global parallel algorithms for refinement, coarsening, partitioning, and face ghost exchange to fully support this new element. Our demonstrations confirm the efficiency and scalability of this complete, hybrid-element dynamic AMR framework.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of covering points by guillotine cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the problem of covering a set of points in the plane with a minimum number of guillotine cuts is NP-complete. To that end, first we present a new NP-completeness proof for the problem of covering points with disjoint line segments. Then, we adapt the proof to show that the problem remains NP-complete when the segments are guillotine cuts.</description>

      <title>Local certification of geometric graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16953v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of local certification is to locally convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies a given property. A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize the size of the certificates.
  In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. These bounds are tight up to a constant factor and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have linear size. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on the size of the certificates, and an upper bound of $O(n \log n)$. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable patterns and plane paths in dense topological graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C_{s,t}$ be the complete bipartite geometric graph, with $s$ and $t$ vertices on two distinct parallel lines respectively, and all $s t$ straight-line edges drawn between them. In this paper, we show that every complete bipartite simple topological graph, with parts of size $2(k-1)^4 + 1$ and $2^{k^{5k}}$, contains a topological subgraph weakly isomorphic to $C_{k,k}$. As a corollary, every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length $k$ has at most $O_k(n^{2 - 8/k^4})$ edges. When $k = 3$, we obtain a stronger bound by showing that every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length 3 has at most $O(n^{4/3})$ edges. We also prove that $x$-monotone simple topological graphs not containing a plane path of length 3 have at most a linear number of edges.</description>
