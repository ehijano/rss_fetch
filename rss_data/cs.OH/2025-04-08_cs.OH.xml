      <title>PrediHealth: Telemedicine and Predictive Algorithms for the Care and Prevention of Patients with Chronic Heart Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of chronic heart failure (CHF) presents significant challenges in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of exacerbations, and personalized treatment trategies. This paper presents the PrediHealth research project and its preliminary results in the context of heart failure (HF). PrediHealth, conducted in collaboration with a software industry operating in the CPS/IoT fields, aims to address the challenges above by integrating telemedicine, mobile health (m-health) solutions, and predictive analytics into a unified digital healthcare platform. We leveraged an interoperable IoT web-based application, a telemonitoring kit equipped with medical devices and environmental sensors, and AI-driven predictive models to support clinical decision-making. The project follows a structured methodology comprising research on emerging CPS/IoT technologies, system prototyping, predictive model development, and empirical validation within the healthcare ecosystem. Through its innovative AI-enhanced approach, PrediHealth improves patient engagement, reduces hospitalization rates, enhances continuity of care, and lowers healthcare costs.</description>

      <title>POE-$\Delta$: a framework for change engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many organisational problems are addressed through systemic change and re-engineering of existing Information Systems rather than radical new design. In the face of widespread IT project failure, devising effective ways to tackle this type of change remains an open challenge. This work discusses the motivation, theoretical foundation, characteristics and evaluation of a novel framework - referred to as POE-$\Delta$, which is rooted in design and engineering and is aimed at providing systematic support for representing, structuring and exploring change problems of a socio-technical nature, including implementing their solutions when they exist. We generalise an existing framework of greenfield design as problem solving for application to change problems. From a theoretical perspective,POE-$\Delta$ is a strict extension to its parent framework, allowing the seamless integration of greenfield and brownfield design to tackle change problems.
  A Design Science Research methodology was applied over a decade to define and evaluate POE-$\Delta$, with significant case study research conducted to evaluate the framework in its application to real-world change problems of varying criticality and complexity. The results show that POE-$\Delta$ exhibits desirable characteristics of a design approach to organisational change and can bring tangible benefits when applied in practice as a holistic and systematic approach to change in socio-technical contexts.</description>

      <title>Fast Thermal-Aware Chiplet Placement Assisted by Surrogate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of the post-Moore era, the 2.5-D advanced package is a promising solution to sustain the development of very large-scale integrated circuits. However, the thermal placement of chiplet, due to the high complexity of thermal simulation, is very challenging. In this paper, a surrogate-assisted simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to simultaneously minimize both the wirelength and the maximum temperature of integrated chips. To alleviate the computational cost of thermal simulation, a radial basis function network is introduced to approximate the thermal field, assisted by which the simulated annealing algorithm converges to the better placement in less time. Numerical results demonstrate that the surrogate-assisted simulated annealing algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art thermal placement algorithms of chiplet, suggesting its potential application in the agile design of 2.5D package chip.</description>
