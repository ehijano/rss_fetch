      <title>Simplify to Amplify: Achieving Information-Theoretic Bounds with Fewer Steps in Spectral Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a streamlined spectral algorithm for community detection in the two-community stochastic block model (SBM) under constant edge density assumptions. By reducing algorithmic complexity through the elimination of non-essential preprocessing steps, our method directly leverages the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix. We demonstrate that our algorithm exploits specific characteristics of the second eigenvalue to achieve improved error bounds that approach information-theoretic limits, representing a significant improvement over existing methods. Theoretical analysis establishes that our error rates are tighter than previously reported bounds in the literature. Comprehensive experimental validation confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the simplified approach. Our results suggest that algorithmic simplification, rather than increasing complexity, can lead to both computational efficiency and enhanced performance in spectral community detection.</description>

      <title>NTLRAG: Narrative Topic Labels derived with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic modeling has evolved as an important means to identify evident or hidden topics within large collections of text documents. Topic modeling approaches are often used for analyzing and making sense of social media discussions consisting of millions of short text messages. However, assigning meaningful topic labels to document clusters remains challenging, as users are commonly presented with unstructured keyword lists that may not accurately capture the respective core topic. In this paper, we introduce Narrative Topic Labels derived with Retrieval Augmented Generation (NTLRAG), a scalable and extensible framework that generates semantically precise and human-interpretable narrative topic labels. Our narrative topic labels provide a context-rich, intuitive concept to describe topic model output. In particular, NTLRAG uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques and considers multiple retrieval strategies as well as chain-of-thought elements to provide high-quality output. NTLRAG can be combined with any standard topic model to generate, validate, and refine narratives which then serve as narrative topic labels. We evaluated NTLRAG with a user study and three real-world datasets consisting of more than 6.7 million social media messages that have been sent by more than 2.7 million users. The user study involved 16 human evaluators who found that our narrative topic labels offer superior interpretability and usability as compared to traditional keyword lists. An implementation of NTLRAG is publicly available for download.</description>

      <title>Bending the Scaling Law Curve in Large-Scale Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from user interaction history through sequential models has become a cornerstone of large-scale recommender systems. Recent advances in large language models have revealed promising scaling laws, sparking a surge of research into long-sequence modeling and deeper architectures for recommendation tasks. However, many recent approaches rely heavily on cross-attention mechanisms to address the quadratic computational bottleneck in sequential modeling, which can limit the representational power gained from self-attention. We present ULTRA-HSTU, a novel sequential recommendation model developed through end-to-end model and system co-design. By innovating in the design of input sequences, sparse attention mechanisms, and model topology, ULTRA-HSTU achieves substantial improvements in both model quality and efficiency. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ULTRA-HSTU achieves remarkable scaling efficiency gains -- over 5x faster training scaling and 21x faster inference scaling compared to conventional models -- while delivering superior recommendation quality. Our solution is fully deployed at scale, serving billions of users daily and driving significant 4% to 8% consumption and engagement improvements in real-world production environments.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Urban Divide: Adaptive Cross-City Learning for Disaster Sentiment Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms provide a real-time lens into public sentiment during natural disasters; however, models built solely on textual data often reinforce urban-centric biases and overlook underrepresented communities. This paper introduces an adaptive cross-city learning framework that enhances disaster sentiment understanding by integrating mobility-informed behavioral signals and city similarity-based data augmentation. Focusing on the January 2025 Southern California wildfires, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and reveals geographically diverse sentiment patterns, particularly in areas experiencing overlapping fire exposure or delayed emergency responses. We further identify positive correlations between emotional expressions and real-world mobility shifts, underscoring the value of combining behavioral and textual features. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that multimodal fusion and city-aware training significantly improve both accuracy and fairness. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of context-sensitive sentiment modeling and provide actionable insights toward developing more inclusive and equitable disaster response systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Machine Learning based Doubly Robust Estimator for Network Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of inferring causal effects in social network data. This results in challenges due to interference -- where a unit's outcome is affected by neighbors' treatments -- and network-induced confounding factors. While there is extensive literature focusing on estimating causal effects in social network setups, a majority of them make prior assumptions about the form of network-induced confounding mechanisms. Such strong assumptions are rarely likely to hold especially in high-dimensional networks. We propose a novel methodology that combines graph machine learning approaches with the double machine learning framework to enable accurate and efficient estimation of direct and peer effects using a single observational social network. We demonstrate the semiparametric efficiency of our proposed estimator under mild regularity conditions, allowing for consistent uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate that our method is accurate, robust, and scalable via an extensive simulation study. We use our method to investigate the impact of Self-Help Group participation on financial risk tolerance.</description>

      <title>VERA-MH Concept Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Pattern Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability. Our code has been released in https://github.com/antman9914/TGPM.</description>
