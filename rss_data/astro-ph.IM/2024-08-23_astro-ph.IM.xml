      <title>Application of Convolutional Neural Networks to time domain astrophysics. 2D image analysis of OGLE light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the amount of publicly available astronomical data has increased exponentially, with a remarkable example being large scale multiepoch photometric surveys. This wealth of data poses challenges to the classical methodologies commonly employed in the study of variable objects. As a response, deep learning techniques are increasingly being explored to effectively classify, analyze, and interpret these large datasets. In this paper we use two-dimensional histograms to represent Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) phasefolded light curves as images. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify variable objects within eight different categories (from now on labels): Classical Cepheid (CEP), RR Lyrae (RR), Long Period Variable (LPV), Miras (M), Ellipsoidal Binary (ELL), Delta Scuti (DST), Eclipsing Binary (E), and spurious class with Incorrect Periods (Rndm). We set up different training sets to train the same CNN architecture in order to characterize the impact of the training. The training sets were built from the same source of labels but different filters and balancing techniques were applied. Namely: Undersampling (U), Data Augmentation (DA), and Batch Balancing (BB). The best performance was achieved with the BB approach and a training sample size of $\sim$370000 stars. Regarding computational performance, the image representation production rate is of $\sim$76 images per core per second, and the time to predict is $\sim$ 60$\, \mu\text{s}$ per star. The accuracy of the classification improves from $\sim$ 92%, when based only on the CNN, to $\sim$ 98% when the results of the CNN are combined with the period and amplitude features in a two step approach. This methodology achieves comparable results with previous studies but with two main advantages: the identification of miscalculated periods and the improvement in computational time cost.</description>

      <title>An image-based blind search for Fast Radio Bursts in 88 hours of data from the EoR0 Field, with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is part of ongoing efforts to detect Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in a spectral window below 300 MHz. We used an image-based method based on the pilot study of Tingay et al. 2015, scaled up via massively parallel processing using a commercial supercomputer. We searched 87.6 hours of 2-second snapshot images, each covering 1165 square degrees of the EoR0 field, over a dispersion measure range of 170 to 1035 pc cm$^{-3}$. The large amount of data necessitated the construction of a series of filters to classify and reject the large number of false positives. Our search was more sensitive than any previous blind search using the MWA telescope, but we report no FRB detections, a result which is consistent with the extrapolation into the low-frequency domain of the results of Sokolowski et al. (2024). We obtain upper bounds on the event rate ranging from &lt;1783 sky$^{-1}$day$^{-1}$ at a fluence of 392 Jy ms, to &lt;31 sky$^{-1}$day$^{-1}$ at 8400 Jy ms, for our spectral window of 167-198 MHz. Our method was shown to be computationally efficient and scalable by the two or three orders of magnitude required to seriously test the model of Sokolowski et al. Our process is especially sensitive to detections of satellites and meteor trails and may find applications in the identification of these transients. We comment on future surveys using this method, with both the MWA and the SKA.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope Speckle Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Resolution Camera (HRCam) speckle imager at the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research telescope is a highly productive instrument that has accumulated about 40K observations to date. Its performance (detected flux, level of the speckle signal, signal-to-noise ratio, and limiting magnitude) is studied here using both the actual data and realistic simulations, including the detector noise. In the calculation of the speckle power spectrum, signal clipping is essential to reduce the noise impact and maximize the sensitivity. Increasing exposure time of individual frames beyond 30 ms does not improve the limiting magnitude, which ranges from 11.5 to 14 mag under a seeing from 1.6" to 0.6" in the wide-band I filter. A gain of at least one magnitude is expected if the current electron multiplication CCD is replaced by a high-end CMOS detector with a sub-electron readout noise. This study will help in planning, executing, and automating future speckle observations with HRCam and other speckle imagers.</description>

      <title>Performance estimation of photonic integrated wavefront corrector for single-mode fiber coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern astronomical instruments rely on the optimal coupling of starlight into single-mode fibers (SMFs). For ground-based telescopes, this coupling is limited by atmospheric turbulence. We propose an integrated wavefront corrector based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonics, which samples the aberrated wavefront via a microlens array (MLA). The MLA focuses the sampled wavefront onto an array of grating couplers that inject the beamlets into the single-mode waveguides of the corrector. The beams in each waveguide are then shifted in phase using thermo-optic phase shifters before combining the co-phased beams into one single-mode waveguide. In this work, we analyze the external factors that we anticipate will impact the performance of the corrector. Specifically, we study the effects of the telescope pupil function with obscuration, determine whether the corrector requires tip/tilt pre-correction, and analyze the impact of scintillation on the correction quality.</description>

      <title>RIS-Vis: A Novel Visualization Platform for Seismic, Geodetic, and Weather Data Relevant to Antarctic Cryosphere Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antarctic ice shelves play a vital role in preserving the physical conditions of the Antarctic cryosphere and the Southern Ocean, and beyond. By serving as a buttressing force, ice shelves prevent sea-level rise by restraining the flow of continental ice and glaciers to the sea. Sea-level rise impacts the global environment in multiple ways, including flooding habitats, eroding coastlines, and contaminating soil and groundwater. It is therefore essential to monitor the stability of Antarctic ice shelves, for which a variety of complementary data sources is required. We have developed RIS-Vis, a novel data visualization platform to monitor Antarctic ice shelves. Although focused on the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), RIS-Vis could be readily scaled to monitor other ice shelves around Antarctica, and elsewhere. Currently, RIS-Vis is capable of analyzing and visualizing seismic, geodetic, and weather data to provide meaningful information for Antarctic cryosphere research. RIS-Vis was built using Python libraries including Obspy, APScheduler, and the Plotly Dash framework, and uses SQLite as the backing database. Visualizations developed on RIS-Vis include filtered seismic waveforms, spectrograms, and power spectral densities, geodetic-based ice-shelf flow, and meteorological variables such as atmospheric temperature and pressure. The dashboard visualization platform abstracts away the time-intensive analysis process of raw data and allows scientists to better concentrate on RIS science.</description>

      <title>Full non-LTE spectral line formation III. The case of a two-level atom with broadened upper level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider the full nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiation transfer problem. This formalism allows us to account for deviation from equilibrium distribution of both the radiation field and the massive particles. In the present study two-level atoms with broadened upper level represent the massive particles. In the absence of velocity-changing collisions, we demonstrate the analytic equivalence of the full non-LTE source function with the corresponding standard non-LTE partial frequency redistribution (PFR) model. We present an iterative method based on operator splitting techniques to numerically solve the problem at hand. We benchmark it against the standard non-LTE transfer problem for a two-level atom with PFR. We illustrate the deviation of the velocity distribution function of excited atoms from the equilibrium distribution. We also discuss the dependence of the emission profile and the velocity distribution function on elastic collisions and velocity-changing collisions.</description>

      <title>Expected Impact of Rubin Observatory LSST on NEO Follow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate and analyse the contribution of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to the rate of discovery of Near Earth Object (NEO) candidates, their submission rates to the NEO Confirmation page (NEOCP), and the resulting demands on the worldwide NEO follow-up observation system. We find that, when using current NEOCP listing criteria, Rubin will typically contribute ~129 new objects to the NEOCP each night in the first year, an increase of ~8x relative to present day. Only 8.3% of the objects listed for follow-up will be NEOs, with the primary contaminant being a background of yet undiscovered, faint, main belt asteroids (MBAs). We consider follow-up prioritisation strategies to lessen the impact on the NEO follow-up system. We develop an algorithm that predicts (with 68% accuracy) whether Rubin itself will self recover any given tracklet; external follow-up of such candidates can be de-prioritised. With this algorithm enabled, the follow-up list would be reduced to 64 NEO candidates per night (with ~8.4% purity). We propose additional criteria based on trailing, apparent magnitude, and ecliptic latitude to further prioritise follow-up. We hope observation planners and brokers will adopt some of these open-source algorithms, enabling the follow-up community to effectively keep up with the NEOCP in the early years of LSST.</description>

      <title>The AIRI plug-and-play algorithm for image reconstruction in radio-interferometry: variations and robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms are appealing alternatives to proximal algorithms when solving inverse imaging problems. By learning a Deep Neural Network (DNN) denoiser behaving as a proximal operator, one waives the computational complexity of optimisation algorithms induced by sophisticated image priors, and the sub-optimality of handcrafted priors compared to DNNs. Such features are highly desirable in radio-interferometric (RI) imaging, where precision and scalability of the image reconstruction process are key. In previous work, we introduced AIRI, PnP counterpart to the unconstrained variant of the SARA optimisation algorithm, relying on a forward-backward algorithmic backbone. Here, we introduce variations of AIRI towards a more general and robust PnP paradigm in RI imaging. Firstly, we show that the AIRI denoisers can be used without any alteration to instantiate a PnP counterpart to the constrained SARA optimisation algorithm itself, relying on a primal-dual forward-backward algorithmic backbone, thus extending the remit of the AIRI paradigm. Secondly, we show that AIRI algorithms are robust to strong variations in the nature of the training dataset, with denoisers trained on medical images yielding similar reconstruction quality to those trained on astronomical images. Thirdly, we develop a functionality to quantify the model uncertainty introduced by the randomness in the training process. We validate the image reconstruction and uncertainty quantification functionality of AIRI algorithms against the SARA family and CLEAN, both in simulation and on real data of the ESO 137-006 galaxy acquired with the MeerKAT telescope. AIRI code is available in the BASPLib code library on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Next Generation LLRF Control Platform for Compact C-band Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Low-Level RF (LLRF) control circuits of linear accelerators (LINACs) are conventionally realized with heterodyne based architectures, which have analog RF mixers for up and down conversion with discrete data converters. We have developed a new LLRF platform for C-band linear accelerator based on the Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) device from AMD Xilinx. The integrated data converters in the RFSoC can directly sample the RF signals in C-band and perform the up and down mixing digitally. The programmable logic and processors required for signal processing for the LLRF control system are also included in a single RFSoC chip. With all the essential components integrated in a device, the RFSoC-based LLRF control platform can be implemented more cost-effectively and compactly, which can be applied to a broad range of accelerator applications. In this paper, the structure and configuration of the newly developed LLRF platform will be described. The LLRF prototype has been tested with high power test setup with a Cool Cooper Collider (C\(^3\)) accelerating structure. The LLRF and the solid state amplifier (SSA) loopback setup demonstrated phase jitter in 1 s as low as 115 fs, which is lower than the requirement of C\(^3\). The rf signals from the klystron forward and accelerating structure captured with peak power up to 16.45 MW will be presented and discussed.</description>
