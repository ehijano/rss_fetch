      <title>Inducing localized solutions via interaction in a self-defocusing system with localized pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of induced localized coupled modes in passive cavities with both loss and gain. Our model is based on linearly coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations, where a Gaussian pump beam is applied to only one mode. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that self-defocusing systems can support the formation of localized stationary modes in the partner field. The characteristics of these induced modes are determined by key parameters, including coupling strength, cavity decay rate, detuning effects, and the pump beam's intensity and width.</description>

      <title>Individual particle persistence antagonizes global ordering in populations of nematically-aligning self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from individual to collective motion plays a significant role in many biological processes. While the implications of different types of particle-particle interactions for the emergence of particular modes of collective motion have been well studied, it is unclear how particular types of individual migration patterns influence collective motion. Here, motivated by swarming bacteria Myxococcus xanthus, we investigate the combined effects of the individual pattern of migration and of particle-particle interactions, on the emergence of collective migration. We analyze the effects of a feature of individual pattern migration, the persistence of motion, on the collective properties of the system that emerge from interactions among individuals; in particular, when nematic velocity alignment interaction mediates collective dynamics. We find, through computer simulations and mathematical analysis, that an initially disordered migratory state can become globally ordered by increasing either, the particle-particle alignment interaction strength or the persistence of individual migration. In contrast, we find that persistence prevents the emergence of global nematic order when both persistence and nematic alignment are comparatively high. We conclude that behavior at the population level does not only depend on interactions between individuals but also on the individuals' own intrinsic behavior.</description>

      <title>Effects of fractional diffraction on nonlinear PT phase transitions and stability of dark solitons and vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave propagation under the action of fractional diffraction has recently drawn increasing attention in nonlinear optics. Here, we address the effect of fractional diffraction on the existence, phase transitions, and stability of dark solitons (DSs) and vortices in parity-time (PT) symmetric graded-index waveguide with self-defocusing nonlinearity. The DSs and vortices are produced by numerical solution of the corresponding one- and two-dimensional fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We show that solution branches of fundamental and higher-order DSs collide pair-wise (merge) and disappear with the increase of the gain-loss strength, revealing nonlinear PT phase transitions in the waveguide. Numerically identifying the merger points, we demonstrate effects of the fractional diffraction on the phase transition.The phase transition points determine boundaries of existence regions for the DSs and vortices.The stability of the DSs and vortices is studied by means of the linearization with respect to small perturbations. Direct simulations of perturbed evolution corroborate their stability properties predicted by the analysis of small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Optical pattern formation in self-focusing and self-defocusing diffractively thick media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atomic clouds constitute highly resonant nonlinear optical media, whose refractive index can be easily tuned via the light frequency. When subjected to a retro-reflected laser beam and under appropriate conditions, the cloud undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking and spatial patterns develop in the transverse cross-section of the beam. We investigate the impact of the sign of the light detuning from the atomic resonance on these patterns, thus directly comparing pattern formation for self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities. Our observations emphasize the need for a ''diffractively thick'' medium description of the light-cloud interaction, where diffraction and nonlinear propagation inside the sample are taken into account.</description>
