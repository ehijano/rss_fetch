      <title>Prime Factorization in Models of PV$_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that no family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits can factorize a constant fraction of all products of two $n$-bit primes, we show that the bounded arithmetic theory $\text{PV}_1$, even when augumented by the sharply bounded choice scheme $BB(\Sigma^b_0)$, cannot prove that every number has some prime divisor. By the completeness theorem, it follows that under this assumption there is a model $M$ of $\text{PV}_1$ that contains a nonstandard number $m$ which has no prime factorization.</description>

      <title>Categorial grammars with unique category assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A categorial grammar assigns one of several syntactic categories to each symbol of the alphabet, and the category of a string is then deduced from the categories assigned to its symbols using two simple reduction rules. This paper investigates a special class of categorial grammars, in which only one category is assigned to each symbol, thus eliminating ambiguity on the lexical level (in linguistic terms, a unique part of speech is assigned to each word). While unrestricted categorial grammars are equivalent to the context-free grammars, the proposed subclass initially appears weak, as it cannot define even some regular languages. It is proved in the paper that it is actually powerful enough to define a homomorphic encoding of every context-free language, in the sense that for every context-free language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ there is a language $L'$ over some alphabet $\Omega$ defined by categorial grammar with unique category assignment and a homomorphism $h \colon \Sigma \to \Omega^+$, such that a string $w$ is in $L$ if and only if $h(w)$ is in $L'$. In particular, in Greibach's hardest context-free language theorem, it is sufficient to use a hardest language defined by a categorial grammar with unique category assignment.</description>

      <title>Subshifts on groups and computable analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of subshifts on groups different from $\mathbb{Z}$, such as $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, has been a subject of intense research in recent years. These investigations have unveiled aremarkable connection between dynamics and recursion theory. Different questions about the dynamics of these systems have been answered in recursion-theoretical terms. In this work we further explore this connection. We use the framework of computable analysis to explore the class of effective dynamical systems on metric spaces, and relate these systems to subshifts of finite type (SFTs) on groups. We prove that every effective dynamical system on a general metric space is the topological factor of an effective dynamical system with topological dimension zero. We combine this result with existing simulation results to obtain new examples of systems that are factors of SFTsWe also study a conjugacy invariant for subshifts on groups called Medvedev degree. This invariant is a complexity measure of algorithmic nature. We develop the basic theory of these degrees for subshifts on arbitrary finitely generated groups. Using these tools we are able to classify the values that this invariant attains for SFTs and other classes of subshifts on several groups. Furthermore, we establish a connection between these degrees and the distribution of isolated points in the space of all subshifts. Motivated by the study of Medvedev degrees of subshifts, we also consider translation-like actions of groups on graphs. We prove that every connected, locally finite, and infinite graph admits a translation by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be chosen transitive exactly when the graph has one or two ends. This generalizes a result of Seward about translation-like actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ on finitely generated groups.</description>

      <title>Approximability of deep equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a structural framework for computations involving floating-point operations.Informed by real-valued logic, we introduce deep computations (ultracomputations) and deep iterates, formalizing the ideas of "asymptotic limit" of computations and compositional iterates, respectively.
  As an application of this framework, we prove the existence of deep equilibria, which hitherto have been found only empirically (yielding remarkable memory savings in deep learning). Our proof of existence of deep equilibria is based on the concept of idempotent ultrafilter from combinatorics and inspired by the notion of indiscernibility from model theory.
  We study and characterize deep computations (and hence deep equilibria) that are bona fide computable, i.e., uniformly approximable by a priori given computable primitive real-valued functions. Informed by model theory of real-valued structures, as well as Cp-theory from topology, we use a classical result of Grothendieck to characterize computability of deep computations in terms of continuous extendibility.
  Our framework does not impose a priori uniform/global bounds on real-valued quantities; therefore, our structures yield non-compact types spaces. Such type spaces require a more nuanced topological treatment than compact ones arising in model theory of [0,1]-valued structures.</description>

      <title>Sharp o-minimality and lattice point counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be a lattice and let $Z\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ be a definable family in an o-minimal expansion of the real field, $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. A result of Barroero and Widmer gives sharp estimates for the number of lattice points in the fibers $Z_T=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:(T,x)\in Z\}$. Here we give an effective version of this result for a family definable in a sharply o-minimal structure expanding $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. We also give an effective version of the Barroero and Widmer statement for certain sets definable in $\mathbb{R}_{\exp}$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures arising from the finite condensation on linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite condensation $\sim_F$ is an equivalence relation defined on a linear order $L$ by $x \sim_F y$ if and only if the set of points lying between $x$ and $y$ is finite. We define an operation $\cdot_F$ on linear orders $L$ and $M$ by $L \cdot_F M = \operatorname{o.t.}\left((LM)/\!\sim_F\right)$; that is, $L \cdot_F M$ is the order type of the lexicographic product of $L$ and $M$ modulo the finite condensation. The infinite order types $L$ such that $L / \! \sim_F\, \cong 1$ are $\omega, \omega^*,$ and $\zeta$ (where $\omega^*$ is the reverse ordering of $\omega$, and $\zeta$ is the order type of $\mathbb{Z}$). We show that under the operation $\cdot_F$, the set $R=\{1, \omega, \omega^*, \zeta\}$ forms a left rectangular band. Further, each of the ordinal elements of $R$ defines, via left or right multiplication modulo the finite condensation, a weakly order-preserving map on the class of ordinals. We study these maps' effect on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form. In particular, we examine the extent to which one of these maps, sending $\alpha$ to the order type of $\alpha$ modulo the finite condensation, behaves similarly to a derivative operator on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form.</description>

      <title>The Ziegler spectrum for enriched ringoids and schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ziegler spectrum for categories enriched in closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck categories is defined and studied in this paper. It recovers the classical Ziegler spectrum of a ring. As an application, the Ziegler spectrum as well as the category of generalised quasi-coherent sheaves of a reasonable scheme is introduced and studied. It is shown that there is a closed embedding of the injective spectrum of a coherent scheme endowed with the tensor fl-topology (respectively of a noetherian scheme endowed with the dual Zariski topology) into its Ziegler spectrum. It is also shown that quasi-coherent sheaves and generalised quasi-coherent sheaves are related to each other by a recollement.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Exponentiation in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two seemingly different definitions of constructive ordinal exponentiation, where an ordinal is taken to be a transitive, extensional, and wellfounded order on a set. The first definition is abstract, uses suprema of ordinals, and is solely motivated by the expected equations. The second is more concrete, based on decreasing lists, and can be seen as a constructive version of a classical construction by Sierpi{\'n}ski based on functions with finite support. We show that our two approaches are equivalent (whenever it makes sense to ask the question), and use this equivalence to prove algebraic laws and decidability properties of the exponential. Our work takes place in the framework of homotopy type theory, and all results are formalized in the proof assistant Agda.</description>
