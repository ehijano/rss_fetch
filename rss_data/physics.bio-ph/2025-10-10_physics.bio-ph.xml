      <title>Confinement reduces surface accumulation of swimming bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many swimming bacteria naturally inhabit confined environments, yet how confinement influences their swimming behaviors remains unclear. Here, we combine experiments, continuum modeling and particle-based simulations to investigate near-surface bacterial swimming in dilute suspensions under varying confinement. Confinement reduces near-surface accumulation and facilitates bacterial escape. These effects are quantitatively captured by models incorporating the force quadrupole, a higher-order hydrodynamic singularity, that generates a rotational flow reorienting bacteria away from surfaces. Under strong confinement, bacterial trajectories straighten due to the balancing torques exerted by opposing surfaces. These findings highlight the role of hydrodynamic quadrupole interactions in near-surface bacterial motility, with implications for microbial ecology, infection control, and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous proteinaceous shells with octagonal local order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteinaceous shells useful for various biomedical applications exhibit a wide range of anomalous structures that are fundamentally different from icosahedral viral capsids described by the Caspar-Klug paradigmatic model. Exploring the Protein Data Bank, we have identified nine different types of anomalous shells structurally close to flat octagonal quasicrystals. As we show, these numerous shells have cubic nets cut from short-period approximants of an octagonal tiling composed of square and rhombic tiles. The approximants and parent tiling are easily obtained within the Landau density wave approach, while the nonequilibrium assembly of them can be simulated using the pair potentials derived from critical density waves. Gluing a polyhedron net and mapping it onto a spherical surface induces tile distortions, and to reduce them, we introduce and minimize the effective elastic energy of the system. Thus, we return quasi-equivalence to previously equivalent tiles. Possible cubic faceting of the octagonal spherical tilings is discussed in terms of the topological charge distribution over the tiling vertices. The proposed structural models describe numerous proteinaceous shells including about half of the known symmetrical enzymes. Our results constitute a fundamental basis for further applications of identified octagonal assemblies and can help to discover and study similar systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of individual active elastic filaments with chiral self-propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the over-damped dynamics of individual one-dimensional elastic filaments subjected to a chiral active force which propels each point of the filament at a fixed angle relative to the tangent vector of the filament at that point. Such a model is a reasonable starting point for describing the behavior of polymers such as microtubules in gliding assay experiments. We derive sixth-order nonlinear coupled partial differential equations for the intrinsic properties of the filament, namely, its curvature and metric, and show that these equations are capable of supporting multiple different stationary solutions in a co-moving frame, i.e. that chiral active elastic filaments exhibit dynamic multi-stability in their shapes. A linear stability analysis of these solutions is carried out to determine which solutions are stable and a brief analysis of the time-dependent approach to stationary shape is considered. Finally, simulations are presented which confirm many of our predictions while also revealing additional complexity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Models of Neuronal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal circuits arise as axons and dendrites extend, navigate, and connect to target cells. Axonal growth, in particular, integrates deterministic guidance from substrate mechanics and geometry with stochastic fluctuations generated by signaling, molecular detection, cytoskeletal assembly, and growth cone dynamics. A comprehensive quantitative description of this process remains incomplete. We review stochastic models in which Langevin dynamics and the associates Fokker-Planck equation capture axonal motion and turning under combined biases and noise. Paired with experiments, these models yield key parameters, including effective diffusion (motility) coefficients, speed and angle distributions, mean-square displacement, and mechanical measures of cell-substrate coupling, thereby linking single-cell biophysics and intercellular interactions to collective growth statistics and network formation. We further couple the Fokker-Planck description to a mechanochemical actin-myosin-clutch model and perform a linear stability analysis of the resulting dynamics. Routh--Hurwitz criteria identify regimes of steady extension, damped oscillations, and Hopf bifurcations that generate sustained limit cycles. Together, these results clarify the mechanisms that govern axonal guidance and connectivity and inform the design of engineered substrates and neuroprosthetic scaffolds aimed at enhancing nerve repair and regeneration.</description>

      <title>ITRUSST Consensus on Biophysical Safety for Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging technology for non-invasive brain stimulation. The International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards consortium (ITRUSST) has established consensus on considerations for nonsignificant biophysical risk of TUS, drawing upon the literature and established regulations for biomedical devices. Here, we assume the application of TUS to individuals without contraindications, compromised thermoregulation, vascular vulnerabilities, or administered ultrasound contrast agents. In this context, we present a concise yet comprehensive set of levels for nonsignificant risks of TUS application. For mechanical effects, it is non-significant risk if the mechanical index (MI) or the mechanical index for transcranial application (MItc) does not exceed 1.9. For thermal effects, it is non-significant risk if any of the following three levels are met: the peak temperature rise does not exceed 2{\deg}C or the peak absolute temperature does not exceed 39{\deg}C, assuming a baseline temperature of 37{\deg}C, the thermal dose does not exceed 2 CEM43 in brain tissue, 16 CEM43 in bone tissue, and 21 CEM43 in skin tissue, or specific values of the thermal index (TI) for a given exposure time. This report reflects a consensus expert opinion and can inform, but not replace, regulatory guidelines or official international standards. Similarly, this consensus can inform, but not replace, ethical evaluation, which weighs the total burden, risks, and benefits of the proposed action. The stated levels are not safety limits per se, and further data is needed to establish the threshold for significant risk. We review literature relevant to our considerations and discuss limitations and future developments of our approach.</description>

      <title>GTP before ATP: The energy currency at the origin of genes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Life is an exergonic chemical reaction. Many individual reactions in metabolism entail slightly endergonic steps that are coupled to free energy release, typically as ATP hydrolysis, in order to go forward. ATP is almost always supplied by the rotor-stator ATP synthase, which harnesses chemiosmotic ion gradients. Because the ATP synthase is a protein, it arose after the ribosome did. What was the energy currency of metabolism before the origin of the ATP synthase and how (and why) did ATP come to be the universal energy currency? About 27% of a cell's energy budget is consumed as GTP during translation. The universality of GTP-dependence in ribosome function indicates that GTP was the ancestral energy currency of protein synthesis. The use of GTP in translation and ATP in small molecule synthesis are conserved across all lineages, representing energetic compartments that arose in the last universal common ancestor, LUCA. And what came before GTP? Recent findings indicate that the energy supporting the origin of LUCA's metabolism stemmed from H2-dependent CO2 reduction along routes that strongly resemble the reactions and transition metal catalysts of the acetyl-CoA pathway.</description>

      <title>Panoramic Voltage-Sensitive Optical Mapping of Contracting Hearts using Cooperative Multi-View Motion Tracking with 12 to 24 Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voltage-sensitive fluorescence imaging is widely used to image action potential waves in the heart. However, while the electrical waves trigger mechanical contraction, imaging needs to be performed with pharmacologically contraction-inhibited hearts, limiting studies of the coupling between cardiac electrophysiology and tissue mechanics. Here, we introduce a high-resolution multi-camera optical mapping system with which we image action potential waves at high resolutions across the entire ventricular surface of the beating and strongly deforming heart. We imaged intact isolated rabbit hearts inside a soccer-ball shaped imaging chamber facilitating even illumination and panoramic imaging. Using 12 high-speed cameras, ratiometric voltage-sensitive imaging, and three-dimensional (3D) multi-view motion tracking, we reconstructed the entire 3D deforming ventricular surface and performed corresponding voltage-sensitive measurements during sinus rhythm, paced rhythm, and ventricular fibrillation. Our imaging setup defines a new state-of-the-art in the field and can be used to study the heart's electromechanical physiology during health and disease at unprecedented resolutions. For instance, we measured electrical activation times and observed mechanical strain waves following electrical activation fronts during pacing, observed electromechanical vortices during ventricular fibrillation, and measured action potential duration and contractile changes in response to pharmacological blockage of potassium ion channels.</description>

      <title>Topological phases in discrete stochastic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</description>

      <title>Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking into account the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layers redistributes and generates destabilizing Maxwell stress on the membrane, which outweighs the stabilizing contribution from the electrical body force, leading to a net destabilizing effect. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.</description>

      <title>Controlling energy delivery with bistable nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Countless biological processes are fueled by energy-rich molecules like ATP and GTP that supply energy with extreme efficiency. However, designing similar energy-delivery schemes from the bottom up, essential for the development of powered nanostructures and other {\it de novo} machinery, presents a significant challenge: how can an energy-rich structure be stable in solution yet still deliver this energy at precisely the right time? In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.</description>
