      <title>The F. John model and Cummins' equations for freely floating objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the well-posedness theory of F. John's problem for freely floating objects in a two-dimensional framework. This problem is a linear description of the interactions between an incompressible, irrotational free-surface fluid and a partially immersed solid object. It is related to the Cummins equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations widely used by naval engineers. Our results provide a rigorous justification of this model and the first proof of its well-posedness. To this end, we show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure, albeit with a non-definite Hamiltonian which compels us to work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. The presence of corners in the fluid domain also induces a lack of elliptic regularity for the boundary value problem satisfied by the velocity potential. This is why the solution to F. John's problem has in general a limited regularity, even with very smooth initial data. Correspondingly, the solution to Cummins' equation is in general no better than $C^3$. We demonstrate higher regularity when the contact angles are small or equal to $\pi/2$, provided that some compatibility conditions, propagated by the flow, are satisfied. This allows us to exhibit qualitative differences between the three degrees of freedom of the object. For instance, the motion of an object allowed to move only vertically can be $C^\infty$, while it cannot be better than $C^3$ if it is only allowed to translate horizontally.</description>

      <title>Fully localised three-dimensional solitary water waves on Beltrami flows with strong surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully localised three-dimensional solitary waves are steady water waves which are evanescent in every horizontal direction. This paper presents an existence theory for such waves under the assumptions that the relative vorticity and velocity fields are parallel (`Beltrami flows'), that the free surface of the water takes the form $\{z=\eta(x,y)\}$ for some function $\eta: {\mathbb R}^2\rightarrow{\mathbb R}$, and that the influence of surface tension is sufficiently strong. The governing equations are formulated as a single equation for $\eta$, which is then reduced to a perturbation of the KP-I equation. This equation has recently been shown to have a family of nondegenerate localised solutions, and an application of a suitable variant of the implicit-function theorem shows that they persist under perturbations.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic dynamics for the $L^2$-supercritical gKDV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L^2$-supercritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation (gKdV) with nonlinearities $p&gt;5$. While local well-posedness in $H^1$ is classical, the long-time dynamics in the supercritical regime remains largely unexplored beyond small data global solutions, the construction of multi-solitons for any power and self-similar blow-up near the critical power $p=5$. We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux. This yields quantitative versions of decay phenomena previously known only in subcritical settings, and it applies without any smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with Rabi frequency (II): The De Giorgi conjecture for the nonlocal problem in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type.
  In the present (second) paper of the series, we focus on the nonlocal problem of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}
  (-\Delta)^{s}u+u(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+v(\alpha uv-\omega)=0,
  (-\Delta)^{s}v+v(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+u(\alpha uv-\omega)=0,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  which models the stationary states of Rabi-coupled condensates with inter- and intra-species interactions.
  We prove that for $\frac{1}{2}\le s&lt;1$, any positive entire solution $(u,v)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying the monotonicity condition $\partial_{x_3}u&gt;0&gt;\partial_{x_3}v$ must be one-dimensional. Moreover, when $0&lt;s&lt;\frac{1}{2}$, the same conclusion holds for monotone solutions in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  Our work generalizes classical De Giorgi-type theorems to a new class of nonlocal coupled systems and, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first Liouville-type classification of monotone solutions for Rabi-coupled fractional Bose-Einstein condensates, with particular emphasis on fractional Gross-Pitaevskii models.</description>

      <title>An analytic study of bi-harmonic flow with a forcing term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of smooth, closed planar curves under a fourth order biharmonic flow with an external forcing term. Such flows arise naturally in the theory of biharmonic maps and geometric variational problems involving bending energy. We first establish the global existence of smooth solutions to the associated initial value problem, assuming appropriate conditions on the forcing term. The analysis is performed through a reformulation of the geometric flow using the support function, enabling a scalar PDE characterization of the evolution. Under specific geometric constraints, we demonstrate that the governing equation admits a Monge Amp\'ere type structure that can exhibit hyperbolic behavior. Furthermore, we prove that convexity is preserved during the evolution and derive sufficient conditions ensuring long time convergence to steady-state solutions. Our results extend recent developments in geometric analysis by clarifying the role of forcing terms in stabilizing high order curvature flows and enhancing their qualitative behavior.</description>

      <title>Distortion of charge distribution due to internal electric fields described by the drift-diffusion semiconductor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the initial value problem for the Debye--Hueckel drift-diffusion equation is studied. This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.</description>

      <title>Classification and symmetry of global solutions for nonlinear elliptic equations with mixed reaction terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the set of all positive distributional $C^1(\mathbb R^N\setminus \{0\})$-solutions of elliptic equations with mixed reaction terms of the form $$ \mathbb L_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}[u]:= \Delta u-(N-2+2\rho) \frac{x\cdot \nabla u}{|x|^2} +\lambda \frac{u^\tau |\nabla u|^{1-\tau}}{|x|^{1+\tau}}=|x|^\theta u^q\quad \mbox{in } \mathbb R^N\setminus \{0\}, $$ where $\rho,\lambda, \theta\in \mathbb R$ are arbitrary, $N\geq 2$, $q&gt;1$ and $\tau\in [0,1)$. Defining $\beta=(\theta+2)/(q-1)$ and $f_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}(t)=t\left(t+2\rho\right) +\lambda |t|^{1-\tau}$ for $t\in \mathbb R$, we show that the equation has positive solutions if and only if $f_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}(\beta)&gt;0$. Under this condition, we provide existence and the exact asymptotic behaviour near zero and at infinity for all positive solutions. We obtain that all such solutions are radially symmetric. When $\theta&lt;-2$ and $\rho,\lambda\in \mathbb R$, we also find the precise local behaviour near zero for all positive solutions of our equation in $\Omega\setminus \{0\}$, where $\Omega$ is an open set containing $0$. By introducing the second term in $\mathbb L_{\rho,\lambda,\tau}[\cdot]$ with $\rho\in \mathbb R$, we reduce the study to $\theta&lt;-2$ via a modified Kelvin transform. We reveal new and surprising phenomena compared with the work of C\^{\i}rstea and F\u{a}rc\u{a}\c{s}eanu (2021), where $\rho=(2-N)/2$ and $\tau=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-dimensional differential algebraic equations (short DAEs) with input and output are studied. The concepts of operator nodes and system nodes are extended to systems which additionally may include algebraic constraints. Extrapolation spaces are investigated for differential-algebraic equations, and solutions of the extrapolated DAE are characterized using augmented Wong sequences. The resulting theory is then applied to characterize infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian DAEs.</description>

      <title>Stability and bifurcation of 2D viscous primitive equations with full diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability and bifurcation of the two-dimensional viscous primitive equations with full diffusion under thermal forcing. The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 &lt; T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 &gt; T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows.</description>

      <title>Local wellposedness of the 2d Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the local wellposedness of a general Gross-Pitaevskii equation with rough potential is proven in dimension 2. The class of rough potentials we are considering is large enough to contain the spatial white noise and thus a renormalization procedure may be needed. We first construct the associated Schr\"odinger operator from its quadratic form. Then, the regularity of elements of its domain is explored. This allows to use a paracontrolled approach in order to obtain Strichartz estimates, which are used to prove the local wellposedness by a contraction argument.</description>

      <title>Isolated singularities for elliptic equations with convolution terms in a punctured ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, we investigate the inequality $$ -\Delta u+V(x) u\geq f\quad\mbox{ in } B_1\setminus\{0\}\subset \mathbb{R}^N , N \geq 2, $$ where $f\in L^1_{loc}(B_1)$. If $V\geq 0$ is radially symmetric, we provide optimal conditions for which any solution $0\leq u\in \mathcal{C}^2(B_1\setminus\{0\})$ of the above inequality satisfies $u, \Delta u, V(x)u\in L^1_{loc}(B_1)$. This extends a result of H. Brezis and P.-L. Lions (1982), originally established for constant potentials $V$. Second, we investigate the equation $$\displaystyle -\Delta u + \lambda V(x) u = (K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p) u^q \quad\text{in } B_1 \setminus \{0\},$$ where $0\leq V\in \mathcal{C}^{0, \nu}( \overline B_1\setminus\{0\})$, $0&lt;\nu&lt;1$, $\lambda, p, q&gt;0$ and $$K_{\alpha, \beta}(x) = |x|^{-\alpha}\log^{\beta}\frac{2e}{|x|}, \quad\text{where } 0 \leq \alpha &lt; N, \beta \in \mathbb{R}.$$ For $N \geq 3$, we establish sharp conditions on the exponents $\alpha, \beta, p, q$ under which singular solutions exist and exhibit the asymptotic behavior $u(x) \simeq |x|^{2-N}$ near the origin. For $N = 2$, we provide a classification of the existence and boundedness of solutions based on the local behavior of the potential $V(x)$ near the origin.</description>

      <title>The incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell two-fluid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this text, the filtering unitary group method developed, among others, by S. Schochet is adapted to prove the existence and well-posedness of modulation equations describing the incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell Two-Fluid (EMTF) system. The reduced model captures up to the ion and electron skin depths the long-time behavior of solutions near a constant neutral background with non-zero densities. In the prepared case, the solutions of our asymptotic equations are in one-to-one correspondence with those of incompressible eXtended MagnetoHyDrodynamics (XMHD), hence providing a new basis to the XMHD framework which is currently being studied by physicists through Hamiltonian methods, see P.J. Morrison et al. By this way, we can give a simplified access to many plasma phenomena such as (a form of two-fluid) turbulence, Hall and inertial effects, as well as collisionless magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity and a priori estimates for fractional equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundary H\"older regularity for solutions to the fractional Dirichlet problem in unbounded domains with boundary \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  (-\Delta)^s u(x) = g(x),&amp;\text{in } \Omega,
  u(x)=0, &amp;\text{in } \Omega^c.
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*} Existing results rely on the global $L^{\infty}$ norm of solutions to control their boundary $C^s$ norm, which is insufficient for blow-up and rescaling analysis to obtain a priori estimates in unbounded domains. To overcome this limitation, we first derive a local version of boundary H\"older regularity for nonnegative solutions in which we replace the global $L^{\infty}$ norm by only a local $L^{\infty}$ norm. Then as an important application, we establish a priori estimates for nonnegative solutions to a family of nonlinear equations on unbounded domains with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Feynman spectral action of the wave operator on asymptotically de Sitter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the wave operator $\square_g$ on non-trapping (at all energies) even asymptotically de Sitter spaces. We construct a Feynman operator on the conformal extension of asymptotically de Sitter spaces and give a proof of uniform microlocal estimates for the Feynman operator in this setting. This enables the study of the Lorentzian "spectral" zeta functions in asymptotically de Sitter and the construction of a "spectral" action of the Feynman propagator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove semiglobal stabilization and exact controllability results for nonlinear plate equations with hinged boundary conditions and analytic nonlinearity. These results hold when the damping or control is localized in a region where observability for the linear Schr\"odinger equation is known to hold. At the core of these results lies a new unique continuation property for the nonlinear plate equation, which significantly relaxes the geometric conditions required for such property to hold. This property is obtained by combining recent results on propagation of analyticity in time and unique continuation for linear plate operators. More broadly, our approach exploits the linear observability of the plate equation to establish both stabilization and control results. First, we prove exponential decay of the nonlinear energy under a defocusing assumption on the nonlinearity. Second, under a weaker asymptotic assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove semiglobal exact control by analyzing control properties inside the compact attractor provided by the dynamics of the damped equation.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate inflation of Fourier--Lebesgue norms for solutions to the focusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation posed on the real line. For $p\neq 2$ and all $s\in \mathbb{R}$, we construct a sequence of solutions $u_n$ whose initial data $u_n(0)$ converges to zero in the Fourier--Lebesgue spaces $\mathcal F L^p_s(\mathbb{R})$, but whose evolutions at later times $t_n$ diverge to infinity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a class of recursive distributional equations including the resistance of the series-parallel graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a class of recursive distributional equations (RDE's) proposed by Gurel-Gurevich [17] and involving a bias parameter $p$, which includes the logarithm of the resistance of the series-parallel graph. A discrete-time evolution equation resembling a nonlinear, fractional Fisher-KPP equation is derived to describe the CDF's of solutions. When the bias parameter $p = \frac{1}{2}$, this equation is shown to have a PDE scaling limit, from which distributional limit theorems for the RDE are derived. Applied to the series-parallel graph, the results imply that $N^{-1/3} \log R^{(N)}$ has a nondegenerate limit when $p = \frac{1}{2}$, as conjectured by Addario-Berry, Cairns, Devroye, Kerriou, and Mitchell [1].</description>

      <title>Survival and invasion dynamics in cell populations: an analytical framework for threshold behaviour in nonlinear age-structured models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.
  We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed.</description>

      <title>On gap properties for the linearized 1D Dirac--Soler model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of the Dirac operator $L_0$ arising as the upper-right off-diagonal block in the linearization around standing wave solutions of the one-dimensional Soler model with power nonlinearity $f(s)=s|s|^{p-1}$, $p&gt;0$. Our main results concern the so-called gap property: we show that if $p \geq 1$, then the only eigenvalues of $L_0$ are its ground state energies, $-2\omega$ and $0$. In contrast, for $p&lt;1$, additional eigenvalues appear from the thresholds of the essential spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that the thresholds never admit eigenvalues and that they have at most one resonance.</description>

      <title>Near invariance of quasi-energy spectrum of Floquet Hamiltonians</title>

Abstract: The spectral analysis of the unitary monodromy operator, associated with a time-periodically (paramatrically) forced Schrodinger equation, is a question of longstanding interest. Here, we consider this question for Hamiltonians of the form
  $$H^{\varepsilon}(t)=H^0 + \varepsilon^a W(\varepsilon^a t, -i\nabla)\, ,$$ where $H^0$ is an unperturbed autonomous Hamiltonian, $a\geq 1$, and $W(T,\cdot)$ has a period of $T_{\rm per} &gt;0$. In particular, in the small $\varepsilon&gt;0$ regime, we seek a comparison between the spectral properties of the monodromy operator, the one-period flow map associated with the $H^\varepsilon(t)$ dynamics, and that of the autonomous (unforced) flow, $\exp[-iH^0 T_{\rm per} \varepsilon ^{-a}]$. We consider $H^0$ which is spatially periodic on $\mathbb{R} ^n$ with respect to a lattice. Using the decomposition of $H^0$ and $H^\varepsilon(t)$ into their actions on spaces (Floquet-Bloch fibers) of pseudo-periodic functions, we establish a near spectral-invariance property for the monodromy operator, when acting data which are $\varepsilon$-localized in energy and quasi-momentum. Our analysis requires the following steps: (i) spectrally-localized data are approximated by {\it band-limited (Floquet-Bloch) wavepackets}; (ii) the envelope dynamics of such wavepackets is well approximated by an effective (homogenized) PDE, and (iii) an exact invariance property for band-limited Floquet-Bloch wavepackets, which follows from the effective dynamics. We apply our general results to a number of periodic Hamiltonians, $H^0$, of interest in the study of photonic and quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a nonlinear logistic model for age-structured population dynamics. The model incorporates interdependent fertility and mortality functions within a logistic framework, offering insights into stationary solutions and asymptotic behavior.

      <title>Existence and large radial solutions for an elliptic system under finite new Keller-Osserman integral conditions</title>

Abstract: We study the semilinear elliptic system
  \[ \Delta u = p(|x|)\,g(v), \qquad \Delta v = q(|x|)\,f(u), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}^n,\; n \geq 3, \]
  under new Keller--Osserman-type integral conditions on the nonlinearities $f,g$ and decay constraints on the radial weights $p,q$. Within this framework we prove: (i) existence of infinitely many entire positive radial solutions for admissible central values; (ii) closedness of the set of all admissible central values; and (iii) largeness (blow-up at infinity) of solutions at boundary points. The analysis combines comparison principles, compactness arguments, and Keller--Osserman transforms, thereby extending classical theory to coupled elliptic systems with general nonlinearities and weights.</description>

      <title>Diffusion operators on $p$-adic analytic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators are constructed on $p$-adic analytic manifolds using charts and transition maps from an atlas with connected nerve complex. In the compact case, an operator of Vladimirov-Taibleson type parametrised by a real parameter $s$ is defined. Its kernel function uses a geodetic-like distance function on the nerve complex of its atlas. The $L^2$-spectrum of this operator is established, and it is shown that it gives rise to a Feller semigroup. In this way, the Cauchy problem for the corresponding heat equation is solved in the positive by a transition function of a Markov process. The existence of a heat kernel function and a Green function in the case $s &gt; 1$ is proven. As an application, it is shown how to express the number of points on the reduction curve defined over the residue field of an elliptic curve with good reduction in terms of the eigenvalues of a Vladimirov-Taibleson-like operator. This provides for an alternative way of counting points on elliptic curves defined over finite fields.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian free-field as a stream function: continuum version of the scale-by-scale homogenization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note is about a drift-diffusion process $X$ with a time-independent, divergence-free drift $b$, where $b$ is a smooth Gaussian field that decorrelates over large scales. In two space dimensions, this just fails to fall into the standard theory of stochastic homogenization, and leads to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. In a previous paper by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang (2022), precise asymptotics of the annealed second moments of $X$ were derived by characterizing the asymptotics of the effective diffusivity $\lambda_L$ in terms of an artificially introduced large-scale cut-off $L$. The latter was carried out by a scale-by-scale homogenization, and implemented by monitoring the corrector $\phi_L$ for geometrically increasing cut-off scales $L^+=ML$. In fact, proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ for the corrector and flux corrector were introduced incrementally and the residuum $f_L$ estimated.
  In this short supplementary note, we reproduce the arguments of the above paper in the continuum setting of $M\downarrow 1$. This has the advantage that the definition of the proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ becomes more transparent -- it is given by a simple It\^{o} SDE with $\ln L$ acting as a time variable. It also has the advantage that the residuum $f_L$, which is a martingale, can be efficiently and precisely estimated by It\^{o} calculus. This relies on the characterization of the quadratic variation of the (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian driver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we connect two seemingly unrelated objects: On the one hand is a two-dimensional drift-diffusion process $X$ with divergence-free and time-independent drift $b$. The drift is given by a stationary Gaussian ensemble, and we focus on the critical case where a small-scale cut-off is necessary for well-posedness and the large-scale cancellations lead to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. On the other hand is the natural diffusion $F$ on the Lie group $\textbf{SL}(2)$ of matrices of determinant one. As a consequence of this connection, the strongly non-Gaussian character of $F$ transmits to how $X$ depends on its starting point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.</description>
