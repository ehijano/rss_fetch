      <title>The 3D index and Dehn filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>The growth rate on the volume of $\mathcal{M}_g^{&lt;L(g)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus g endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. In this paper, we introduce a function $L(g)$ of genus $g$ and call the geodesics whose length less than $L(g)$ short geodesics. We compute the growth rate on the volume of the subset of hyperbolic surfaces with short geodesics. In particular, when $g$ approaches infinity, if $L(g)$ also approaches infinity, then the volume of surfaces characterized by short geodesics is equal to $V_g$ almost surely.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Curves in Moduli Spaces Are Quasi-Isometrically Immersed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A holomorphic curve in moduli spaces is the image of a non-constant holomorphic map from a hyperbolic surface $B$ of type $(g,n)$ to the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_h$ of closed Riemann surfaces of genus $h$. We show that, when all peripheral monodromies are of infinite order, the holomorphic map is a quasi-isometric immersion with parameters depending only on $g$, $n$, $h$ and the systole of $B$. When peripheral monodromies also satisfy an additional condition, we find a lift quasi-isometrically embedding a fundamental polygon of the hyperbolic surface $B$ into the Teichm\"uller space. We further improve the Parshin-Arakelov finiteness theorem, by proving that there are only finitely many monodromy homomorphisms induced by holomorphic curves of type $(g,n)$ in $\mathcal{M}_h$ where systole is bounded away from $0$, up to equivalence.</description>

      <title>Persistent Khovanov homology of tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knot data analysis (KDA), which studies data with curve-type structures such as knots, links, and tangles, has emerging as a promising geometric topology approach in data science. While evolutionary Khovanov homology has been developed to analyze the global persistent topological features of links, it has limitations in capturing the local topological characteristics of knots and links. To address this challenge, we introduce the persistent Khovanov homology of tangles, providing a new mathematical framework for characterizing local features in curve-type data. While tangle homology is inherently abstract, we provide a concrete functor which maps the category of tangles to the category of modules, enabling the computation of tangle homology. Additionally, we employ planar algebra to construct a category of tangles without invoking fixed boundaries, thereby giving rise to a persistent Khovanov homology functor that enables practical applications. This framework provides a theoretical foundation and practical strategies for the topological analysis of curve-type data.</description>

      <title>Dax invariants, light bulbs, and isotopies of symplectic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves the following two main results. First, we classify the isotopy classes of embeddings of $\Sigma$ in $\Sigma\times S^2$ that are geometrically dual to $\{\mbox{pt}\}\times S^2$, where $\Sigma$ is a closed oriented surface with a positive genus, and show that there exist infinitely many such embeddings that are homotopic to each other but mutually non-isotopic. This answers a question of Gabai. Second, we show that the space of symplectic forms on an irrational ruled surface homologous to a fixed symplectic form has infinitely many connected components. This gives the first such example among closed $4$--manifolds and answers Problem 2(a) in McDuff--Salamon's problem list. The proofs are based on a generalization of the Dax invariant to embedded closed surfaces. In the proof, we also establish several properties of the smooth mapping class group of $\Sigma\times S^2$, which may be of independent interest. For example, we show that there exists a surjective homomorphism from $\operatorname{MCG}(\Sigma\times S^2)$ to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$, such that its restriction to the subgroup of elements pseudo-isotopic to the identity is also of infinite rank.</description>

      <title>The knot quandles of Suciu's ribbon $n$-knots and automorphisms on the free group of rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jab{\l}onowski proved that the knot quandles of Suciu's $n$-knots, which share isomorphic knot groups, are mutually non-isomorphic, and Yasuda later gave a different proof. In this paper, we present yet another proof of this result by analyzing the conjugacy classes of certain automorphisms of the free group of rank two.</description>
