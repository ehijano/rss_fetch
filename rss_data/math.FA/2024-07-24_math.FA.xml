      <title>Empirical wavelet frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their adaptive nature, empirical wavelets had several successes in many fields from engineering, science, medical signal/image processing. Recently, a general theoretical framework has been developed in the one-dimensional case, showing the possibility to build empirical wavelets from any classic mother wavelets. Given extensive literature both in theory and applications of classic wavelet frames, it is legitimate to ask about the feasibility of building empirical wavelet frames. We address this question in this paper. We prove several results which provide conditions on the existence of empirical wavelet frames taking into account the above mentioned adaptability.</description>

      <title>Fourier restriction for Schatten class operators and functions on phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a variant of Fourier restriction for operators in Schatten classes, where the Fourier-Wigner transform of a bounded operator replaces the Fourier transform of a function. The Fourier-Wigner transform is closely related to the group Fourier transform of the Heisenberg group. The first result shows that Fourier-Wigner restriction for Schatten class operators is equivalent to the restriction of the symplectic Fourier transform of functions on phase space. We deduce various Schatten class results for the quantum Fourier extension operator and answer a conjecture by Mishra and Vemuri concerning the Weyl transform of measures in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic grand Herz type spaces with variable exponents and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce some anisotropic grand Herz type spaces with variable exponents, including anisotropic grand Herz spaces, anisotropic grand Herz-Morrey spaces and anisotropic grand Herz-type Hardy spaces with variable exponents. We obtain some properties and characterizations of these spaces in terms of some decompositions. Using their decompositions, we obtain some boundedness on the anisotropic grand Herz type spaces with variable exponents for some singular integral operators.</description>

      <title>Wiener pairs of Banach algebras of operator-valued matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce several new examples of Wiener pairs $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{B}(\ell^2(X;\mathcal{H}))$ is the Banach algebra of bounded operators acting on the Hilbert space-valued Bochner sequence space $\ell^2(X;\mathcal{H})$ and $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A}(X)$ is a Banach algebra consisting of operator-valued matrices indexed by some relatively separated set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we introduce $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$-valued versions of the Jaffard algebra, of certain weighted Schur-type algebras, of Banach algebras which are defined by more general off-diagonal decay conditions than polynomial decay, of weighted versions of the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sj\"ostrand algebra, and of anisotropic variations of all of these matrix algebras, and show that they are inverse-closed in $\mathcal{B}(\ell^2(X;\mathcal{H}))$. In addition, we obtain that each of these Banach algebras is symmetric.</description>

      <title>Novel approach to root functions of matrix polynomials with applications in differential equations and meromorphic matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we address an invertible matrix polynomial $L(z)$ and its inverse $\hat{L}(z) := -L(z)^{-1}$. We present a method for obtaining a canonical set of root functions and Jordan chains of $L(z)$ through elementary transformations of the matrix $L(z)$ alone. This method provides a new and simple approach to deriving a general solution of the system of ordinary linear differential equations $L\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)u=0$ using only elementary transformations of the corresponding matrix polynomial $L(z)$.
  In the second part of the paper, given a matrix generalized Nevanlinna function $Q\in N_{\kappa }^{n \times n}$ and a canonical set of root functions of $\hat{Q}(z) := -Q(z)^{-1}$, we provide an algorithm to determine a specific Pontryagin space $(\mathcal{K}, [.,.])$, a specific self-adjoint operator $A:\mathcal{K}\rightarrow \mathcal{K}$ and an operator $\Gamma: \mathbb{C}^{n}\rightarrow \mathcal{K}$ that represent the function $Q$ in a Krein-Langer type representation. We demonstrate the main results through examples of linear systems of ODEs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, Firstly, we will write two new convex functions for $-1&lt;n-\alpha \leq 1\ $and two new lemmas. Then we will find the relevance of the two new lemmas to Caputo-left-sided derivatives under additional conditions and draw conclusions about them. Secondly,We will give examples that support it. In what follows, we will rewrite the Hermite Hadamard integral inequality based on this new definitions. Furthermore, we will write an elementary inequality valid for value $-1&lt;n-\alpha \leq 1.$</description>

      <title>Smoothness spaces for warped time-frequency representations -- Decomposition spaces and embedding relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we have shown that warped time-frequency representations provide a rich framework for the construction and study of smoothness spaces matched to very general phase space geometries obtained by diffeomorphic deformations of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Here, we study these spaces, obtained through the application of general coorbit theory, using the framework of decomposition spaces. This allows us to derive embedding relations between coorbit spaces associated to different warping functions, and relate them to established, important smothness spaces. In particular, we show that we obtain $\alpha$-modulation spaces and spaces of dominating mixed smoothness as special cases and, in contrast, that this is only possible for Besov spaces if $d=1$.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flow: Geodesic Convexity and Functional Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of probability density functions has been extensively studied in science and engineering to understand physical phenomena and facilitate algorithmic design. Of particular interest are dynamics that can be formulated as gradient flows of energy functionals under the Wasserstein metric. The development of functional inequalities, such as the log-Sobolev inequality, plays a pivotal role in analyzing the convergence of these dynamics. The goal of this paper is to parallel the success of techniques using functional inequalities, for dynamics that are gradient flows under the Fisher-Rao metric, with various $f$-divergences as energy functionals. Such dynamics take the form of a nonlocal differential equation, for which existing analysis critically relies on using the explicit solution formula in special cases. We provide a comprehensive study on functional inequalities and the relevant geodesic convexity for Fisher-Rao gradient flows under minimal assumptions. A notable feature of the obtained functional inequalities is that they do not depend on the log-concavity or log-Sobolev constants of the target distribution. Consequently, the convergence rate of the dynamics (assuming well-posed) is uniform across general target distributions, making them potentially desirable dynamics for posterior sampling applications in Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Jointly cyclic polynomials and maximal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a (not necessarily locally convex) topological vector space $\mathcal{X}$ of holomorphic functions in one complex variable, we show that the shift invariant subspace generated by a set of polynomials is $\mathcal{X}$ if and only if their common vanishing set contains no point at which the evaluation functional is continuous. For two variables, we show that this problem can be reduced to determining the cyclicity of a single polynomial and obtain partial results for more than two variables. We proceed to examine the maximal domain, i.e., the set of all points for which the evaluation functional is continuous. When $\mathcal{X}$ is metrizable, we show that the maximal domain must be an $F_\sigma$ set, and then construct Hilbert function spaces on the unit disk whose maximal domain is the disk plus an arbitrary subset of the boundary that is both $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic differentials and function theory on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite-area holomorphic quadratic differentials on an arbitrary Riemann surface $X=\mathbb{H}/\Gamma$ is uniquely determined by its horizontal measured foliation. By extending our prior result for $\Gamma$ of the first kind to arbitrary Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, we obtain that a measured foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is realized by the horizontal foliation of a finite-area holomorphic quadratic differential on $X$ if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ has finite Dirichlet integral. We determine the image of this correspondence when the infinite Riemann surface has bounded geometry -- an extension of the realization result of Hubbard and Masur for compact surfaces. A corollary is that a planar surface $X$ with bounded pants decomposition and with (at most) countably many ends is parabolic, i.e., does not support Green's function, in notation $X\in O_G$ where $G$ is Green's function. The class of harmonic functions with finite Dirichlet integral is denoted by $HD$. We give a geometric proof that the class $O_{HD}$ of the Riemann surfaces (that do not support non-constant $HD$-functions) is invariant under quasiconformal maps. Lyons proved that the $O_{HB}$ class (surfaces that do not support non-constant bounded harmonic functions) is not invariant under quasiconformal maps, and it is well-known that the $O_G$ class is invariant. Therefore, the noninvariant class $O_{HB}$ is between two invariant classes: $O_G\subset O_{HB}\subset O_{HD}$.</description>

      <title>Real analytic nonexpansive maps on polyhedral normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a real analytic nonexpansive map on a polyhedral normed space has a nonempty fixed point set, then we show that there is an isometry from an affine subspace onto the fixed point set. As a corollary, we prove that for any real analytic 1-norm or $\infty$-norm nonexpansive map on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a positive integer $q$ such that the period of any periodic orbit divides $q$ and $q$ is the order, or twice the order, of a permutation on $n$ letters. This confirms Nussbaum's $2^n$ Conjecture for $\infty$-norm nonexpansive maps in the special case where the maps are also real analytic.</description>
