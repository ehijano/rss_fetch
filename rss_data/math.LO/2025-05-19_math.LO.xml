      <title>A completeness theorem in proof-theoretic semantics via set-theoretic semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the completeness of intuitionistic logic with respect to Prawitz's proof-theoretic validity. As an intuitionistic natural deduction system, we apply atomic second-order intuitionistic propositional logic. By developing phase semantics with proof-terms introduced by Okada &amp; Takemura (2007), we construct a special phase model whose domain consists of closed terms. We then discuss how our phase semantics can be regarded as proof-theoretic semantics, and we prove completeness with respect to proof-theoretic semantics via our phase semantics.</description>

      <title>Nagata products of bimodules over residuated lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the (restricted) Nagata product construction, which produces a partially ordered semigroup from a bimodule consisting of a partially ordered semigroup acting on a (pointed) join semilattice. A canonical example of such a bimodule is given by a residuated lattice acting on itself by division, in which case the Nagata product coincides with the so-called twist product of the residuated lattice. We show that, given some further structure, a pointed bimodule can be reconstructed from its restricted Nagata product. This yields an adjunction between the category of cyclic pointed residuated bimodules and a certain category of posemigroups with additional structure, which subsumes various known adjunctions involving the twist product construction.</description>

      <title>Duality for finitely valued algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of natural dualities provides a well-developed framework for studying Stone-like dualities induced by an algebra $\mathbf{L}$ which acts as a dualizing object when equipped with suitable topological and relational structure. The development of this theory has, however, largely remained restricted to the case where $\mathbf{L}$ is finite. Motivated by the desire to provide a universal algebraic formulation of the existing duality of Cignoli and Marra or locally weakly finite MV-algebras and to extend it to a corresponding class of positive MV-algebras, in this paper we investigate Stone-like dualities where the algebra $\mathbf{L}$ is allowed to be infinite. This requires restricting our attention from the whole prevariety generated by $\mathbf{L}$ to the subclass of algebras representable as algebras of $\mathbf{L}$-valued functions of finite range, a distinction that does not arise in the case of finite $\mathbf{L}$. Provided some requirements on $\mathbf{L}$ are met, our main result establishes a categorical duality for this class of algebras, which covers the above cases of MV-algebras and positive MV-algebras.</description>

      <title>Internal Effectful Forcing in System T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectful forcing technique allows one to show that the denotation of a closed System T term of type $(\iota \to \iota) \to \iota$ in the set-theoretical model is a continuous function $(\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N}$. For this purpose, an alternative dialogue-tree semantics is defined and related to the set-theoretical semantics by a logical relation. In this paper, we apply effectful forcing to show that the dialogue tree of a System T term is itself System T-definable, using the Church encoding of trees.</description>

      <title>Separability Properties of Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal C$ is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored graphs from $\mathcal C$ using a fixed first-order interpretation. We prove that monadically dependent classes can be exactly characterized by the following property, which we call flip-separability: for every $r\in \mathbb{N}$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$ equipped with a weight function on vertices, one can apply a bounded (in terms of $\mathcal{C},r,\varepsilon$) number of flips (complementations of the adjacency relation on a subset of vertices) to $G$ so that in the resulting graph, every radius-$r$ ball contains at most an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the total weight. On the way to this result, we introduce a robust toolbox for working with various notions of local separations in monadically dependent classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06170v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known version of Rowbottom's theorem for supercompactness ultrafilters leads naturally to notions of two-cardinal Ramseyness and corresponding normal ideals introduced herein. Generalizing results of Baumgartner [7, 8], Feng [22] and the first author [16, 17], we study the hierarchies associated with a particular version of two-cardinal Ramseyness and a strong version of two-cardinal ineffability, as well as the relationships between these hierarchies and a natural notion of transfinite two-cardinal indescribability.</description>

      <title>Weak compactness cardinals for strong logics and subtlety properties of the class of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Boney, Dimopoulos, Gitman and Magidor, we characterize the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics through combinatorial properties of the class of ordinals. This analysis is then used to show that, in contrast to the existence of strong compactness cardinals, the existence of weak compactness cardinals for abstract logics does not imply the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal. More precisely, it is proven that the existence of a proper class of subtle cardinals is consistent with the axioms of ZFC if and only if it is not possible to derive the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals from the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics. Complementing this result, it is shown that the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics implies that unboundedly many ordinals are strongly inaccessible in the inner model HOD of all hereditarily ordinal definable sets.</description>

      <title>Local tabularity in MS4 with Casari's axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study local tabularity (local finiteness) in some extensions of $\mathsf{MS4}$ (monadic $\mathsf{S4}$). Our main result is a semantic characterization of local finiteness in varieties of $\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$-algebras, where $\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$ denotes the extension of $\mathsf{MS4}$ by the Casari axiom. We improve this to a syntactic criterion via the reducible path property identified in [Shap16], and note that the product logic $\mathsf{S4}[n] \times \mathsf{S5}$ is an extension of $\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$, obtaining a criterion for extensions of $\mathsf{S4}[n] \times \mathsf{S5}$ as an application. Next, we give a characterization of local finiteness in varieties of $\mathsf{MS4B}[2]$-algebras, where $\mathsf{MS4B}$ denotes the extension of $\mathsf{MS4}$ by the Barcan axiom. We demonstrate that our methods cannot be extended beyond depth 2, as we give a translation of the fusion $\mathsf{S5}_2$ into $\mathsf{MS4B}[3]$ for $n \geq 3$ that preserves and reflects local finiteness, suggesting that a characterization there remains difficult. Finally, we also establish the finite model property for some of these logics which are not known to be locally tabular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is consistent with ZF + DC that there exists an ultrafilter $U$ on $\omega$ such that two infinite ultraproducts of finite sets, $\prod A_n / U$ and $\prod B_n / U$, have the same cardinality if and only if $0 &lt; \lim_U |A_n|/|B_n| &lt; \infty$. In particular, this holds in $W[U]$, where $W$ is the Solovay Model and $U$ is $[\omega]^\omega$-generic.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of NF via Fuzzy Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a proof of the consistency of the set theory \emph{New Foundations} ($\mathit{NF}$). $\mathit{NF}$'s main idea is to permit very large sets (including the universal set) by restricting set formation to stratified formulas, thereby avoiding the classic set-theoretic paradoxes. Our proof employs a new forcing method incorporating concepts from fuzzy logic. A brief outline of the proof can be as follows: (1) we extend $ZF$ to \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{ZF}$ with a membership function $\mu$ over $D=\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$; (2) we define \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{NF}$ as $\Sigma$, and (3) we derive a crisp $\mathrm{N}$ model of \emph{Classic} $NF$. Our proof does not depend on Holmes' Tangled Type Theory ($\mathit{TTT}$). It establishes that if $\mathit{ZF}$ is consistent, then $\mathit{NF}$ is also consistent. It achieves that via the chain $\mathit{ZF} \rightarrow$ \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{ZF} \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mathit{NF}$. This method offers a novel perspective connecting fuzzy logic with classic set theory.</description>

      <title>Twins: non-isomorphic models forced to be isomorphic. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For which (first-order complete, usually countable) $T$ do there exist non-isomorphic models of $T$ which become isomorphic after forcing with a forcing notion $\mathbb{P}$? Necessarily, $\mathbb{P}$ is non-trivial; i.e.~it adds some new set of ordinals. It is best if we also demand that it collapses no cardinal. It is better to demand on the one hand that the models are non-isomorphic, and even \emph{far} from each other (in a suitable sense), but on the other hand, $\mathcal{L}$-equivalent in some suitable logic $\mathcal{L}$. We give sufficient conditions: for theories with the independence property, we proved this when $\mathbb{P}$ adds no new $\omega$-sequence. We may prove it ``for some $\mathbb{P}$," but better would be for some specific forcing notions. Best would be to characterize the pairs $(T,\mathbb{P})$ for which we have such models.
  The results say (e.g.) that there are models $M_1,M_2$ which are not isomorphic (and even \emph{far} from being isomorphic, in a rigorous sense) which become isomorphic when we extend the universe by adding a new branch to the tree $({}^{\theta&gt;}2,\lhd)$.
  We shall mention some specific choices of $\mathbb{P}$: mainly $({}^{\theta&gt;}2,\lhd)$ with $\theta = \theta^{&lt;\theta}$. That is, the reader just has to agree that starting with a universe $\mathbf{V}$ of set theory (i.e.~a model of $ZFC$) and a quasiorder $\mathbb{P}$, there are new directed $\mathbf{G} \subseteq \mathbb{P}$ meeting every dense subset of $D$ of $\mathbb{P}$, a universe $\mathbf{V}[\mathbf{G}]$ (so {it} satisfies $ZFC$) of which the original $\mathbf{V}$ is a transitive subclass. We may say that $\mathbf{V}[\mathbf{G}]$ (also denoted $\mathbf{V}^\mathbb{P}$) is the universe obtained by forcing with $\mathbb{P}$.
  This work does not require any serious knowledge of forcings, nor of stability theory.
  This is part of the classification and {Main Gap} program.</description>

      <title>Containment for Guarded Monotone Strict NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01254v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guarded Monotone Strict NP (GMSNP) extends Monotone Monadic Strict NP (MMSNP) by guarded existentially quantified predicates of arbitrary arities. We prove that the containment problem for GMSNP is decidable, thereby settling an open question of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, later restated by Bourhis and Lutz. Our proof also comes with a 2NEXPTIME upper bound on the complexity of the problem, which matches the lower bound for containment of MMSNP due to Bourhis and Lutz. In order to obtain these results, we significantly improve the state of knowledge of the model-theoretic properties of GMSNP. Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke previously showed that every GMSNP sentence defines a finite union of CSPs of $\omega$-categorical structures. We show that these structures can be used to obtain a reduction from the containment problem for GMSNP to the much simpler problem of testing the existence of a certain map called recolouring, albeit in a more general setting than GMSNP; a careful analysis of this yields said upper bound. As a secondary contribution, we refine the construction of Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke by adding a restricted form of homogeneity to the properties of these structures, making the logic amenable to future complexity classifications for query evaluation using techniques developed for infinite-domain CSPs.</description>
