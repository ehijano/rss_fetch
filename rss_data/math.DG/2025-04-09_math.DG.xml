      <title>Length of a closed geodesic in 3-manifolds of positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive scalar curvature, $R_g \geq 6$. We show that $M$ contains a non-trivial closed geodesic of length less than $22500$. This confirms a conjecture of M. Gromov in dimension $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of [30], we consider the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and collapsing in the family of compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary satisfying lower bounds on the sectional curvatures of interior manifolds, boundaries and the second fundamental forms of boundaries, and an upper diameter bound. We describe the local geometric structure of the limit spaces, and establish some stability results including Lipschitz homotopy stability.</description>

      <title>The evolution of a curve induced by the Pohlmeyer-Lund-Regge equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolution of space curves governed by the Pohlmeyer-Lund-Regge (PLR) equation, an integrable extension of the sine-Gordon equation. We examine a specific type of curve evolution, known as the Lund-Regge evolution, and derive its representation in the Frenet frame. We show the Frenet frame evolution aligns with the Lax system of the PLR equation and develop a construction method for curve families via the Sym formula. In conclusion, we describe the Lund-Regge evolution corresponding to Date's multi-soliton solutions to the PLR equation, with illustrations of curves and surfaces.</description>

      <title>P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequalities on submanifolds with small total mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish P\'olya-Szeg\H{o}-type inequalities (PSIs) for Sobolev-functions defined on a regular $n$-dimensional submanifold $\Sigma$ (possibly with boundary) of a $(n+m)$-dimensional Euclidean space, under explicit upper bounds of the total mean curvature. The $p$-Sobolev and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, as well as the spectral gap in $W^{1,p}_0(\Sigma)$ are derived as corollaries. Using these PSIs, we prove a sharp $p$-Log-Sobolev inequality for minimal submanifolds in codimension one and two. The asymptotic sharpness of both the multiplicative constant appearing in PSIs and the assumption on the total mean curvature bound as $n\to \infty$ is provided. A second equivalent version of our PSIs is presented in the appendix of this paper, introducing the notion of model space $(\mathbb{R}^+,\mathfrak{m}_{n,K})$ of dimension $n$ and total mean curvature bounded by $K$.</description>

      <title>Some structure theorems for Weingarten surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ be a properly embedded, connected, complete surface with boundary a convex planar curve $C$, satisfying an elliptic equation $H=f(H^2-K)$, where $H$ and $K$ are the mean and the Gauss curvature respectively - which we will refer to as Weingarten equation. When $M$ is contained in one of the two halfspaces determined by $C$, we give sufficient conditions for $M$ to inherit the symmetries of $C$. In particular, when $M$ is vertically cylindrically bounded, we get that $M$ is rotational if $C$ is a circle. In the case in which the Weingarten equation is linear, we give a sufficient condition for such a surface to be contained in a halfspace. Both results are generalizations of results of Rosenberg and Sa Earp, for constant mean curvature surfaces, to the Weingarten setting. In particular, our results also recover and generalize the constant mean curvature case.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Connections in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, in the setting of noncommutative differential geometry, a system of higher order connections is equivalent to a suitable generalization of the notion of phase space quantization (in the sense of Moyal star products on the symbol algebra). Moreover, we show that higher order connections are equivalent to (ordinary) connections on jet modules. This involves introducing the notion of natural linear differential operator, as well as an important family of examples of such operators, namely the Spencer operators, generalizing their corresponding classical analogues. Spencer operators form the building blocks of this theory by providing a method of converting between the different manifestations of higher order connections. A system of such higher order connections then gives a quantization, by which we mean a splitting of the quotient projection that defines symbols as classes of differential operators up to differential operators of lower order. This yields a notion of total symbol and of star product, the latter of which corresponds, when restricted to the classical setting, to phase space quantization in the context of quantum mechanics. In this interpretation, we allow the analogues of the position coordinates to form a possibly noncommutative algebra.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Ricci flows on infinite disk triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce combinatorial Ricci flows (CRFs in short) in Euclidean and hyperbolic background geometries on infinite triangulations of the open disk, which are discrete analogs of Ricci flows on simply connected open surfaces. We establish well-posedness results, the existence and the uniqueness, of CRFs in both Euclidean and hyperbolic background geometries. Moreover, we prove convergence results of CRFs, which indicate a uniformization theorem for CRFs on infinite disk triangulations. As an application, we prove an existence result of circle-packing metrics with infinite prescribed cone angles in hyperbolic background geometry. To our knowledge, these are the first results of CRFs on infinite triangulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an obstacle problem for the length-penalized elastic bending energy for open planar curves pinned at the boundary. We first consider the case without length penalization and investigate the role of global minimizers among graph curves in our minimization problem for planar curves. In addition, for large values of the length-penalization parameter $\lambda&gt;0$, we expose an explicit threshold parameter above which minimizers touch the obstacle, regardless of its shape. On contrary, for small values of $\lambda&gt;0$ we show that the minimizers do not touch the obstacle, and they are given by an explicit elastica.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06085v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3-dimensional contact group is a 3-dimensional Lie group endowed with a left-invariant contact structure. Making use of techniques from Riemannian geometry, we prove that any simply connected 3-dimensional contact group not isomorphic to SU(2) satisfies a unique factorization property. As an application, we develop a method to construct embeddings of 3-dimensional simply connected contact groups into one among two model tight contact manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We give a formula with explicit constants relating the subsurface projection $d_Y(\nu^-,\nu^+)$ of the end invariants $\nu^-,\nu^+$ of a hyperbolic 3-manifold $Q$ diffeomorphic to $S\times\mathbb{R}$ and the length of the geodesic representative in $Q$ of the multicurve $\partial Y$. This makes effective and computable the large projections versus short curves relation proved by Minsky. We give an application to closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds fibering over the circle providing a geometric analog of the uniform projection bound in fibered faces of Minsky and Taylor.</description>

Abstract: We show that the generalized Ricci tensor of a weighted complete Riemannian manifold can be retrieved asymptotically from a scaled metric derivative of Wasserstein 1-distances between normalized weighted local volume measures. As an application, we demonstrate that the limiting coarse curvature of random geometric graphs sampled from Poisson point process with non-uniform intensity converges to the generalized Ricci tensor.</description>

      <title>Local H-Principles for Partial Holomorphic Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of the realifications of an arbitrary \emph{partial holomorphic relation}. Our main result states that if any realification of an open partial holomorphic relation over a Stein manifold satisfies a relative to domain $h$--principle, then it is possible to deform any formal solution into one that is holonomic in a neighbourhood of a Lagrangian skeleton of the Stein manifold. If the Stein manifold is an open Riemann surface or it has finite type, then that skeleton is independent of the formal solution. This yields the existence of local $h$--principles over that skeleton. These results broaden those obtained by F. Forstneri\v{c} and M. Slapar on holomorphic immersions, submersions and complex contact structures for instance to holomorphic local $h$--principles for complex even contact, complex Engel or complex conformal symplectic structures.</description>

      <title>Random harmonic maps into spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a punctured Riemann surface with Euler characteristic $\chi(S)&lt;0$. For any unitary representation $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, we introduce its renormalized energy and its harmonic representatives, which are equivariant harmonic maps from the universal cover of $S$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Our main result is that if a sequence of unitary representations $\rho_j$ strongly converges, then their renormalized energies converge to $\frac{\pi}{4}|\chi(S)|$ and the shape of their harmonic representatives converges to a unique rescaled hyperbolic metric. Combining this statement with examples of strongly converging representations provided by random matrix theory, we derive the following applications.
  (1) If $\pi_1(S)$ is a free group, then for a random $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, the shape of its harmonic representatives concentrates around a rescaled hyperbolic metric with high probability as $N\to \infty$.
  (2) For any closed hyperbolic surface, a finite covering admits a harmonic immersion into some Euclidean unit sphere, which is almost isometric after rescaling.
  (3) There are closed, branched, minimal surfaces $\mathfrak{S}_j$ in some Euclidean unit spheres such that $\mathfrak{S}_j$ Benjamini-Schramm converges to a rescaled hyperbolic plane as $j\to \infty$, and the Gaussian curvature $K_j$ of $\mathfrak{S}_j$ satisfies $\lim_{j\to \infty} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Area}(\mathfrak{S}_j)}\int_{\mathfrak{S}_j} |K_j+8|=0.$</description>

      <title>Geometric structures on Weil bundles: Canonical differential-geometric constructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the transfer of classical geometric structures from a smooth manifold $M$ to its Weil bundle $(M^\mathbf A, \tilde\pi_M, M)$ associated with a Weil algebra $\mathbf A$. We show that various structures including locally conformal symplectic (lcs), locally conformal cosymplectic (lcc), contact, Jacobi, Sasakian, Walker, sub Riemannian, orientation, Riemannian, and K\"ahlerian structures admit canonical lifts to $M^\mathbf A$. Our approach emphasizes the differential geometric properties of these canonical constructions, utilizing the Weil projection $\tilde{\pi}_M$ and related functorial tools. This provides a unified perspective on endowing Weil bundles with rich geometric structure inherited from the base manifold. Furthermore, we highlight a specific construction yielding a cosymplectic manifold on $M^\mathbf{A}$ (for suitable $M$ and $\mathbf{A}$) that is demonstrably not a trivial suspension of a symplectic manifold. We also explicitly show how integrability of almost complex structures is preserved and clarify the nature of lifted characteristic vector fields.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Hessian estimator from random samples on a manifold with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common method for estimating the Hessian operator from random samples on a low-dimensional manifold involves locally fitting a quadratic polynomial. Although widely used, it is unclear if this estimator introduces bias, especially in complex manifolds with boundaries and nonuniform sampling. Rigorous theoretical guarantees of its asymptotic behavior have been lacking. We show that, under mild conditions, this estimator asymptotically converges to the Hessian operator, with nonuniform sampling and curvature effects proving negligible, even near boundaries. Our analysis framework simplifies the intensive computations required for direct analysis.</description>

      <title>A virtual $\mathrm{PGL}_r$-$\mathrm{SL}_r$ correspondence for projective surfaces</title>

Abstract: For a smooth projective surface $X$ satisfying $H_1(X,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $w \in H^2(X,\mu_r)$, we study deformation invariants of the pair $(X,w)$. Choosing a Brauer-Severi variety $Y$ (or, equivalently, Azumaya algebra $\mathcal{A}$) over $X$ with Stiefel-Whitney class $w$, the invariants are defined as virtual intersection numbers on suitable moduli spaces of stable twisted sheaves on $Y$ constructed by Yoshioka (or, equivalently, moduli spaces of $\mathcal{A}$-modules of Hoffmann-Stuhler).
  We show that the invariants do not depend on the choice of $Y$. Using a result of de Jong, we observe that they are deformation invariants of the pair $(X,w)$. For surfaces with $h^{2,0}(X) &gt; 0$, we show that the invariants can often be expressed as virtual intersection numbers on Gieseker-Maruyama-Simpson moduli spaces of stable sheaves on $X$. This can be seen as a $\mathrm{PGL}_r$-$\mathrm{SL}_r$ correspondence.
  As an application, we express $\mathrm{SU}(r) / \mu_r$ Vafa-Witten invariants of $X$ in terms of $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten invariants of $X$. We also show how formulae from Donaldson theory can be used to obtain upper bounds for the minimal second Chern class of Azumaya algebras on $X$ with given division algebra at the generic point.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoders for Warped Riemannian Metric Learning and Generative Modeling on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold using geodesic-guided flows. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real-world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.</description>

      <title>Soft cells, Kelvin's foam and the minimal surfaces of Schwarz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced a new class of shapes, called soft cells which fill space as soft tilings without gaps and overlaps while minimizing the number of sharp corners. We introduced the edge bending algorithm that deforms a polyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into standard soft tilings. Here, we demonstrate that certain triply periodic minimal surfaces naturally give rise to non-standard soft tilings. By extending the edge-bending algorithm, we further establish that the soft tilings derived from the Schwarz P and Schwarz D surfaces can be continuously transformed into one another through a one-parameter family of intermediate non-standard soft tilings. Notably, by carrying its combinatorial structure, both resulting tilings belong to the first order equivalence class of the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling on the body-centered cubic bcc lattice, highlighting a deep geometric connection underlying these minimal surface configurations. By requiring identical end-tangents for edges in a first order class, we also define second order equivalence classes among tilings and prove that there exist exactly two such classes among soft tilings which share the full symmetry group of the DV-bcc tiling. Additionally, we construct a one-parameter family of tilings bridging standard and non-standard soft tilings, explicitly including the classic Kelvin foam structure as an intermediate configuration. This construction highlights that both the soft cells themselves and the geometric methods employed in their generation provide valuable insights into the structural principles underlying natural forms. We also present the soft tiling induced by the gyroid structure.</description>
