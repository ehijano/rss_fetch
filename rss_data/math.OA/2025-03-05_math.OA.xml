      <title>Categorical relations and bipartite entanglement in tensor cones for Toeplitz and Fej\'er-Riesz operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper aims to understand separability and entanglement in tensor cones, in the sense of Namioka and Phelps, that arise from the base cones of operator system tensor products. Of particular interest here are the Toeplitz and Fej\'er-Riesz operator systems, which are, respectively, operator systems of Toeplitz matrices and Laurent polynomials of bounded degree (that is, trigonometric polynomials), and which are related in the operator system category through duality. Some additional categorical relationships established in this paper for Toeplitz and Fej\'er-Riesz operator systems. Of independent interest is a single matrix criterion, similar to the criterion involving the Choi matrix, for a linear map of the Fej\'er-Riesz operator system to be completely positive.</description>

      <title>The primitive spectrum of C*-algebras of etale groupoids with abelian isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Hausdorff locally compact \'etale groupoid $\mathcal G$, we describe as a topological space the part of the primitive spectrum of $C^*(\mathcal G)$ obtained by inducing one-dimensional representations of amenable isotropy groups of $\mathcal G$. When $\mathcal G$ is amenable, second countable, with abelian isotropy groups, our result gives the description of $\operatorname{Prim} C^*(\mathcal G)$ conjectured by van Wyk and Williams. This, in principle, completely determines the ideal structure of a large class of separable C$^*$-algebras, including the transformation group C$^*$-algebras defined by amenable actions of discrete groups with abelian stabilizers and the C$^*$-algebras of higher rank graphs. As an illustration we describe the primitive spectrum of the C$^*$-algebra of any row-finite higher rank graph without sources.</description>

      <title>The ideal separation property for reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that an inclusion of an algebra $A$ into a $C^*$-algebra $B$ has the ideal separation property if closed ideals in $B$ can be recovered by their intersection with $A$. Such inclusions have attractive properties from the point of view of harmonic analysis and noncommutative geometry. We establish several permanence properties of locally compact groups for which $L^1(G) \subseteq C^*_{\mathrm{red}}(G)$ has the ideal separation property.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of Bass-Serre Trees and the applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of $C^*$-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associated boundaries, through which we identify new families of $C^*$-simple groups including certain tubular groups, fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic and outer automorphism groups $\operatorname{Out}(BS(p, q))$ of Baumslag-Solitar groups. In addition, we study $n$-dimensional Generalized Baumslag-Solitar ($\text{GBS}_n$) groups. We first recover a result by Minasyan and Valiunas on the characterization of $C^*$-simplicity for $\text{GBS}_1$ groups and identify new $C^*$-simple $\text{GBS}_n$ groups including the Leary-Minasyan group. These $C^*$-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these $C^*$-simple fundamental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely infinite crossed product $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Real operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operator systems are the unital self-adjoint subspaces of the bounded operators on a Hilbert space. Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C$^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. We uncover several notable differences between the real and complex theory, including the absence of minimal and maximal functors in the category of real operator systems. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject. In the final two sections of our paper we study real analogues of the Kirchberg conjectures (and of several important related problems that have attracted much interest recently), and study the deep relationships between them.</description>
