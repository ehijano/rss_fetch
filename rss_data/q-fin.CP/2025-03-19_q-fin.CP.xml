      <title>Semi-Decision-Focused Learning with Deep Ensembles: A Practical Framework for Robust Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose Semi-Decision-Focused Learning, a practical adaptation of Decision-Focused Learning for portfolio optimization. Rather than directly optimizing complex financial metrics, I employ simple target portfolios (Max-Sortino or One-Hot) and train models with a convex, cross-entropy loss. I further incorporate Deep Ensemble methods to reduce variance and stabilize performance. Experiments on two universes (one upward-trending and another range-bound) show consistent outperformance over baseline portfolios, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of my approach.

      <title>Rolling Forward: Enhancing LightGCN with Causal Graph Convolution for Credit Bond Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have significantly advanced research in recommender systems over the past few years. These methods typically capture global interests using aggregated past interactions and rely on static embeddings of users and items over extended periods of time. While effective in some domains, these methods fall short in many real-world scenarios, especially in finance, where user interests and item popularity evolve rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel extension to Light Graph Convolutional Network (LightGCN) designed to learn temporal node embeddings that capture dynamic interests. Our approach employs causal convolution to maintain a forward-looking model architecture. By preserving the chronological order of user-item interactions and introducing a dynamic update mechanism for embeddings through a sliding window, the proposed model generates well-timed and contextually relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from BNP Paribas demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the performance of LightGCN while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of its architecture. Our findings provide new insights into designing graph-based recommender systems in time-sensitive applications, particularly for financial product recommendations.</description>

      <title>Axes that matter: PCA with a difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the scope of differential machine learning and introduce a new breed of supervised principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality of Derivatives problems. Applications include the specification and calibration of pricing models, the identification of regression features in least-square Monte-Carlo, and the pre-processing of simulated datasets for (differential) machine learning.</description>

      <title>Analyst Reports and Stock Performance: Evidence from the Chinese Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article applies natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify textual information to predict stock performance. Using an extensive dataset of Chinese analyst reports and employing a customized BERT deep learning model for Chinese text, this study categorizes the sentiment of the reports as positive, neutral, or negative. The findings underscore the predictive capacity of this sentiment indicator for stock volatility, excess returns, and trading volume. Specifically, analyst reports with strong positive sentiment will increase excess return and intraday volatility, and vice versa, reports with strong negative sentiment also increase volatility and trading volume, but decrease future excess return. The magnitude of this effect is greater for positive sentiment reports than for negative sentiment reports. This article contributes to the empirical literature on sentiment analysis and the response of the stock market to news in the Chinese stock market.</description>
