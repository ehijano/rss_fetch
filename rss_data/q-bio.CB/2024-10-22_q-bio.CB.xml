      <title>The Interplay Between Physical Activity, Protein Consumption, and Sleep Quality in Muscle Protein Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review examines the synergistic and individual influences of resistance exercise, dietary protein supplementation, and sleep/recovery on muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Electronic databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were extensively used. Studies were selected based on relevance to the criteria and were ensured to be directly applicable to the objectives. Research indicates that a protein dose of 20 to 25 grams maximally stimulates MPS post-resistance training. It is observed that physically frail individuals aged 76 to 92 and middle-aged adults aged 62 to 74 have lower mixed muscle protein synthetic rates than individuals aged 20 to 32. High-whey protein and leucine-enriched supplements enhance MPS more efficiently than standard dairy products in older adults engaged in resistance programs. Similarly, protein intake before sleep boosts overnight MPS rates, which helps prevent muscle loss associated with sleep debt, exercise-induced damage, and muscle-wasting conditions like sarcopenia and cachexia. Resistance exercise is a functional intervention to achieve muscular adaptation and improve function. Future research should focus on variables such as fluctuating fitness levels, age groups, genetics, and lifestyle factors to generate more accurate and beneficial results.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling and prediction of microglial cell dynamics in the ischemic penumbra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuroinflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke. During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the tissue surrounding the irreversibly injured infarct core, referred to as the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two distinct phenotypes; however, the dynamics between the detrimental M1 phenotype and beneficial M2 phenotype are not fully understood. Using phenotype-specific cell count data obtained from experimental studies on middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke in mice, we employ sparsity-promoting system identification techniques combined with Bayesian statistical methods for uncertainty quantification to generate continuous and discrete-time predictive models of the M1 and M2 microglial cell dynamics. The resulting data-driven models include constant and linear terms but do not include nonlinear interactions between the cells. Results emphasize an initial M2 dominance followed by a takeover of M1 cells, capture potential long-term dynamics of microglial cells, and suggest a persistent inflammatory response.</description>

      <title>Deep-Ace: LSTM-based Prokaryotic Lysine Acetylation Site Predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acetylation of lysine residues (K-Ace) is a post-translation modification occurring in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It plays a crucial role in disease pathology and cell biology hence it is important to identify these K-Ace sites. In the past, many machine learning-based models using hand-crafted features and encodings have been used to find and analyze the characteristics of K-Ace sites however these methods ignore long term relationships within sequences and therefore observe performance degradation. In the current work we propose Deep-Ace, a deep learning-based framework using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network which has the ability to understand and encode long-term relationships within a sequence. Such relations are vital for learning discriminative and effective sequence representations. In the work reported here, the use of LSTM to extract deep features as well as for prediction of K-Ace sites using fully connected layers for eight different species of prokaryotic models (including B. subtilis, C. glutamicum, E. coli, G. kaustophilus, S. eriocheiris, B. velezensis, S. typhimurium, and M. tuberculosis) has been explored. Our proposed method has outperformed existing state of the art models achieving accuracy as 0.80, 0.79, 0.71, 0.75, 0.80, 0.83, 0.756, and 0.82 respectively for eight bacterial species mentioned above. The method with minor modifications can be used for eukaryotic systems and can serve as a tool for the prognosis and diagnosis of various diseases in humans.</description>
