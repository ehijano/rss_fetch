      <title>Magnetic field morphology and evolution in the Central Molecular Zone and its effect on gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is known to be strongly magnetised, but its large-scale morphology and impact on the gas dynamics are not well understood. We explore the impact and properties of magnetic fields in the CMZ using three-dimensional non-self gravitating magnetohydrodynamical simulations of gas flow in an external Milky Way barred potential. We find that: (1) The magnetic field is conveniently decomposed into a regular time-averaged component and an irregular turbulent component. The regular component aligns well with the velocity vectors of the gas everywhere, including within the bar lanes. (2) The field geometry transitions from parallel to the Galactic plane near $z=0$ to poloidal away from the plane. (3) The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) causes an in-plane inflow of matter from the CMZ gas ring towards the central few parsecs of $0.01-0.1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ that is absent in the unmagnetised simulations. However, the magnetic fields have no significant effect on the larger-scale bar-driven inflow that brings the gas from the Galactic disc into the CMZ. (4) A combination of bar inflow and MRI-driven turbulence can sustain a turbulent vertical velocity dispersion of $\sigma_z \simeq 5$ km s$^{-1}$ on scales of $20$ pc in the CMZ ring. The MRI alone sustains a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_z \simeq 3$ km s$^{-1}$. Both these numbers are lower than the observed velocity dispersion of gas in the CMZ, suggesting that other processes such as stellar feedback are necessary to explain the observations. (5) Dynamo action driven by differential rotation and the MRI amplifies the magnetic fields in the CMZ ring until they saturate at a value that scales with the average local density as $B \simeq 102 (n/10^3 cm^{-3})^{0.33}$ $\mu$G. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results within the observational context in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Shiva and Shakti: Presumed Proto-Galactic Fragments in the Inner Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 astrometry and spectroscopy, we study two new substructures in the orbit-metallicity space of the inner Milky Way: $\textit{Shakti}$ and $\textit{Shiva}$. They were identified as two confined, high-contrast overdensities in the $(L_z, E)$ distribution of bright ($G&lt;16$) and metal-poor ($-2.5&lt;\rm{[M/H]}&lt;-1.0$) stars. Both have stellar masses of $M_\star \gtrsim 10^7M_\odot$, and are distributed on prograde orbits inside the Solar circle in the Galaxy. Both structures have an orbit-space distribution that points towards an $\textit{accreted}$ origin, however, their abundance patterns -- from APOGEE -- are such that are conventionally attributed to an $\textit{in situ}$ population. These seemingly contradictory diagnostics could be reconciled if we interpret the abundances [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Mg/Mn] $\textit{vs.}$ [Fe/H] distribution of their member stars merely as a sign of rapid enrichment. This would then suggest one of two scenarios. Either these prograde substructures were created by some form of resonant orbit trapping of the field stars by the rotating bar; a plausible scenario proposed by Dillamore et al. (2023). Or, $\textit{Shakti}$ and $\textit{Shiva}$ were proto-galactic fragments that formed stars rapidly and coalesced early, akin to the constituents of the $\textit{Poor Old Heart}$ of the Milky Way; just less deep in the Galactic potential and still discernible in orbit space.</description>

      <title>Chemical Diversity on Small Scales -- Abundance Analysis of the Tucana V Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of Milky Way satellites detected in recent years has introduced a new focus for stellar abundance analysis. Abundances of stars in satellites have been used to probe the nature of these systems and their chemical evolution. However, for most satellites, only centrally located stars have been examined. This paper presents an analysis of three stars in the Tucana V system, one in the inner region and two at $\sim$10\arcmin\ (7--10 half-light radii) from the center. We find a remarkable chemical diversity between the stars. One star exhibits enhancements in rapid neutron-capture elements (an $r$-I star), and another is highly enhanced in C, N, and O but with low neutron-capture abundances (a CEMP-no star). The metallicities of the stars analyzed span more than 1~dex from $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-3.55$ to $-2.46$. This, combined with a large abundance range of other elements like Ca, Sc, and Ni, confirms that Tuc~V is an ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy. The variation in abundances, highlighted by [Mg/Ca] ratios ranging from $+0.89$ to $-0.75$, among the stars, demonstrates that the chemical enrichment history of Tuc~V was very inhomogeneous. Tuc~V is only the second UFD galaxy in which stars located at large distances from the galactic center have been analyzed, along with Tucana~II. The chemical diversity seen in these two galaxies, driven by the composition of the non-central member stars, suggests that distant member stars are important to include when classifying faint satellites and that these systems may have experienced more complex chemical enrichment histories than previously anticipated.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origins of galactic bars: insights from barred and unbarred galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of local galaxies exhibit stellar bars, non-axisymmetric structures composed of stars, gas, and dust. Identifying key differences between the properties of barred and unbarred galaxies can uncover clues about the conditions for triggering bar formation. We explore the early stages of bar formation in a small sample of disc barred galaxies extracted from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and compare their properties to those of unbarred galaxies. According to our results, the most important difference between barred and unbarred galaxies is that the former have systematically higher fractions of stellar to dark matter mass in their inner regions, from very early stages and prior to the formation of the bars. They harbour high initial gas content, fostering increased star formation rates and leading to a central mass concentration that grows faster over time compared to unbarred galaxies. Examining the evolution of the halo spin within 10 ckpc reveals that barred galaxies have higher angular momentum transfer from the disc to the halo. Curiously, both barred and unbarred galaxies share similar initial low values of the halo spin, consistent with those proposed in the literature for bar formation. Furthermore, we evaluate existing stability criteria to capture the complexity of the process, and investigate the effects of mergers, flybys, and environment as possible drivers of bar formation. We find no clear link between mergers and disc instabilities resulting in the formation of bars, even though some of the simulated barred galaxies might have been influenced by these events.</description>

      <title>Shapes of dark matter haloes with discrete globular cluster dynamics: The example of NGC 5128 (Centaurus A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, dark matter haloes are expected to deviate from spherical symmetry. Constraining the halo shapes at large galactocentric distances is challenging due to the low density of luminous tracers. The well-studied early-type galaxy NGC 5128 (Centaurus A - CenA), has a large number of radial velocities for globular clusters (GCs) and planetary nebulae (PNe) of its extended stellar halo. In this work, we aim to determine the deviation from spherical symmetry of the dark matter halo of CenA at 5 $R_{\rm e}$ using its GCs as kinematic tracers. We used the largest photometric catalogue of GC candidates to accurately characterise the spatial distribution of the relaxed population and investigated the presence of non-relaxed structures in the kinematic catalogue of GCs using the relaxed point-symmetric velocity field as determined by the host's PNe population. We used anisotropic Jeans modelling under axisymmetric assumptions together with the Gaussian likelihood and GCs as discrete tracers. The gravitational potential is generated by flattened stellar and dark matter distributions. We leveraged different orbital properties of the blue and red GCs to model them separately. We find that discrete kinematics of the GCs are consistent with being drawn from an underlying relaxed velocity field determined from PNe. The best-fit parameters of the gravitational potential recovered from the blue and red GCs separately agree well and the joint results are: $M_{200} = 1.86^{1.61}_{-0.69}\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, $M_\star/L_{\rm B} = 2.98^{+0.96}_{-0.78}$ and the flattening $q_{\rm DM} = 1.45^{+0.78}_{-0.53}$. Both GC populations show mild rotation, with red having a slightly stronger rotational signature and radially biased orbits, and blue GCs preferring negative velocity anisotropy. An oblate or a spherical dark matter halo of CenA is strongly disfavoured by our modelling.</description>

      <title>Outward Migration in Nascent Stellar Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a stellar group forms within its parent molecular cloud, new members first appear in the deep interior. These overcrowded stars continually diffuse outward to the cloud boundary, and even beyond. Observations have so far documented only the interior drift. Those stars that actually leave the cloud form an expanding envelope that I call the "stellar mantle." Simple fluid models for the cloud and mantle illustrate their basic structure. The mantle's expansion speed is subsonic with respect to the cloud's dynamical temperature. I describe, in qualitative terms, how the expanding mantle and Galactic tidal radius might together shape the evolution of specific types of stellar groups. The massive stars in OB associations form in clouds that contract before extruding a substantial mantle. In contrast, the more slowly evolving clouds forming open clusters and T associations have extended mantles that encounter a shrinking tidal radius. These clouds are dispersed by internal stellar outflows. If the remaining group of stars is gravitationally bound, it appears as a long-lived open cluster, truncated by the tidal radius. If the group is unbound, it is a late-stage T association that will soon be torn apart by the tidal force. The "distributed" populations of pre-main~sequence stars observed in the outskirts of several star-forming regions are too distant to be stellar mantles. Rather, they could be the remnants of especially low-mass T associations.</description>

      <title>The Mass Density of MgII Absorbers from the Australian Dark Energy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-southern sky survey for MgII doublet absorbers in 951 z &lt; 4 AGN/quasar spectra from the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES). The spectral resolution ranges from R = 1400-1700 over the wavelengths 3700 A-8800 A. The survey has a 5sigma detection completeness of 50% and above for rest-frame equivalent widths W_r(2796) &gt;= 0.3 A. We studied 656 MgII absorption systems over the redshift range 0.33 &lt; z &lt; 2.19 with equivalent widths 0.3 &lt; W_r(2796) &lt; 3.45 A. The equivalent width distribution is well fit by an exponential function with W* = 0.76 +/- 0.04 A and the redshift path density exhibits very little evolution. Overall, our findings are consistent with the large, predominantly northern-sky, surveys of MgII absorbers. We developed and implemented a Monte Carlo model informed by a high-resolution MgII survey for determining the MgII mass density, Omega_MgII. We found Omega_MgII ~ 5 x 10^-7 with no evidence of evolution over a ~7 Gyr time span following Cosmic Noon. Incorporating measurements covering 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 from the literature, we extended our insights into MgII mass density evolution from the end of reionization well past the Cosmic Noon epoch. The presented Monte Carlo model has potential for advancing our knowledge of the evolution of mass densities of metal-ions common to quasar absorption line studies, as it exploits the efficiency of large low-resolution surveys while requiring only small samples from expensive high-resolution surveys.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Triplets Alignment in Large-scale Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the datasets of galaxy triplets and large-scale filaments obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we scrutinize the alignment of the three sides of the triangles formed by galaxy triplets and the normal vectors of the triplet planes within observed large-scale filaments. Our statistical investigation reveals that the longest and median sides of the galaxy triplets exhibit a robust alignment with the spines of their host large-scale filaments, while the shortest sides show no or only weak alignment with the filaments. Additionally, the normal vectors of triplets tend to be perpendicular to the filaments. The alignment signal diminishes rapidly with the increasing distance from the triplet to the filament spine, and is primarily significant for triplets located within distances shorter than $0.2$~Mpc$/h$, with a confidence level exceeding $20\sigma$. Moreover, in comparison to compact galaxy triplets, the alignment signal is more conspicuous among the loose triplets. This alignment analysis contributes to the formulation of a framework depicting the clustering and relaxation of galaxies within cosmological large-scale filament regimes, providing deeper insights into the intricate interactions between galaxies and their pivotal role in shaping galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>MOSEL survey: Spatially offset Lyman-continuum emission in a new emitter at z=3.088</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a unique Lyman-continuum (LyC) emitter at z=3.088. The LyC emission were detected using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/UVIS F336W filter, covering a rest-frame wavelength range of 760-900 Angstrom. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of LyC emission is 3.9 in a r=0.24'' aperture and is spatially offset by 0.29''+/-0.04'' (~ 2.2+/-0.3 kpc) from the rest-UV emission peak (F606W). By combining imaging and spectroscopic data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES, FRESCO and JEMS surveys, along with VLT/MUSE data from the MXDF survey, we estimate that the probability of random alignment with an interloper galaxy causing the LyC emission is less than 6x10^-5. The interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in the galaxy are similar to other LyC emitters at high redshift (12+log(O/H)=7.79+/-0.06, logU =-3.27+/-0.14, O32 = 3.65+/-0.22), although the single-peaked Lyman-alpha profile and lack of rest-UV emission lines suggest an optically thick ISM. We think that LyC photons are leaking through a narrow cone of optically thin neutral ISM, most likely created by a past merger (as evidenced by medium-band F210M and F182M images). Using the escape fraction constraints from individual leakers and a simple model, we estimate that the opening half-angle of ionization cones can be as low as 16^deg (2% ionised fraction) to reproduce some of the theoretical constraints on the average escape fraction for galaxies. The narrow opening angle required can explain the low number density of confirmed LyC leakers.</description>

      <title>Shock and Cosmic Ray Chemistry Associated with the Supernova Remnant W28</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) exert strong influence on the physics and chemistry of the nearby molecular clouds (MCs) through shock waves and the cosmic rays (CRs) they accelerate. To investigate the SNR-cloud interaction in the prototype interacting SNR W28 (G6.4$-$0.1), we present new observations of $\rm HCO^+$, HCN and HNC $J=1\text{--}0$ lines, supplemented by archival data of CO isotopes, $\rm N_2H^+$ and $\rm H^{13}CO^+$. We compare the spatial distribution and spectral line profiles of different molecular species. Using local thermodynatic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we obtain an abundance ratio $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim10^{-4}$ in the northeastern shocked cloud, which is higher by an order of magnitude than the values in unshocked clouds. This can be accounted for by the chemistry jointly induced by shock and CRs, with the physical parameters previously obtained from observations: preshock density $n_{\rm H}\sim 2\times 10^{5}\rm \ cm^{-3}$, CR ionization rate $\zeta=2.5\times 10^{-15} \rm \ s^{-1}$ and shock velocity $V_{\rm s}=15\text{--}20\rm \ km\ s^{-1}$. Towards a point outside the northeastern boundary of W28 with known high CR ionization rate, we estimate the abundance ratio $ N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm N_2H^+}) \approx 0.6\text{--}3.3$, which can be reproduced by a chemical simulation if a high density $n_{\rm H}\sim 2\times 10^5 \ \rm cm^{-3}$ is adopted.</description>

      <title>What have we learned about the life cycle of radio galaxies from new radio surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recurrent activity of radio AGN, with phases of activity alternating with periods of quiescence, has been known since the early studies of these objects. The full relevance of this cycle is emphasised by the requirement, from the AGN feedback scenario, of a recurrent impact of the energy released by the SMBH during the lifetime of the host galaxy: only in this way can AGN feedback influence galaxy evolution. Radio AGN in different evolutionary phases can be identified by their properties, like morphology and spectral indices. Dying/remnant and restarted sources have been the most elusive to select and characterise, but they are crucial to quantify the full life cycle. Thanks to the availability of new, large radio surveys (particularly at low frequencies), it is finally possible to make a more complete census of these rare sources and start building larger samples. This paper gives an overview of the recent work conducted using a variety of radio telescopes and surveys, highlighting some of the new results characterising the properties of dying/remnant and restarted radio sources and what has been learned about the life cycle of radio AGN. The comparison with the predictions from numerical simulations is also discussed. The results so far show that remnant and restarted radio AGN have a variety of properties which make these objects more complex than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Study of dependence of ram pressure stripping on the orbital parameters of the galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive observations of galaxy clusters suggest that gas deficiency in the galaxies could be due to ram pressure stripping due to the high-pressure intra-cluster medium acting on the galactic discs. The presence of gas in galaxies is essential for star formation. The net force due to ram pressure is dependent on the ambient medium and the orbit followed by the galaxy as it moves past the cluster medium. The current work deals with the effect of non-radial orbits of galaxies and the inclination of the disc plane of galaxies with the orbital plane on the mass of gas removed due to ram pressure. This gives a realistic approach to understanding the process of ram pressure stripping. The orbital parameters are extracted from EAGLE simulation data set along with the mass distribution of the galaxies. The analytical model proposed by Singh et. al. (2019) is modified appropriately to include the effect of the inclination angle. The non-radial orbits and infalling galaxies not being face-on decrease the amount of gas removed. Moreover, the inclination angle has a pronounced effect on the stripping of gas in low-mass galaxies as compared to high-mass galaxies with similar inclinations. The results show that the efficiency of the ram pressure stripping can be much lower in some cases, and hence gas in infalling galaxies can survive for much longer than expected from a simple analysis.</description>

      <title>Gas inflows from cloud to core scales in G332.83-0.55: Hierarchical hub-filament structures and tide-regulated gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive star-forming region G332.83-0.55 contains at least two levels of hub-filament structures. The hub-filament structures may form through the "gravitational focusing" process. High-resolution LAsMA and ALMA observations can directly trace the gas inflows from cloud to core scales. We investigated the effects of shear and tides from the protocluster on the surrounding local dense gas structures. Our results seem to deny the importance of shear and tides from the protocluster. However, for a gas structure, it bears the tidal interactions from all external material, not only the protocluster. To fully consider the tidal interactions, we derived the tide field according to the surface density distribution. Then, we used the average strength of the external tidal field of a structure to measure the total tidal interactions that are exerted on it. For comparison, we also adopted an original pixel-by-pixel computation to estimate the average tidal strength for each structure. Both methods give comparable results. After considering the total tidal interactions, the slope of the $\sigma-N*R$ relation changes from 0.20 to 0.52, close to 0.5 of the pure free-fall gravitational collapse, and the correlation also becomes stronger. Thus, the deformation due to the external tides can effectively slow down the pure free-fall gravitational collapse of gas structures. The external tide tries to tear up the structure, but the external pressure on the structure prevents this process. The counterbalance between the external tide and external pressure hinders the free-fall gravitational collapse of the structure, which can also cause the pure free-fall gravitational collapse to be slowed down. These mechanisms can be called "tide-regulated gravitational collapse."</description>

      <title>The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Dust emission effective radius up to 3 kpc in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the size of dust continuum emission are an important tool for constraining the spatial extent of star formation and hence the build-up of stellar mass. Compact dust emission has generally been observed at Cosmic Noon (z~2-3). However, at earlier epochs, toward the end of the Reionization (z~4-6), only the sizes of a handful of IR-bright galaxies have been measured. In this work, we derive the dust emission sizes of main-sequence galaxies at z~5 from the ALPINE survey. We measure the dust effective radius r_e,FIR in the uv-plane in Band 7 of ALMA for seven ALPINE galaxies with resolved emission and we compare it with rest-frame UV and [CII]158$\mu$m measurements. We study the r_e,FIR-L_IR scaling relation by considering our dust size measurements and all the data in literature at z~4-6. Finally, we compare our size measurements with predictions from simulations. The dust emission in the selected ALPINE galaxies is rather extended (r_e,FIR~1.5-3 kpc), similar to [CII]158 um but a factor of ~2 larger than the rest-frame UV emission. Putting together all the measurements at z~5, spanning 2 decades in luminosity from L_IR ~ 10^11 L_sun to L_IR ~ 10^13 L_sun, the data highlight a steeply increasing trend of the r_e,FIR-L_IR relation at L_IR&lt; 10^12 L_sun, followed by a downturn and a decreasing trend at brighter luminosities. Finally, simulations that extend up to the stellar masses of the ALPINE galaxies considered in the present work predict a sub-set of galaxies (~25% at 10^10 M_sun &lt; M_star &lt; 10^11 M_sun) with sizes as large as those measured.</description>

      <title>The Galactic latitude dependency of Faraday complexity in the S-PASS/ATCA RM catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S-band Polarisation All Sky Survey (SPASS/ATCA) rotation measure (RM) catalogue is the largest broadband RM catalogue to date, increasing the RM density in the sparse southern sky. Through analysis of this catalogue, we report a latitude dependency of the Faraday complexity of polarised sources in this catalogue within 10$^\circ$ of the Galactic plane towards the inner Galaxy. In this study, we aim to investigate this trend with follow-up observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We observe 95 polarised sources from the SPASS/ATCA RM catalogue at 1.1 - 3.1 GHz with ATCA's 6 km configuration. We present Stokes QU fitting results and a comparative analysis with the SPASS/ATCA catalogue. We find an overall decrease in complexity in these sources with the higher angular resolution observations, with a complexity fraction of 42\%, establishing that the majority of the complexity in the SPASS/ATCA sample is due to the mixing-in of diffuse Galactic emission at scales $\theta &gt; 2.8'$. Furthermore, we find a correlation between our observed small-scale complexity $\theta &lt; 2.8'$ and the Galactic spiral arms, which we interpret to be due to Galactic turbulence or small-scale polarised emission. These results emphasise the importance of considering the maximum angular scale to which the observations are sensitive in the classification of Faraday complexity; the effect of which can be more carefully investigated with SKA-precursor and pathfinder arrays (e.g. MeerKAT and ASKAP).</description>

Abstract: The formation of stars, particularly the high-mass star formation, poses several still open questions. Nowadays, thanks to the most modern telescopes and instruments, we are able to observe and analyse many physical and chemical processes involved in the birth of massive stars. This work introduces to the interstellar medium, cradle of the stars, and makes focus on the interstellar structures distributed in the different spatial scales related to the collapse of the gas that gives rise to the star formation processes. Through some current works done by the investigation group of Interstellar Medium, Star Formation and Astrochemistry belonging to Instituto de Astronom\'ia y F\'isica del Espacio (https://interestelariafe.wixsite.com/mediointerestelar), it is shown that the observational study of the star formation is a research that must be carried out in a multispectral way, pointing to the spatial multiscale.</description>

      <title>The properties and kinematics of HCN emission across the closest starburst galaxy NGC 253 observed with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying molecular gas in nearby galaxies using hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as a tracer for higher densities than CO emission still poses a significant challenge. Even though several galaxies have HCN maps on a few kpc scales, higher-resolution maps are still required. Our goal is to examine the contrast in intensity between two tracers that probe different density regimes - HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1) ratio - and their kinematics across NGC 253. By utilizing the advanced capabilities of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we can map these features at high resolution across a large field of view and uncover the nature of such dense gas in extragalactic systems. We present new ALMA Atacama Compact Array and Total Power (ACA+TP) observations of the HCN emission across NGC 253, covering the inner 8.6' of the galaxy disk at 300 pc scales. We analyze the integrated intensity and mean velocity of HCN and CO along each line of sight and use SCOUSE software to perform spectral decomposition, which considers each velocity component separately. Molecular gas traced by HCN piles up in a ring-like structure at a radius of 2 kpc. The HCN emission is enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude in the central 2 kpc regions, beyond which its intensity decreases with increasing galactocentric distance. The number of components in the HCN spectra shows a robust environmental dependence, with multiple velocity features across the center and bar. We have identified an increase in the HCN/CO ratio in these regions, corresponding to a velocity component likely associated with a molecular outflow. We have also discovered that the ratio between the total infrared luminosity and dense gas mass, which indicates the star formation efficiency of dense gas, is anti-correlated with the molecular gas surface density up to approximately 200 Msul/pc^2. In contrast, beyond this point, the ratio starts to increase.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the galaxy rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 21 galaxies, with variations spanning three orders of magnitude in galactic mass, is also reproduced.</description>

      <title>Tracing back the birth environments of Type Ia supernova progenitor stars: A pilot study based on 44 early-type host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environmental dependence of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities is well-established, and efforts are being made to find its origin. Previous studies typically use the currently-observed status of the host galaxy. However, given the delay time between the birth of the progenitor star and the SN Ia explosion, the currently-observed status may differ from the birth environments of the SN Ia progenitor star. In this paper, employing the chemical evolution and accurately determined stellar population properties of 44 early-type host galaxies, we, for the first time, estimate the SN Ia progenitor star birth environment, specifically $[Fe/H]_{Birth}$ and $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$. We show that $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ has a $30.4^{+10.6}_{-10.1}\%$ wider range than $[\alpha/Fe]_{Current}$, while the range of $[Fe/H]_{Birth}$ is not statistically different ($17.9^{+26.0}_{-27.1}\%$) to that of $[Fe/H]_{Current}$. The birth and current environments of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] are sample from different populations (p-values of the KS test &lt; 0.01). We find that light-curve fit parameters are insensitive to $[Fe/H]_{Birth}$ ($&lt;0.9\sigma$ for the non-zero slope), while a linear trend is observed with HRs at the 2.4$\sigma$ significance level. With $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$, no linear trends ($&lt;1.1\sigma$) are observed. Interestingly, we find that $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ clearly splits the SN Ia sample into two groups: SN Ia exploded in $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$-rich or $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$-poor environments. SNe Ia exploded in different $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ groups have different weighted-means of light-curve shape parameters: $0.81\pm0.33$ ($2.5\sigma$). They are thought to be drawn from different populations (p-value = 0.01). Regarding SN Ia colour and HRs, there is no difference in the weighted-means ($&lt;1.0\sigma$) and distributions (p-value &gt; 0.27) of each $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ group.</description>

      <title>A mathematical foundation for QUMOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We link the QUMOND theory with the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition and introduce a new formula for the gradient of the Mondian potential using singular integral operators. This approach allows us to demonstrate that, under very general assumptions on the mass distribution, the Mondian potential is well-defined, once weakly differentiable, with its gradient given through the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition. Furthermore, we establish that the gradient of the Mondian potential is an $L^p$ vector field. These findings lay the foundation for a rigorous mathematical analysis of various issues within the realm of QUMOND. Given that the Mondian potential satisfies a second-order partial differential equation, the question arises whether it has second-order derivatives. We affirmatively answer this question in the situation of spherical symmetry, although our investigation reveals that the regularity of the second derivatives is weaker than anticipated. We doubt that a similarly general regularity result can be proven without symmetry assumptions. In conclusion, we explore the implications of our results for numerous problems within the domain of QUMOND, thereby underlining their potential significance and applicability.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic origin of two dormant BH binaries: Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two systems that have been confirmed as dormant (no X-ray emission detected) black hole (BH) - low-mass star binaries (Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2) in the latest Gaia mission data release (DR3) are very intriguing in the context of their evolution. Both systems consist of $\sim 9 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ BH and $\sim 1 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ star orbiting each other on a wide, eccentric orbit ($e\sim 0.5$). We argue that the formation of Gaia BH-like systems through the isolated binary evolution (IBE) channel under standard common envelope assumptions and from dynamical interactions in young massive and open clusters is equally probable, and the formation rate of those binaries is on order of $10^{-7} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}^{-1}$ in both channels. What plays an important role in formation of Gaia BH-like systems in the case of IBE channel is the mutual position of the natal kick velocity vector and the binary angular momentum vector. We find that the natal kicks of median magnitude $\sim 40$ km/s are preferred for the formation of Gaia BH1-like binaries. $\sim 94\%$ of those binaries is formed with BH spin misaligned to orbital axis by less than $40^{\circ}$. Gaia BH2-like binaries form if the low velocity natal kick (of median magnitude $\sim 20$ km/s) is directed within $15^{\circ}$ about the orbital plane. We follow the subsequent evolution of the binaries once formed as Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2 systems to investigate their connection with the low-mass X-ray binary population.</description>

      <title>The Brown Dwarf Kinematics Project (BDKP). VI. Ultracool Dwarf Radial and Rotational Velocities from SDSS/APOGEE High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present precise measurements of radial (RV) and projected rotational ($v\sin{i}$) velocities, effective temperatures, and surface gravities of a sample of 258 M6 to L2 dwarfs with multi-epoch, high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 22500), near-infrared (1.514-1.696 $\mu$m) spectroscopic observations reported in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17. The spectra were modeled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling method which achieved median precisions of $\sigma_\text{RV}$ = 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{v\sin{i}}$ = 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. One-half of our sample (138 sources) are previously known members of nearby young clusters and moving groups, and we identified three new kinematic members of the Argus or Carina Near moving groups, 2MASS J05402570+2448090, 2MASS J14093200+4138080, and 2MASS J21272531+5553150. Excluding these sources, we find that the majority of our sample has kinematics consistent with the Galactic thin disk, and eleven sources are associated with the intermediate thin/thick disk. The field sample has a velocity dispersion of 38.2$\pm$0.3 km s$^{-1}$, equivalent to an age of 3.30$\pm$0.19 Gyr based on empirical age-velocity dispersion relations; and a median $v\sin{i}$ of 17 km s$^{-1}$. For 172 sources with multi-epoch observations, we identified 37 as having significant radial velocity variations, and determined preliminary orbit parameters for 26 sources with four or more epochs. For 40 sources with photometric variability periods from the literature less than 5 days and $v\sin{i}$ $&gt;$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, we find a decline in projected radii $R\sin{i}$ with age congruent with evolutionary models. Finally, we also present multi-epoch RV and vsini measurements for additional 444 candidate ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: The core of an extremely massive proto-cluster at the Epoch of Reionization probed with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: The SPT0311-58 system resides in a massive dark matter halo at z ~ 6.9. It hosts two dusty galaxies (E and W) with a combined star formation rate of ~3500 Msun/yr. Its surrounding field exhibits an overdensity of sub-mm sources, making it a candidate proto-cluster.
  We use spatially-resolved spectroscopy provided by the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to probe a field of view (FoV) ~ 17 x 17 kpc^2 around this object.
  These observations have revealed ten new galaxies at z ~ 6.9, characterised by dynamical masses spanning from ~10^9 to 10^10 Msun and a range in radial velocities of ~ 1500 km/s, in addition to the already known E and W galaxies. The implied large number density, and the wide spread in velocities, indicate that SPT0311-58 is at the core of a proto-cluster, immersed in a very massive dark matter halo of ~ 6 x 10^12 Msun. Hence, it represents the most massive proto-cluster ever found at the EoR. We also study the dynamical stage of the system and find that it likely is not fully virialised.
  The galaxies exhibit a great diversity of properties showing a range of evolutionary stages. We derive their ongoing Ha-based unobscured SFR, and find that its contribution to the total SF varies significantly across the galaxies in the system. Their ionization conditions range from those typical of field galaxies at similar redshift recently studied with JWST to those found in more evolved objects at lower z. The metallicity spans more than 0.8 dex across the FoV, reaching nearly solar values in some cases. The detailed IFU spectroscopy of the E galaxy reveals that it is actively assembling its stellar mass, showing sub-kpc inhomogeneities, and a metallicity gradient that can be explained by accretion of low metallicity gas from the IGM. The kinematic maps indicate departures from regular rotation, high turbulence, and a possible pre-collision minor merger. (Abridged)</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel halo/galaxy matching technique between two cosmological simulations with different resolutions, which utilizes the positions and masses of halos along their subhalo merger tree. With this tool, we conduct a study of resolution biases through the {\it galaxy-by-galaxy} inspection of a pair of simulations that have the same simulation configuration but different mass resolutions, utilizing a suite of {\sc IllustrisTNG} simulations to assess the impact on galaxy properties. We find that, with the subgrid physics model calibrated for TNG100-1, subhalos in TNG100-1 (high resolution) have $\lesssim0.5$ dex higher stellar masses than their counterparts in the TNG100-2 (low-resolution). It is also discovered that the subhalos with $M_{\mathrm{gas}}\sim10^{8.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ in TNG100-1 have $\sim0.5$ dex higher gas mass than those in TNG100-2. The mass profiles of the subhalos reveal that the dark matter masses of subhalos in TNG100-2 converge well with those from TNG100-1, except within 4 kpc of the resolution limit. The differences in stellar mass and hot gas mass are most pronounced in the central region. We exploit machine learning to build a correction mapping for the physical quantities of subhalos from low- to high-resolution simulations (TNG300-1 and TNG100-1), which enables us to find an efficient way to compile a high-resolution galaxy catalog even from a low-resolution simulation. Our tools can easily be applied to other large cosmological simulations, testing and mitigating the resolution biases of their numerical codes and subgrid physics models.</description>

      <title>An analytic description of substructure-induced gravitational perturbations in stellar systems</title>

Abstract: Perturbations to stellar systems can reflect the gravitational influence of dark matter substructures. On scales much smaller than the size of a stellar system, we point out analytic connections between the stellar and dark matter distributions. In particular, the density and velocity power spectra of the stars are proportional to the density power spectrum of the perturbing dark matter, scaled by $k^{-4}$. This relationship allows easy evaluation of the suitability of a stellar system for detecting dark substructure. As examples, we show that the Galactic stellar halo is expected to be sensitive to cold dark matter substructure at wavenumbers $k\lesssim 0.3$ kpc$^{-1}$, and the Galactic disk might be sensitive to substructure at wavenumbers $k\sim 4$ kpc$^{-1}$. The perturbations considered in this work are short-lived, being rapidly erased by the stellar velocity dispersion, so it may be possible to attribute a detection to dark matter substructure without ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Enrichment by Extragalactic First Stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the Milky Way's most massive satellite galaxy, which only recently (~2 billion years ago) fell into our Galaxy. Since stellar atmospheres preserve their natal cloud's composition, the LMC's recent infall makes its most ancient, metal-deficient ("low-metallicity") stars unique windows into early star formation and nucleosynthesis in a formerly distant region of the high-redshift universe. Previously, identifying such stars in the LMC was challenging. But new techniques have opened this window, now enabling tests of whether the earliest element enrichment and star formation in distant, extragalactic proto-galaxies deviated from what occurred in the proto-Milky Way. Here we present the elemental abundances of 10 stars in the LMC with iron-to-hydrogen ratios ranging from ~1/300th to ~1/12,000th of the Sun. Our most metal-deficient star is 50 times more metal-deficient than any in the LMC with available detailed chemical abundance patterns, and is likely enriched by a single extragalactic first star supernova. This star lacks significant carbon-enhancement, as does our overall sample, in contrast with the lowest metallicity Milky Way stars. This, and other abundance differences, affirm that the extragalactic early LMC experienced diverging enrichment processes compared to the early Milky Way. Early element production, driven by the earliest stars, thus appears to proceed in an environment-dependent manner.</description>

      <title>On the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar as revealed by the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way is widely considered to exhibit features of a rotational bar or quadrupole bar. In either case, the feature of the resonance of the Galactic bar should be present in the properties of the chemistry and kinematics, over a large area of the disk. With a sample of over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars from LAMOST-APOGEE data, we attempt to detect the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar, within 4.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The measurement of the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ $-$ $R$ with subtracted the global profiles trends, shows that the thin and thick disks values Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.010 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.598 $R$ + 2.551) and Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.006 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.258 $R$ $-$ 0.019), respectively. The analysis of the tilt angle of the velocity ellipsoid indicates that the thin and thick disks are accurately described as $\alpha$ = $\alpha_{0}$ arctan (Z/R), with $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.198 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.853 $R$ + 1.982) + 0.630 and $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.220 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.884 $R$ + 2.012) + 0.679 for thin and thick disks, respectively. These periodic oscillations in Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ and $\alpha_{0}$ with $R$ appear in both thin and thick disks, are the most likely chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonance of the Galactic bar. The difference in the phase of the functions of the fitted periodic oscillations for the thin and thick disks may be related to the presence of a second Galactic bar.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Thermal Torques on AGN Disc Migration Traps and Gravitational Wave Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion discs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) foster black hole (BH) formation, growth, and mergers. Stellar mass BHs migrate inwards under the influence of hydrodynamical torques unless they encounter a region where the torque flips sign. At these migration traps, BHs accumulate and merge via dynamical or gas-assisted interactions, producing high-frequency LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) sources and potentially cutting off the supply of extreme mass ratio inspirals that would otherwise make low-frequency, {\it LISA}-band GWs. In this paper, we study the interplay between different types of migration torques, focusing especially on the ``thermal torques'' generated by the thermal response of the AGN to embedded stellar-mass BHs that accrete through their own mini-discs.In contrast to previous work, we find that Type I torques cannot produce migration traps on their own, but thermal torques often do, particularly in low-mass AGN. The migration traps produced by thermal torques exist at much larger radii ($\sim 10^{3-5}$ gravitational radii) than do previously identified Type I traps, carrying implications for GW populations at multiple frequencies. Finally, we identify a bifurcation of AGN discs into two regimes: migration traps exist below a critical AGN luminosity, and do not at higher luminosities. This critical luminosity is fit as $\log_{10} L_{\rm AGN}^c = 45 - 0.32 \log_{10}{(\alpha/0.01)}$ where $\alpha$ is the AGN alpha viscosity parameter, a range compatible with recent claims that LVK GWs are not preferentially associated with high-luminosity AGN.</description>

      <title>Study of Magnetic Field and Turbulence in the TeV halo around Monogem Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, including extended objects such as supernova remnants and diffuse halos around Pulsars. Its turbulent characteristics govern the diffusion of cosmic rays and the multi-wavelength emission from PWNe. However, the geometry and turbulence nature of the magnetic fields in the ambient region of PWN is still unknown. Recent gamma-ray observations from HAWC and synchrotron observations suggest a highly suppressed diffusion coefficient compared to the mean interstellar value. In this study, we present the first direct observational evidence of the orientation of the mean magnetic field and turbulent characteristics by employing a recently developed statistical parameter `Y$_{turb}$' in the extended halo around the Monogem pulsar. Our study points two possible scenarios: nearly aligned toward the line of sight (LoS) with compressible modes dominance or high inclination angle toward LoS and characterized by Alfv\'enic turbulence. The first scenario appears consistent with other observational signatures. Furthermore, we report that the magnetic field has an observed correlation length of approximately $3 \pm 0.6 {\rm pc}$ in the Monogem halo. Our study highlights the pivotal role of magnetic field and turbulence in unraveling the physical processes in TeV halos and cosmic ray transport.</description>
