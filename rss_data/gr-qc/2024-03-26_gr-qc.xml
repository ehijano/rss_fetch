      <title>The cosmic trimmer: Black-hole hair in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is altered by cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static black holes in general relativity modified by a linear scalar coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant always carry hair. We show that the same mechanism that creates the hair makes it incompatible with a cosmological horizon. Other scalar-tensor models do not have this problem when time-dependence of the scalar provides a natural matching to cosmology. Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet is particularly rigid and such a scenario does not help. An extra operator makes the theory behave like the other models and the cosmological horizon can be accommodated. The hair, however, is drastically altered.</description>

      <title>Bouncing behavior in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity: Phantom crossing and energy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the bouncing behavior of the universe within the framework of $f(R,L_m)$ gravity, using a simple form of $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^\gamma$ (where $\gamma$ is a free model parameter) as previously studied. The model predicts a vanishing Hubble parameter in the early and late times, with the deceleration parameter approaching a specific limit at the bouncing point. The EoS parameter is observed to cross the phantom divide line ($\omega=-1$) near the bouncing point, indicating a significant transition from a contracting to an expanding phase. The model satisfies the necessary energy conditions for a successful bouncing scenario, with violations indicating exotic matter near the bouncing point. Stability conditions are satisfied for certain values of $\gamma$ near the bouncing point, but potential instabilities in late-time evolution require further investigation. Finally, we conclude that the $f(R,L_m)$ gravity model is promising for understanding the universe's dynamics, especially during events like the bouncing phase.</description>

      <title>Spin-2 fields and cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the possibility of the formation of naked singularities in the interaction of Kerr black holes with test massless spin-2 fields. We analyse the scattering problem for both extremal and nearly extremal black holes by incorporating the explicit form of the absorption probabilities. We show that extremal black holes become non-extremal after the interaction with the modes with both positive and negative absorption probabilities. For nearly extremal black holes the absorption probability for the challenging modes turns out to be of the order $\epsilon^5$, where $\epsilon$ parametrizes the closeness to extremality. This value implies that the event horizon is preserved without the need to employ the backreaction effects. The result directly follows from the incorporation of the absorption probabilities into the analysis. We also review and extend our previous comments on Sorce-Wald method. We show that the order magnitude problems can be avoided by abandoning the non-physical parameter $\lambda$. The conditions derived by Sorce-Wald can be legitimately used to incorporate the back-reaction effects by avoiding to multiply them by $\lambda^2$, thereby preserving the magnitude of their contribution. We apply this method to the problems of over-charging R-N black holes and over-spinning Kerr black holes, in a rough analysis ignoring absorption probabilities which could apply to test bodies.</description>

      <title>$f(R, T)$ Gravity Bouncing Universe with Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic aim of this manuscript is to investigate the cosmological solutions in the context of the modified $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. For our current work, we consider the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time for finding the solutions of field equations. We investigate the nature of universe by considering acceleration expansion of universe, ultra relativistic universe, sub-relativistic universe, dust universe, radiation universe, stiff universe. Moreover, we apply the power law technique by taking two different $f(R, T)$ gravity models to observe the expanding nature of the universe. The bouncing scenario is also discussed by choosing some particular values of the model parameters and observed the energy conditions, which are satisfied for a successful bouncing model. It is also concluded that some solutions in $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity supports the concept of exotic matter and accelerated expansion of the universe due to a large amount of negative pressure.</description>

      <title>Change of the sign of the Hubble parameter and its stability in higher-order torsion gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the change in the sign of the Hubble parameter in the early universe and its stability in higher-order torsion gravity. Our study explores the various scenarios involving the sub-relativistic universe, radiation universe, ultra-relativistic universe, dust universe, and stiff fluid universe. Different analytical methods, including power-law, exponential scalar factor, and hybrid scale factor methods, are employed to examine the behavior of the universe about the equation of state (EoS) parameters. This study is based on the previous ones by presenting a more comprehensive analysis of the bouncing scenarios within the higher-order torsion gravity framework. It makes significant progress in reconstructing gravitational Lagrangians, which are tailored to specific parameter values, allowing for a thorough examination of the energy conditions necessary for successful bouncing models. These derived Lagrangians provide analytical solutions for a range of bouncing models, including symmetric bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory bounce, matter bounce, and exponential bouncing settings. The presence of exotic matter is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe, as it exhibits substantial negative pressure. A thorough analysis of torsion-based gravity theories and the specific investigations into bouncing scenarios set it apart from previous works exploring alternative gravity theories and their cosmological consequences. These contributions lie in the comprehensive exploration of bouncing models and the detailed examination of the energy conditions in higher-order torsion gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational bremsstrahlung from Yukawa and nucleon collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the gravitational emission from particles scattering via the Yukawa interaction, presenting both classical and approximate quantum results. We also estimate the contribution from the tensor part of the internucleon interaction. This emission is the main source of a very-high frequency component to the stochastic background in the Solar System and in neutron stars. The emission from the Sun (allowing for Debye screening) and from a typical neutron star are obtained. The gravitational wave luminosity of the Sun is $41 \pm 10$ MW.</description>

      <title>Initial data sets with vanishing mass are contained in pp-wave spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1981, Schoen-Yau and Witten showed that in General Relativity both the total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modelling an isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if $m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case. As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.</description>

      <title>KG-particles in a cosmic string rainbow gravity spacetime in mixed magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate and report the effects of rainbow gravity on the spectroscopic structure of KG-oscillators in a mixed magnetic field (in the sense that it has the usually described as a uniform and a non-uniform magnetic fields, each at a time) introduced by the 4-vector potential $A_\mu=(0,0,A_\varphi,0)$, where $A_\varphi=B_1 r^2/2+B_2 r$, and $B_1$ and $B_2$ are magnetic field strengths. We also discuss and report the effects of such a mixed magnetic field on the spectra of KG-oscillators in cosmic string rainbow gravity. In so doing, we introduce a new and quite handy \textit{conditionally exact solution} associated with the truncation of the biconfluent Heun functions into polynomials. Using a loop quantum gravity motivated rainbow functions, we observe interesting effects when the magnetic field strength $B_2$ grows up from zero. Such effects include energy levels crossings which, in this case, turns the spectra of the KG-oscillators upside down. Moreover, Landau-like signature on the spectra are observed and discussed. Yet, interestingly, we also observe that rainbow gravity affects the magnetic field as well, in the sense that the magnetic field becomes probe particle energy-dependent one.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of LRS-BI Universe with $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the Universe as a dynamic system, the understanding of its evolution is an interesting aspect of study in cosmology. Here, we investigate the anisotropic locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-I (LRS-BI) spacetime under the $f(Q)$ gravity of symmetric teleparallel theory equivalent to the GR (STEGR) as a dynamical system and try to understand the role of anisotropy in the evolution of its various phases. For this work, we consider two models, viz., $f(Q) = -\,(Q+ 2\Lambda)$ and $f(Q) = -\, \beta Q^{n}$ to study the critical points and stability of the LRS-BI Universe. In both the models, it is found that the various phases like radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and dark energy-dominated phases are heteroclinically connected, and there is some role of anisotropy in the evolution of these phases of the Universe. However, for both the models, there are some unphysical solutions too depending upon the values of model parameters $\beta$ and $n$ along with the anisotropic parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Testing disformal non-circular deformation of Kerr black holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is strong observational evidence that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. It is of fundamental importance to know whether such black holes are described by the standard Kerr solution in General Relativity (GR) or by another black hole solution. An interesting alternative is the so-called disformal Kerr black holes which exist within the framework of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories of gravity. The departure from the standard Kerr black hole spacetime is parametrized by a parameter $D$, called $\textit{disformal parameter}$. In the present work, we discuss the capability of LISA to detect the disformal parameter. For this purpose, we study Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRI's) around disformal Kerr black holes within the framework of the quadrupole hybrid formalism. Even when the disformal parameter is very small, its effect on the globally accumulated phase of the gravitational waveform of an EMRI can be significant due to the large number of cycles in the LISA band made by the small compact object. We show that LISA will in principle be able to detect and measure extremely small values of the disformal parameter which in turn, can be seen as an assessment of LISA's ability to detect very small deviations from the Kerr geometry.</description>

      <title>Non-Inertial Rigid Frames and the Principle of Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One version of the principle of equivalence, as originally formulated by Einstein, states that ``gravity" can be mimicked locally by going to an ``accelerated frame of reference". As highlighted by Synge, the physical content of this principle remains obscure in so far as it does not refer to the Riemann tensor $R_{abcd}$, which encodes the true effects of gravity. We here give the acceleration profile of a $Born$ rigid, Rindler$esque$, frame that can mimic a gravitational field corresponding to a given $R_{abcd}$. The generalised deviation equation that yields this result also has Centrifugal and Coriolis terms appearing in a purely relational context, yielding a similar connection between angular velocity of rotating, rigid inertial frames and the Riemann tensor. We comment briefly on implications for Mach principle.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic stellar structure in the Fierz--Pauli theory and generic linear massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of static spherical stars composed of non-relativistic matter in linear massive gravity with or without the Fierz-Pauli (FP) tuning. Adopting a polytropic equation of state, we construct master differential equations for the stellar profile function, which is fourth order in the FP theory or sixth order in generic non-FP theories, where the difference in the differential order reflects the presence of a ghost spin-0 graviton in the latter. In both cases, even when the spin-0 ghost is present, we find exact solutions with finite radius for the polytropic indices n = 0 and 1. Analyzing the dependences of the stellar radius, mass, and Yukawa charge on the graviton masses, we observe that a discontinuous behavior arises in the massless limit of the FP theory similarly to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity, while it is absent in non-FP theories. We discuss rough observational constraints on the graviton masses.</description>

      <title>Photon orbits and phase transition for Letelier AdS black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an exact solution of spherically symmetric Letelier AdS black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). Considering the cosmological constant as the positive pressure of the system and volume as its conjugate variable, we analyse the thermodynamics of our black holes in the extended phase space. Owing to the background clouds of strings parameter ($a$) and the parameter endowed with PFDM ($\beta$), we analyse the Hawking temperature, entropy and specific heat. We also investigate the relationship between the photon sphere radius and the phase transition for the Letelier AdS black holes immersed in PFDM. Through the analysis, we find with a particular condition, there are non-monotonic behaviours between the photon sphere radius, the impact parameter, the PFDM parameter, temperature, and pressure. We can regard both the changes of photon sphere radius and impact parameter before and after phase transition as the order parameter; their critical exponents near the critical point are equal to the same value 1/2, just like ordinary thermal systems. These indicate that a universal relation of gravity may exist near the critical point for a black hole thermodynamic system.</description>

      <title>Galactic dynamics in the presence of scalaron: A perspective from $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $f(R)$ modified gravity with the chameleon mechanism as an alternative approach to address the dark matter issue on the galactic scale. Metric formalism of $f(R)$ theory is considered in this study. A mathematical transformation tool called conformal transformation which transforms the action from Jordan to Einstein frame is employed to simplify the fourth-order modified field equation and to describe the extra degree of freedom $f_R$ by using a minimally coupled scalar field (scalaron) showing the chameleonic character. Then, we examine the viability of a newly introduced $f(R)$ gravity model on behalf of the chameleonic behavior of the scalaron. The model analyzes this behavior of the scalaron successfully with the singularity correction. Further, we consider a test particle (star) in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime to investigate the importance of the scalaron in galactic dynamics. In the non-relativistic limit, the rotational velocity equation for the particle with scalaron contribution is derived. This contribution is found to be model dependent. We generate the rotation curves using the velocity equation and fit the predicted curves to observational data of a set of thirty seven sample galaxies of different categories. The curves are fitted based on two fitting parameters $M_0$ and $r_c$. The fitting shows good agreement of the prediction with the observed data.</description>

      <title>Uncovering faint lensed gravitational-wave signals and reprioritizing their follow-up analysis using galaxy lensing forecasts with detected counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like light, gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive astrophysical objects. For galaxy and galaxy-cluster lenses, one expects to see strong lensing -- forecasted to become observable in the coming years -- where the original wave is split into multiple copies with the same frequency evolution but different overall arrival times, phases, amplitudes, and signal strengths. Some of these images can be below the detection threshold and require targeted search methods, based on tailor-made template banks. These searches can be made more sensitive by using our knowledge of the typical distribution and morphology of lenses to predict the time delay, magnification, and image-type ordering of the lensed images. Here, we show that when a subset of the images is super-threshold, they can be used to construct a more constrained prediction of the arrival time of the remaining signals, enhancing our ability to identify lensing candidate signals. Our suggested method effectively reduces the list of triggers requiring follow-up and generally re-ranks the genuine counterpart higher in the lensing candidate list. Therefore, in the future, if one observes two or three lensed images, the information they provide can be used to identify their sub-threshold counterparts, thus allowing identification of additional lensed images. Finding such images would also strengthen our evidence for the event being lensed.</description>

      <title>Coupling elastic media to gravitational waves: an effective field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a gravitational wave (GW) with an elastic body is usually described in terms of a GW "force" driving the oscillations of the body's normal modes. However, this description is only possible for GW frequencies for which the response of the elastic body is dominated by a few normal modes. At higher frequencies the normal modes blend into a quasi-continuum and a field-theoretical description, as pioneered by Dyson already in 1969, becomes necessary. However, since the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ is an intrinsically relativistic object, a consistent coupling to GWs can only be obtained within a relativistic (and, in fact generally covariant) theory of elasticity. We develop such a formalism using the methods of modern effective field theories, and we use it to provide a derivation of the interaction of elastic bodies with GWs valid also in the high-frequency regime, providing a first-principle derivation of Dyson's result (and partially correcting it). We also stress that the field-theoretical results are obtained working in the TT frame, while the description in terms of a force driving the normal modes is only valid in the proper detector frame. We show how to transform the results between the two frames. Beside an intrinsic conceptual interest, these results are relevant to the computation of the sensitivity of the recently proposed Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna.</description>

      <title>Phantom scalar field cosmologies constrained by early cosmic measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore new constraints on phantom scalar field cosmologies with a scalar field employing early times catalogues related to CMB measurements, along with the local standard observables, like Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements (Cosmic Clocks), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) baselines. In particular, we studied a tracker phantom field with hyperbolic polar coordinates that have been proposed in the literature. The main goal is to obtain precise cosmological constraints for $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$, in comparison to other constructions that present tension in early cosmological parameters. Our results show that phantom scalar field cosmologies have a reduced statistical tension on $H_0$ that it is less than 3$\sigma$ using model-independent CMB catalogues as SPT-3G+WMAP9 and ACTPol DR-4+WMAP9 baselines. This suggests these models using a different phantom potential might address the Hubble constant problem and reduce the systematics involved.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitter Momentum Space in 3D and 4D Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been strong interest in the possibility that in the quantum-gravity realm momentum space might be curved, mainly focusing, especially for what concerns phenomenological implications, on the case of a de Sitter momentum space. We here take as starting point the known fact that quantum gravity coupled to matter in $2+1$ spacetime dimensions gives rise to an effective picture characterized by a momentum space with anti-de Sitter geometry, and we point out some key properties of $2+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum space. We observe that it is impossible to implement all of these properties in theories with a $3+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum space, and we then investigate, with the aim of providing guidance to the relevant phenomenology focusing on possible modified laws of conservation of momenta, the implications of giving up, in the $3+1$-dimensional case, some of the properties of the $2+1$-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric configurations in the quadratic $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric configurations of the quadratic $f(R)$ gravity in the Einstein frame. We found the global qualitative behavior of the metric and the scalaron field for all static solutions satisfying the conditions of asymptotic flatness. These solutions are proved to be regular everywhere except for a naked singularity at the center; they are uniquely determined by the total mass $\mathfrak{M}$ and the ``scalar charge'' $Q$ characterizing the strength of the scalaron field at spatial infinity. The case $Q=0$ yields the Schwarzschild solution, but an arbitrarily small $Q\ne 0$ leads to the appearance of a central naked singularity having a significant effect on the neighboring region, even though the space-time metric in the outer region is practically insensitive to the scalaron field. Approximation procedures are developed to derive asymptotic relations near the naked singularity and at spatial infinity, and the leading terms of the solutions are presented. We investigate the linear stability of the static solutions with respect to radial perturbations and numerically estimate the range of parameters corresponding to stable/unstable configurations.</description>

      <title>Influence of primary hair and plasma on intensity distribution of black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of primary hair ($l$) on the shadows of hairy Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes obtained through gravitational decoupling. In the context of hairy Schwarzschild black holes, $l$ either has no effect or consistently enlarges the photon sphere radius. Notably, even when it violates the strong energy condition, it can decrease the radius. For Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, an additional matter field consistently expands the photon sphere radius, potentially reaching $3M$, akin to the pure Schwarzschild case. Remarkably, we demonstrate that black holes can exist even when overcharged ($Q^2 &gt; M^2$), casting shadows. Specific intensity calculations reveal $l$ consistently reduces it in both scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pressureless plasma, finding $l$ exerts a stronger influence on visible size than plasma. These results can help in our understanding of theoretical models of black hole shadows and can be tested by comparison with the images obtained by EHT collaboration.</description>

      <title>Impact of noise transients on gravitational-wave burst detection efficiency of the BayesWave pipeline with multi-detector networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection confidence of the source-agnostic gravitational-wave burst search pipeline BayesWave is quantified by the log signal-versus-glitch Bayes factor, $\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$. A recent study shows that $\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$ increases with the number of detectors. However, the increasing frequency of non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches) in expanded detector networks is not accounted for in the study. Glitches can mimic or mask burst signals resulting in false alarm detections, consequently reducing detection confidence. This paper an empirical study on the impact of false alarms on the overall performance of BayesWave, with expanded detector networks. The noise background of BayesWave for the Hanford-Livingston (HL, two-detector) and Hanford-Livingston-Virgo (HLV, three-detector) networks are measured using a set of non-astrophysical background triggers from the first half of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's Third Observing Run (O3a). Efficiency curves are constructed by combining $\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$ of simulated binary black hole signals with the background measurements, to characterize BayesWave's detection efficiency as a function of the per-trigger false alarm probability. The HL and HLV network efficiency curves are shown to be similar. A separate analysis finds that detection significance of O3 gravitational-wave candidates as measured by BayesWave are also comparable for the HL and HLV networks. Consistent results from the two independent analyses suggests that the overall burst detection performance of BayesWave does not improve with the addition of Virgo at O3a sensitivity, because the increased false alarm probability offsets the advantage of higher $\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light rays in a moving medium around a spherically symmetric gravitating object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most analytical studies of light ray propagation in curved spacetimes around a gravitating object surrounded by a medium, it is assumed that the medium is a cold nonmagnetized plasma. The distinctive feature of this environment is that the equations of motion of the rays are independent of the plasma velocity, which, however, is not the case in other media. In this paper, we consider the deflection of light rays propagating near a spherically symmetric gravitating object in a moving dispersive medium given by a general refractive index. The deflection is studied when the motion of the medium is defined either as a radially falling onto a gravitating object (e.g., black hole), or rotating in the equatorial plane. For both cases the deflection angles are obtained. These examples demonstrate that fully analytic expressions can be obtained if the Hamiltonian for the rays takes a rather general form as a polynomial in a given momentum component. The general expressions are further applied to three specific choices of refractive indices and these cases are compared. Furthermore, the light rays propagating around a gravitating object surrounded by a generally moving medium are further studied as a small perturbation of the cold plasma model. The deflection angle formula is hence expressed as a sum of zeroth and first order components, where the zeroth order term corresponds to the known cold plasma case and the first order correction can be interpreted as caused by small difference in the refractive index compared to the cold plasma. The results presented in this paper allow to describe the effects caused by the motion of a medium and thus go beyond cold nonmagnetized plasma model.</description>

      <title>Generic gravito-magnetic clock effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that two counter-orbiting clocks around a spinning mass differ in the time required to complete the same orbit. The difference in these two values for the orbital period is generally referred to as the gravito-magnetic (GM) clock effect. It has been proposed to measure the GM clock effect using atomic clocks carried by satellites in prograde and retrograde orbits around the Earth. The precision and stability required for satellites to accurately perform this measurement remains a challenge for current instrumentation. One of the most accurate clocks in the Universe is a millisecond pulsar, which emits periodic radio pulses with high stability. Timing of the pulsed signals from millisecond pulsars has proven to be very successful in testing predictions of general relativity and the GM clock effect is potentially measurable in binary systems. In this work we derive the generic GM clock effect by considering a slowly-spinning binary system on an elliptical orbit, with both arbitrary mass ratio and arbitrary spin orientations. The spin-orbit interaction introduces a perturbation to the orbit, causing the orbital plane to precess and nutate. We identify several different contributions to the clock effects: the choice of spin supplementary condition and the observer-dependent definition of a full revolution and "nearly-identical" orbits. We discuss the impact of these subtle definitions on the formula for GM clock effects and show that most of the existing formulae in the literature can be recovered under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Duals from Equations of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holography relates gravitational theories in five dimensions to four-dimensional quantum field theories in flat space. Under this map, the equation of state of the field theory is encoded in the black hole solutions of the gravitational theory. Solving the five-dimensional Einstein's equations to determine the equation of state is an algorithmic, direct problem. Determining the gravitational theory that gives rise to a prescribed equation of state is a much more challenging, inverse problem. We present a novel approach to solve this problem based on physics-informed neural networks. The resulting algorithm is not only data-driven but also informed by the physics of the Einstein's equations. We successfully apply it to theories with crossovers, first- and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

      <title>Straightforward mode hierarchy in eccentric binary black hole mergers and associated waveform model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing publicly available non-spinning eccentric binary black hole (BBH) merger simulations (\href{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html}{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html}) from the SXS collaboration~\cite{Hinder:2017sxy}, we present convincing evidence that the waveform phenomenology in eccentric BBH mergers is significantly simpler than previously thought. We find that the eccentric modulations in the amplitudes, phases, and frequencies in different spherical harmonic modes are all related and can be modeled using a single time series modulation. Using this universal eccentric modulation, we provide a model named \texttt{gwNRHME} to seamlessly convert a multi-modal (i.e with several spherical harmonic modes) quasi-circular waveform into multi-modal eccentric waveform if the quadrupolar eccentric waveform is known. This reduces the modelling complexity of eccentric BBH mergers drastically as we now have to model only a single eccentric modulation time-series instead of modelling the effect of eccentricity in all modes. When compared with the NR simulations, our model mismatches are mostly $\sim 10^{-3}$ and are comparable to the numerical errors in the NR simulations. Our method is modular and can be readily added to any quadrupolar non-spinning eccentric waveform model. We make our model publicly available through the \texttt{gwModels} (\href{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels}{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels}) waveform package.</description>

This research is a proposal to the proof of concept that through the Einstein-Rosen bridge (also known as wormhole) the information can travel between two points %through quantum mechanical phenomenon, Hawking radiation thus proving the classical entanglement connection between two spatially distant points which are not causally connected.

Abstract: We demonstrate that gravitational particle production (GPP) of a massive, Abelian, vector (Proca) field during inflation in the presence of nonminimal coupling to gravity may suffer from an instability which leads to runaway production of high-momentum modes. This is untenable unless there is some mechanism to regulate the runaway. We discuss the parameter space of the particle mass and nonminimal couplings where such a runaway occurs and possible ways to tame the runaway. We find that there is no obvious way to resolve the runaway in a UV completion or with kinetic mixing to the standard model.</description>

      <title>Metric-affine cosmological models and the inverse problem of the calculus of variations. Part 1: variational bootstrapping -- the method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of variational completion allows one to transform an (in principle, arbitrary) system of partial differential equations -- based on an intuitive ``educated guess'' -- into the Euler-Lagrange one attached to a Lagrangian, by adding a canonical correction term. Here, we extend this technique to theories that involve at least two sets of dynamical variables : we show that an educated guess of the field equations with respect to one of these sets of variables only is sufficient to variationally complete these equations and recover a Lagrangian for the full theory, up to terms that do not involve the respective variables.
  Applying this idea to natural metric-affine theories of gravity, we prove that, starting from an educated guess of the metric equations only, one can find the full metric equations, together with a generally covariant Lagrangian for the theory, up to metric-independent terms; the latter terms (which can only involve the distortion of the connection) are then completely classified over 4-dimensional spacetimes, by techniques pertaining to differential invariants.</description>

      <title>The Non-triviality of Dynamical Chern-Simons Gravity and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the growing interest in gravitational-wave and cosmological parity-violating effects in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, it is crucial to investigate whether the scalar-gravitational Pontryagin term in dCS persists when formulated in the context of the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$ anomaly in the Standard Model (SM). In particular, it has been argued that dCS gravity can be reduced to Einstein gravity after ''rotating away'' the gravitational-Pontryagin coupling into the phase of the Weinberg operator $\unicode{x2013}$ analogous to the rotation of the axion zero-mode into the quark mass matrix. We find that dCS is nontrivial if the scalar field $\phi$ has significant space-time dependence from dynamics. We provide a comprehensive consideration of the dCS classical and quantum symmetries relevant for embedding a dCS sector in the SM. We find that, because of the B-L chiral gravitational anomaly, the scalar-Pontryagin term cannot be absorbed by a field redefinition. Assuming a minimal extension of the SM, we also find that a coupling of the dCS scalar with right-handed neutrinos induces both the scalar-Pontryagin coupling and an axion-like phase in the dimension-five Weinberg operator. We comment on the issue of gauging the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$, the observational effects with these two operators present for upcoming experiments, and the origin of dCS gravity in string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a possible quantum signature of the early Universe that could lead to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period. Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the intrinsic alignment.</description>

Abstract: Intensity interferometry is a technique developed many decades ago, that has recently enjoyed a renaissance thanks in part to advances in photodetector technology. We investigate the potential for long-baseline optical intensity interferometry to observe bright, active galactic nuclei (AGN) associated with rapidly accreting supermassive black holes. We argue that realistic telescope arrays similar in area to existing Cherenkov arrays, if equipped with modern high-precision single photon detectors, can achieve a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio not only to detect distant AGN, but also to study them in great detail. We explore the science potential of such observations by considering two examples. First, we find that intensity interferometric observations of bright nearby AGN can allow detailed studies of the central accretion disks powering the AGN, allowing reconstruction of many disk properties like the radial profile. Next, we argue that intensity interferometers can spatially resolve the broad-line regions of AGN at cosmological distances, and thereby provide a geometric determination of the angular diameter distances to those AGN when combined with reverberation mapping. Since this measurement can be performed for AGN at distances of hundreds of megaparsecs, this directly measures the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, with a precision adequate to resolve the recent Hubble tension. Finally, we speculate on future applications that would be enabled by even larger intensity interferometer arrays.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves from the inflation potential with a tiny bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from the inflation potential with a tiny bump. We propose a Lorentz function that makes a tiny bump characteristic of the inflation model potential. This property makes the scalar field move locally ultra slowly, which not only makes the primordial curvature power spectrum have $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ peaks at a small scale but also satisfies observational constraints of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on a large scale. Specifically, we calculate the abundances of PBHs for different mass ranges in this model, where PBHs with mass $10^{-12}M_\odot$ can make up almost all dark matter and PBHs with mass $10^{-5}M_\odot$ can explain OGLE ultrashort-timescale microlensing events. Moreover, we find that SIGWs accompanying the PBHs can be tested by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), TianQin, Taiji, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and DECIGO. As for the parameter set I, the consequent SIGWs can explain the NANOGrav 12.5yrs signal.</description>

      <title>Roles of boundary and equation-of-motion terms in cosmological correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the properties of total time-derivative terms as well as terms proportional to the free equation of motion (EOM) in a Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. They are relevant to the correct calculation of correlation functions of curvature perturbations in the context of inflationary Universe. We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the operator or the path-integral formalism, but they give the same correlation functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments on loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars -- Paper I: Structure, shape and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full general relativistic analytic solution for a radiation-pressure supported equilibrium fluid torus orbiting a rotating neutron star (NS). Previously developed analytical methods are thoroughly applied in the Hartle-Thorne geometry, including the effects of both the NS's angular momentum and quadrupole moment. The structure, size and shape of the torus are explored, focusing especially on the critically thick solution - the cusp tori. For the astrophysically relevant range of NS parameters, we examine how our findings differ from those obtained for the Schwarzschild spacetime. The solutions for rotating stars display signatures of the interplay between relativistic and Newtonian effects where the impact of NS angular momentum and quadrupole moment are almost counterbalanced at the given radius. Nevertheless, the spacetime parameters still strongly influence the size of tori, which can be shown in a coordinate-independent way. Finally, we discuss the importance of the size of the central neutron star, determining whether or not the surrounding torus may exist. We provide a set of tools in a Wolfram Mathematica code, which poses a basis allowing for a further investigation of the impact of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state on the spectral and temporal behaviour of accretion tori.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars -- Paper II: Oscillations and precessions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The four characteristic oscillation frequencies of accretion flows are, in addition to the Keplerian orbital frequency, often discussed in the context of the time variability of the black hole and neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). These are namely the frequencies of the axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations, and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the periastron (radial) and Lense-Thirring (vertical) precessions. In this context, we investigate the effect of the quadrupole moment of a slowly rotating NS and provide complete formulae for calculating these oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their convenient approximations. Simple formulae corresponding to the geodesic limit of a slender torus (and test particle motion) and the limit of a marginally overflowing torus (torus exhibiting a critical cusp) are presented, and furthermore, more general approximate formulae are included to allow calculations for arbitrarily thick tori. We provide the Wolfram Mathematica code used for our calculations together with C++ and PYTHON codes for calculations of the frequencies. Our formulae can be used for various calculations describing the astrophysical signatures of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state. For instance, we demonstrate that, even for a given fixed number of free parameters, a model accounting for fluid flow precession better matches the frequencies of twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations observed in NS LMXBs than a model using geodesic precession.</description>

      <title>Canonical Quantization of the U(1) Gauge Field in the Rindler Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field across all four regions in the Rindler coordinates in the Lorentz covariant gauge. In the four regions (future, past, left and right Rindler-wedges) in the Rindler coordinates, defining the gauge-fixed Lagrangian in the Lorentz covariant gauge, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field, the $B$-field and ghost fields. Since the U(1) gauge and $B$-fields are decoupled from the ghost fields by the property of the U(1) gauge theory, the U(1) gauge field and the $B$-field are examined in this study.
  Then, by solving the equations of motion obtained from the gauge-fixed Lagrangian, the solutions of each mode of the U(1) gauge field and the $B$-field can be obtained. Following this, with the Klein-Gordon inner-product defined in the Rindler coordinates, the normalization constants of each of those mode-solutions are determined.
  Subsequently, formulating the canonical commutation relations of the U(1) gauge field and its canonical conjugate momentum, the commutation relations of the coefficient of each mode-solution in each direction of the U(1) gauge field in each region of the Rindler coordinates are obtained. From these, it can be seen that those coefficients have physical meaning as creation/annihilation operators. The polarization vectors in each region of the Rindler coordinates are also given in this study.
  From these, it is shown that the Minkowski ground state can be given as the outer-product of the quantum states multiplied by the creation operators of the U(1) gauge field in the left and right Rindler-wedge states.
  Then, obtaining the density matrix of the U(1) gauge theory in the right Rindler-wedge from that, it is shown that the U(1) gauge field in the constant accelerated system feels the Unruh temperature as well.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

      <title>A classical Bousso bound for higher derivative corrections to general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the classical version of the covariant entropy bound (also known as the Bousso bound) in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant gravitational theories. We focus on theories for which the higher derivative terms are considered as small corrections in the Lagrangian to Einstein's two-derivative theory of general relativity (GR). Even if the higher derivative corrections are treated perturbatively, we provide instances of specific configurations for which they can potentially violate the Bousso bound. To tackle this obstruction, we propose a modification in the Bousso bound that incorporates the offending contributions from the higher derivative corrections. Our proposed modifications are equivalent to replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking area term by Wald's definition (with dynamical corrections as suggested by Wall) for the black hole entropy. Hence, the modifications are physically well motivated by results from the laws of black hole mechanics in higher derivative theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cayley Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most natural first-order PDE's to be imposed on a Cayley 4-form in eight dimensions is the condition that it is closed. As is known, this implies integrability of the Spin(7) structure defined by the Cayley form, as well as Ricci-flatness of the associated metric. We address the question as to what the most natural second-order in derivatives set of conditions is. We start by constructing the most general diffeomorphism invariant second order in derivatives Lagrangian that is quadratic in the perturbations of the Cayley form. We find that there is a one-parameter family of such Lagrangians. We then describe a non-linear completion of the linear story. To this end, we parametrise the intrinsic torsion of a Spin(7) structure by a 3-form, and show that this 3-form is completely determined by the exterior derivative of the Cayley form. We construct an action functional, which depends on the Cayley 4-form and and auxiliary 3-form as independent variables. There is a unique functional whose Euler-Lagrange equation for the auxiliary 3-form states that it is equal to the torsion 3-form. There is, however, a more general one-parameter family of functionals that can be constructed, and we show how the linearisation of these functionals reproduces the linear story. For any member of our family of theories, the Euler-Lagrange equations are written only using the operator of exterior differentiation of forms, and do not require the knowledge of the metric-compatible Levi-Civita connection. Geometrically, there is a preferred member in the family of Lagrangians, and we propose that its Euler-Lagrange equations are the most natural second-order equations to be satisfied by Cayley forms. Our construction also leads to a natural geometric flow in the space of Cayley forms, defined as the gradient flow of our action functional.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the extrinsic $Q$-curvature admits a decomposition into the Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic $Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.</description>

Abstract: We investigate possible configurations for vacuum multi-black holes that maintain static equilibrium in expanding bubbles. Our analysis assumes a five-dimensional Weyl metric to describe the spacetime, facilitating the derivation of solutions based on the provided rod structure. We consider a spacetime having expanding bubbles caused by one or two acceleration horizons, and show that various configurations such as two bubbles, four bubbles devoid of horizons, a black saturn, a black di-ring, a bicycling black ring (orthogonal black di-ring), and a five-dimensional black hole binary can achieve equilibrium within expanding bubbles. Specifically, we demonstrate that equilibrium requires two acceleration horizons on both sides for the bicycling ring and the five-dimensional black hole binary. However, only one acceleration horizon is necessary for achieving equilibrium in the case of the black saturn and the black di-ring.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Regularization of the Graviton Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the details for the covariant renormalization of the stress tensor for vacuum tensor perturbations at the level of the effective action, adopting Hadamard regularization techniques to isolate short distance divergences and gauge fixing via the Faddeev-Popov procedure. The subsequently derived renormalized stress tensor can be related to more familiar forms reliant upon an averaging prescription, such as the Isaacson or Misner-Thorne-Wheeler forms. The latter, however, are premised on a prior scale separation (beyond which the averaging is invoked) and therefore unsuited for the purposes of renormalization. This can lead to potentially unphysical conclusions when taken as a starting point for the computation of any observable that needs regularization, such as the energy density associated to a stochastic background. Any averaging prescription, if needed, should only be invoked at the end of the renormalization procedure. The latter necessarily involves the imposition of renormalization conditions via a physical measurement at some fixed scale, which we retrace for primordial gravitational waves sourced from vacuum fluctuations through direct or indirect observation.</description>

      <title>The interacting double white dwarf population with LISA; stochastic foreground and resolved sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of tidal torques and mass transfer on the population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that will be observed with LISA. Starting from a distribution of DWDs at formation predicted by numerical simulations, we use a semi-analytical model to evolve DWDs under different hypotheses for the efficiency of tidal coupling and the birth spins of white dwarfs. We then estimate the stochastic foreground and the population of resolvable binaries for LISA in each scenario. Our predicted DWD binary distribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only gravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we predict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral after the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences in the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In that case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in the GW-only scenario. If instead white dwarfs spin rapidly and tidal coupling is weak, then we find no excess around a few mHz, and the confusion noise due to DWDs is very small. In that scenario, we also predict a subpopulation of outspiralling binaries below 0.1 mHz. Using the Fisher matrix approximation, we estimate the uncertainty on the GW-frequency derivative of resolvable systems. We estimate that, even for non-accreting systems, the mismodelling error due to neglect of effects other than GWs is larger than the statistical uncertainty, and thus this neglect would lead to biased estimates for mass and distance. Our results highlight the need for flexible tools in LISA data analysis. Because our semi-analytical model hinges upon a simplistic approach to determining the stability of mass accretion it will be important to deepen our comprehension of stability in mass-transferring DWD binaries.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Finslerian wormhole solution in the framework of modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the properties of a wormhole model in a specific gravity theory, namely $f(Ric, T)=Ric+2\lambda T$. The wormhole solution is analyzed using an exponential shape function. The study examines various parameters, such as density, radial pressure, transverse pressure, equation-of-state parameters, and energy conditions, within the framework of deformed gravity. The research emphasizes the influence of the parameter $\lambda$ on energy condition violations and the equilibrium state of the Finslerian wormhole solution. These effects are attributed to anisotropic and hydrostatic forces present in modified gravity. The study demonstrates that the gravity model effectively captures the characteristics of wormholes within the Finslerian space-time. Additionally, the identified features of the wormhole are utilized to visualize its structure by creating a three-dimensional representation of the embedded surface. In summary, this research contributes to understanding wormholes in modified gravity theories, highlighting the importance of the parameter $\lambda$ in determining their behavior and properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily negligible at early times.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation with a Gauss-Bonnet term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higgs inflation with a Gauss-Bonnet term is studied in the Einstein frame. Our model features two coupling functions, $\Omega^2(\phi)$ and $\omega(\phi)$, coupled to the Ricci scalar and Gauss-Bonnet combinations. We found a special relation $\Omega^2 \propto \omega$ sets the system a lot more simplified; therefore, we take it for granted in our analytical studies. As a result of a Weyl transformation to the Einstein frame, we notice the emergence of new interactions: a non-minimal kinetic coupling between the scalar field and gravity and a derivative self-interaction of the scalar field. In the Einstein frame, we investigate the cosmological implications of these interactions by deriving the background equation of motion and observable quantities. Our numerical result on $n_S$ vs. $r$ suggests our model is consistent with the observational data for a wide range of the model parameter, $-1.4\times 10^4\lesssim \alpha \equiv \frac{\omega}{\Omega^2} \lesssim 8\times 10^3$, where both the positive and negative values of $\alpha$ are allowed. As the Gauss-Bonnet contributions decay away with time after inflation, the propagation speed of gravitational waves turned out to be consistent with the recent constraints on the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs) without inducing ghost instability.</description>

      <title>Alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions in Tsallis cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present how Tsallis cosmology can alleviate both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions simultaneously. Such a modified cosmological scenario is obtained by the application of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, but using the non-additive Tsallis entropy, instead of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking one. Hence, one obtains modified Friedmann equations, with extra terms that depend on the new Tsallis exponent $\delta$ that quantifies the departure from standard entropy. We show that for particular $\delta$ choices we can obtain a phantom effective dark energy, which is known to be one of the sufficient mechanisms that can alleviate $H_0$ tension. Additionally, for the same parameter choice we obtain an increased friction term and an effective Newton's constant smaller than the usual one, and thus the $\sigma_8$ tension is also solved. These features act as a significant advantage of Tsallis modified cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Einstein-Hilbert action in two dimensions is topological and yields an identically vanishing Einstein tensor. Consequently one is faced with difficulties when formulating a non-trivial gravity model. We present a new, intrinsically two-dimensional, approach to this problem based on the Einstein action. This yields a well defined variational approach which results in new field equations that break diffeomorphism invariance. Our proposed approach does not require the introduction of additional scalar fields, nor the use of conformal transformations. However, we can show how including conformal counter terms leads to equivalent results. In doing so, we can provide an explanation for why previous approaches worked. Solutions to the field equations are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that any mathematical solution for null electromagnetic field knots in flat spacetime is also a null field knotted solution for cosmological electromagnetic fields. This is obtained by replacing the time $t\rightarrow \tau=\int dt/a$, where $a=a(t)$ is the scale factor of the Universe described by the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology, and by adequately rewriting the (empty flat spacetimes) electromagnetic fields solutions in a medium defined by the FLRW metric. We found that the dispersion (evolution) of electromagnetic Hopfions is faster on cosmological scenarios.
  We discuss the implications of these results for different cosmological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order scalar-tensor theories having an instantaneous mode do not develop the Ostrogradsky instability even if a seemingly dangerous mode is present. Such theories satisfy only partially the degeneracy conditions that are usually imposed to remove the dangerous mode completely, and are dubbed as U-DHOST theories. We study weak gravitational fields sourced by nonrelativistic matter distributions in U-DHOST theories. In contrast to the case of totally degenerate theories where nonlinear derivative interactions are crucial for exhibiting the Vainshtein mechanism and its partial breaking, we show that in generic U-DHOST theories the linear analysis is sufficient for weak gravitational fields. We identify the subset of U-DHOST theories in which solar system tests are evaded and gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. Such theories can however be tested with cosmological observations. We also point out that there is a particular case of U-DHOST theories where nonlinear derivative interactions play an important role as in totally degenerate theories. In that case, it is found, however, that the Vainshtein mechanism does not operate and gravitational forces are modified.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation. Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.</description>

Abstract: The detection of low-frequency gravitational waves on Earth requires the reduction of displacement noise, which dominates the low-frequency band. One method to cancel test mass displacement noise is a neutron displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI). This paper proposes a new neutron DFI configuration, a Sagnac-type neutron DFI, which uses a Sagnac interferometer in place of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We demonstrate that a sensitivity of the Sagnac-type neutron DFI is higher than that of a conventional neutron DFI with the same interferometer scale. This configuration is particularly significant for neutron DFIs with limited space for construction and limited flux from available neutron sources.</description>

Abstract: GW200129 is claimed to be the first-ever observation of the spin-disk orbital precession detected with gravitational waves (GWs) from an individual binary system. However, this claim warrants a cautious evaluation because the GW event coincided with a broadband noise disturbance in LIGO Livingston caused by the 45 MHz electro-optic modulator system. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art neural network that is able to model and mitigate the broadband noise from the LIGO Livingston interferometer. We also demonstrate that our neural network mitigates the noise better than the algorithm used by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Finally, we re-analyse GW200129 with the improved data quality and show that the evidence for precession is still observed.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we obtain an expression for the total observational frequency shift of photons emitted by massive geodesic particles circularly orbiting a black hole in a general spherically symmetric background. Our general relations are presented in terms of the metric components and their derivatives that characterize the black hole parameters. As a concrete example of this general relativistic approach, a special case is studied by applying the formalism to a nonsingular black hole conformally related to the Schwarzchild solution that possesses a length scale parameter $l$ and an integer parameter $N$ in addition to the black hole mass. Besides, we express the nonsingular black hole mass in terms of the observational redshift/blueshift. Finally, we investigate the effects of the free parameters of the conformal gravity theory on the observational frequency shift and compare results with those of the standard Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

Abstract: We discuss refinement criteria for the Berger-Rigoutsos (block-based) refinement algorithm in our numerical relativity code GR-Athena++ in the context of binary black hole merger simulations. We compare three different strategies: the "box-in-box" approach, the "sphere-in-sphere" approach and a local criterion for refinement based on the estimation of truncation error of the finite difference scheme. We extract and compare gravitational waveforms using the three different mesh refinement methods and compare their accuracy against a calibration waveform and demonstrate that the sphere-in-sphere approach provides the best strategy overall when considering computational cost and the waveform accuracy. Ultimately, we demonstrate the capability of each mesh refinement method in accurately simulating gravitational waves from binary black hole systems -- a crucial aspect for their application in next-generation detectors. We quantify the mismatch achievable with the different strategies by extrapolating the gravitational wave mismatch to higher resolution.</description>

Abstract: We study conformal transformations in the most general parity-preserving models of the New General Relativity type. Then we apply them to analysis of cosmological perturbations in the (simplest) spatially flat cosmologies. Strong coupling issues around Minkowski spacetime are seen for many special cases of these models. At the same time, the behaviour of the most general three-parameter case seems to be very robust, presumably always with only the eight first-class constraints coming from diffeomorphisms. Also the case of the so-called 1-parameter New GR doesn't show any discontinuity between Minkowski and the cosmology, though without showing any deviations from GR which would be observable at this level either.</description>

      <title>Images of hairy Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole illuminated by static accretions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow and optical appearance of the hairy Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole illuminated by two toy models of static accretion. The hairy RN black hole was constructed in the gravitation decoupling approach to describe the deformation of a Schwarzschild black hole due to the inclusion of additional arbitrary source (scalar field, tensor field, fluidlike dark matter, etc). So it is characterized by the parameters: mass ($M$), deformation factor ($\alpha$), electric charge ($Q$) and the additional hairy charge ($l_o$), differentiating from the case in RN black hole. Though the specific background theory that results in this hairy RN black hole is still tricky, here we shall focus on the novel observable features introduced by the hair of this black hole. First, we find that for the hairy RN black hole, the event horizon, radius of photon sphere and critical impact parameter all increase as the increasings of $Q$ and $l_o$, but decrease as $\alpha$ grows. The three characterized parameters are found to have significant effects on the photon trajectories, shadows and images of hairy RN black hole surrounded by the static accretion disk and spherical accretion, respectively. Particularly, both $Q$ and $l_o$ have mutually reinforcing effects on the optical appearance and shadows of the hairy RN black hole, which implies that we may not distinguish the electric charge and hairy charge from the shadow and image of black hole in this scenario. Additionally, because of the competing effects of the charge parameters ($Q, l_o$) and the deviation parameter $\alpha$ on the observed intensities of brightness, the optical appearance between the hairy RN black hole and RN black hole could have degeneracies, indicating the indistinguishability. Our current results contribute more to the phenomenal aspects which could be helpful to build the background theory of hairy RN black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light rays passing very close to black holes may wind several times before escaping. For any given electromagnetic source around the black hole, a distant observer would thus observe two infinite sequences of images on either side of the black hole. These images are generated by light rays performing an increasing numbers of loops. The strong deflection limit provides a simple analytic formalism to describe such higher order images for spherically symmetric metrics, while for axially symmetric black holes one typically resorts to numerical approaches. Here we present the leading order perturbation to higher order images when the black hole spin is turned on. We show that the images slide around the black hole shadow as an effect of space-time dragging. We derive analytical formulae for their shifts and the perturbation of their time delays. We also discuss how such simple analytical formulae for images by Kerr black holes can be of great help in many applications.</description>

      <title>Topology of dyonic AdS black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the thermodynamic topological method to classify critical points for the dyonic AdS black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet background. To this end, we find a small/large black hole phase transition in all dimensions of space-time, the existence of a conventional critical point implies a total topological charge of $Q_t=-1$. The coupling constant $\alpha$ gives rise to a more intricate phase structure, with the emergence of a triple points requires $\alpha\geq0.5$ and $d=6$. Interestingly, the condition for the occurrence of small/intermediate/large phase transition is that the coupling constant a takes a special value ($\alpha=0.5$), the two conventional critical points $CP_{1},CP_{2}$ of the black hole are physical critical point, and the novel critical point $CP_{3}$ that lacks the capability to minimize the Gibbs free energy. The critical points $CP_{1}$ and $CP_{2}$ are observed to occur at the maximum extreme points of temperature in the isobaric curve, while the critical point $CP_{3}$, emerges at the minimum extreme points of temperature. Furthermore, the number of phases at the novel critical point exhibits an upward trend, followed by a subsequent decline at the conventional critical points. With the increase of the coupling constant ($\alpha = 1$), although the system has three critical points, only the conventional $CP_{1}$ is a (physical) critical point, and the conventional $CP_{2}$ serves as the phase annihilation point. This means that the coupling constant $\alpha$ has a non-negligible effect on the phase structure.</description>

      <title>Global Analysis of LISA Data with Galactic Binaries and Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We perform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with an observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise with each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally, we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>

      <title>The mass-to-distance ratio for a set of megamaser AGN black holes by employing a general relativistic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Motivated by recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in determining black hole (BH) parameters, we continue to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the supermassive BHs hosted at the core of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of NGC 1320, NGC 1194, NGC 5495, and Mrk 1029.
  Aims .To study the properties of SMBHs at the centers of selected AGNs by a full general relativistic method which allows us to address the potential detection of relativistic effects within such astrophysical systems.
  Methods. In order to perform statistical estimations with publicly available observational data, we use a general relativistic model that describes black hole rotation curves and further employ a Bayesian fitting method.
  Results. We estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the aforementioned BHs, their $x_0$-offset as well as the recessional redshifts of the host galaxies produced by both peculiar motion and cosmological expansion of the Universe. Finally, we calculate the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to the BH for each AGN. This gravitational redshift is a general relativistic effect produced by the gravitational field of the BH properly included in the modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the applications of twisted spectral triples to the Standard Model. The initial motivation was to generate a scalar field, required to stabilise the electroweak vacuum and fit the Higgs mass, while respecting the first-order condition. Ultimately, it turns out that the truest interest of the twist lies in a new -- and unexpected -- field of 1-forms, which is related to the transition from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>Space-based Gravitational Wave Observatories Will Be Able to Use Eccentricity to Unveil Stellar-mass Binary Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of eccentricity would provide strong constraints on the formation channel of stellar-mass binary black holes. However, current ground-based gravitational wave detectors will, in most cases, not be able to measure eccentricity due to orbital circularization. Space-based observatories, in contrast, can determine binary eccentricity at 0.01Hz to $e_{0.01}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}) $. Directly observing stellar-mass binary black holes with space-based observatories remains a challenging problem. However, observing such systems with ground-based detectors allows the possibility to identify the same signal in archival data from space-based observatories in the years previous. Since ground-based detectors provide little constraints on eccentricity, including eccentricity in the archival search will increase the required number of filter waveforms for the archival search by 5 orders of magnitudes [from $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^8)$], and will correspondingly need $ \sim8\times10^5 $ core hours (and $ \sim 10^5$ GB of memory), even for a mild upper limit on eccentricity of $0.1$. In this work, we have constructed the first template bank for an archival search of space-based gravitational wave detectors, including eccentricity. We have demonstrated that even though the inclusion of eccentricity brings extra computational burden, an archival search including eccentricity will be feasible in the time frame of planned space-based observatories, and will provide strong constraints on the eccentricities of stellar-mass binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Possible ambient kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond classified kinematical algebras, a class of Lie algebras encoding the symmetries of spacetime. Homogeneous spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated to these possible kinematics can be partitioned into four families -- riemannian, lorentzian, galilean and carrollian -- based on the type of invariant metric structure they admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics -- defined as extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal -- as well as their associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique -- trivial and torsion-free -- higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian Klein pairs.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectra of Holographic Quasinormal Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes and frequencies are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian differential operator. They hold crucial significance in the physics of black holes. The analysis of quasinormal modes of black holes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter geometries plays also a key role in the study of strongly coupled quantum many-body systems via gauge/gravity duality. In contrast to normal Sturm-Liouville operators, the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian (and non-normal) operators generally exhibit instability under small perturbations. This research focuses on the stability analysis of quasinormal frequencies pertaining to asymptotically planar AdS black holes, employing pseudospectrum analysis. Specifically, we concentrate on the pseudospectra of scalar and transverse gauge fields, shedding light on their relevance within the framework of gauge/gravity duality.</description>

      <title>Broken blue-tilted inflationary gravitational waves: a joint analysis of NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hertz band. The spectrum of inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) is unknown, which might exhibit different power law at different frequency-bands, thus if the PTA signal is primordial, it will be significant to explore the underlying implications of current PTA and CMB data on IGW. In this paper, we perform a joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for a broken power-law spectrum of IGW with the NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data. It is found that though the bestfit spectral tilt of IGW at PTA band is $n^\text{PTA}_\text{T} =2.42^{+0.32}_{-0.91}$, at CMB band the bestfit is $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} =0.55^{+0.37}_{-0.10}$ while a detectable amplitude of $r$ with $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} \simeq 0$ is still compatible. The implication of our results for inflation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous baryogenesis and generation of gravitational waves in a new model of quintessential $\alpha$-attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of $\alpha$-parameter of the newly proposed model of quintessential $\alpha$-attractor inflation (arXiv: 2305.00230 [gr-qc]) to the case of quintessential spontaneous baryogenesis and generation of relic gravitational waves in presence of a rolling scalar field during kination. An \textit{effective 4-Fermi construct} technique has been employed to compute the freeze-out temperature and the baryon-to-entropy ratio, of which the obtained results conform to the experimental requirements for $0.28\leq\alpha\leq 0.30$. This range of $\alpha$ is found to originate from the functional behaviour of the end-value expression of the potential concerned. We also find a blue-tilted gravitational wave spectrum during a transition from inflation to kination. The amplitudes of the gravitational waves during radiation domination satisfy the constraint for nucleosynthesis and the characteristic strain of the ongoing gravitational wave detectors. Thus, the most important observation emerged from the present study is that, increasingly small fractional values of $\alpha$ are favourable for unification of inflation, baryogenesis, quintessence and gravitational waves within a single model. This could have an interesting connection with the fundamental origin of $\alpha$-attractor.</description>

      <title>Toward More Realistic Mass Functions For Ultradense Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs) are high concentrations of dark matter, assumed to have formed deep in the radiation-dominated era from amplified primordial perturbations. In this work we improve the previous works for the calculation of UDMH abundance by elaborating on the formation process of these halos by including various physical and geometrical modifications in the analysis. In particular, we investigate the impact of angular momentum, dynamical friction and triaxial collapse on the predicted mass functions for UDMHs. We perform the calculations for four primordial power spectra with different amplified features that allow for primordial black hole and UDHM formation in wide and narrow mass ranges. We also apply this analysis in the context of two possible scenarios for dark matter: the single-component and the multi-component. We find that the abundance of UDMHs is prominently enhanced in the presence of these more realistic mass functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the mathematics of exactly solvable Unruh-DeWitt detector models, interacting with massless scalar fields under instantaneous interactions, to construct a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine. By deriving the conditions under which the thermodynamic cycle is closed we study the effects of motion on the amount of work that can be extracted from the machine when the working medium is moving at a constant relativistic velocity through the heat baths. While there is a degrading effect with respect to speed in the hot bath, we demonstrate that in the case of the cold bath, genuine enhancing effects are sometimes present. For couplings the same order as the inverse frequency of the detector and a specific value for the temporal separation between the two instantaneous interactions--needed in order to be possible to cool the detector--a non-monotonic dependence between speed and extracted work exists raising the intriguing possibility of exploiting relativistic effects for the enhancement of thermodynamic processes in tabletop experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing hydrodynamic formalisms, which in order to be causal and stable, (i) either requires to promote the `non-fluid' variables as the new degrees of freedom apart from the velocity and temperature, or (ii) needs to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the ones given by Landau and Eckart. We have rewritten the BDNK stress tensor (originally in the general frame) into the Landau frame by redefining the fluid variables such as velocity ($u^{\mu}$) and temperature ($T$) via a hydrodynamic frame transformation. This `fluid frame' transformation includes shift variables $\delta u^{\mu}$ and $\delta T$, which are small enough to be treated linearly but encompass all orders of gradient corrections. The redefinition indicates that though the BDNK formalism has a finite number of derivatives, in the Landau frame, it will either have an infinite number of derivatives or one has to resum them by introducing new `non-fluid' variables much like the MIS theory. The infinite derivative series are summed in two different ways that lead to two different methods of `integrating in' new `non-fluid' variables, showing the non-uniqueness of the process of `integrating in' new variables. Finally, the dispersion relations and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Testing a new general diffractive formula with gravitational wave source lensed by a supermassive black hole in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For long wavelength gravitational wave (GW), it is easy to diffract when it is lensed by celestial objects. Traditional diffractive integral formula has ignored large angle diffraction, which is adopted in most of cases. However, in some special cases (e. g. a GW source lensed by a supermassive black hole in a binary system, where the lens is close to the source), large angle diffraction could be important. Our previous works have proposed a new general diffractive integral formula which is also valid for large angle diffraction case. In this paper, we have investigated how much difference between this general diffractive formula and traditional diffractive integral formula could be under these special cases with different parameters. We find that the module of amplification factor for general diffractive formula could become smaller than that of traditional diffractive integral basically with a factor $r_F\simeq0.806$ when the distance between lens and sources is $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU and lens mass $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$. Their difference is so significant that it is detectable. Furthermore, we find that the proportionality factor $r_F$ is gradually increasing from 0.5 to 1 with increasing $D_{\rm LS}$ and it is decreasing with increasing $M_{\rm L}$. As long as $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim0.2$ AU (with $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$) or $M_{\rm L}\gtrsim2\times10^6M_\odot$ (with $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU ), the difference between new and traditional formulas is enough significant to be detectable. It is promising to test this new general diffractive formula in the future GW detection.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from JWST and NANOGrav</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the recent statistics of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently -- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.</description>

Abstract: We consider $(1+1)$-dimensional dilatonic black hole with two horizons, canonical temperatures of which do not coincide. We show that the presence of quantum fields in such a background leads to a substantial backreaction on the metric: 2D dilatonic analog of the semiclassical Einstein equations are solved self-consistently, and we demonstrate that taking into account of backreaction leads to a geometry with two horizons with coinciding temperatures.</description>

      <title>Absence of torsion : Clue from Starobinsky model of f(R) gravity</title>

Abstract: One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any noticeable observable effects of higher-rank anti-symmetric tensor fields, such as space-time torsion, in any natural phenomena. Here we address the possible explanation of torsion, which may often be identified with the field strength tensor of the second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field. Within the framework of f(R) gravity, we explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general higher curvature model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while the values of different cosmological parameters follow acceptable values in the framework of standard cosmology at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity (i.e. different values of n ), only for Starobinsky model (n = 2), the Kalb Ramond field gets naturally suppressed with cosmological evolution. In contrast, for other models (n both positive and negative), despite their agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar field associated with the higher derivative degree of freedom induces an enhancement in Kalb-Ramond field and thereby contradicts the observation. The result does not change even if we include the Cosmological Constant. Thus our result reveals that among different $f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of space-time torsion along with a consistent cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild Black Hole from Perturbation Theory to all Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the quantum field theoretic perturbiner approach to Einstein gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.</description>
