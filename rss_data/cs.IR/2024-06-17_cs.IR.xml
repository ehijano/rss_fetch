      <title>A Systematic Review of Generative AI for Teaching and Learning Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in academia is a subjective and hotly debated topic. Currently, there are no agreed guidelines towards the usage of GenAI systems in higher education (HE) and, thus, it is still unclear how to make effective use of the technology for teaching and learning practice. This paper provides an overview of the current state of research on GenAI for teaching and learning in HE. To this end, this study conducted a systematic review of relevant studies indexed by Scopus, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search criteria revealed a total of 625 research papers, of which 355 met the final inclusion criteria. The findings from the review showed the current state and the future trends in documents, citations, document sources/authors, keywords, and co-authorship. The research gaps identified suggest that while some authors have looked at understanding the detection of AI-generated text, it may be beneficial to understand how GenAI can be incorporated into supporting the educational curriculum for assessments, teaching, and learning delivery. Furthermore, there is a need for additional interdisciplinary, multidimensional studies in HE through collaboration. This will strengthen the awareness and understanding of students, tutors, and other stakeholders, which will be instrumental in formulating guidelines, frameworks, and policies for GenAI usage.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Knowledge Retrieval with In-Context Learning and Semantic Search through Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving and extracting knowledge from extensive research documents and large databases presents significant challenges for researchers, students, and professionals in today's information-rich era. Existing retrieval systems, which rely on general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), often fail to provide accurate responses to domain-specific inquiries. Additionally, the high cost of pretraining or fine-tuning LLMs for specific domains limits their widespread adoption. To address these limitations, we propose a novel methodology that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with the fast and accurate retrieval capabilities of vector databases. This advanced retrieval system can efficiently handle both tabular and non-tabular data, understand natural language user queries, and retrieve relevant information without fine-tuning. The developed model, Generative Text Retrieval (GTR), is adaptable to both unstructured and structured data with minor refinement. GTR was evaluated on both manually annotated and public datasets, achieving over 90% accuracy and delivering truthful outputs in 87% of cases. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with a Rouge-L F1 score of 0.98 on the MSMARCO dataset. The refined model, Generative Tabular Text Retrieval (GTR-T), demonstrated its efficiency in large database querying, achieving an Execution Accuracy (EX) of 0.82 and an Exact-Set-Match (EM) accuracy of 0.60 on the Spider dataset, using an open-source LLM. These efforts leverage Generative AI and In-Context Learning to enhance human-text interaction and make advanced AI capabilities more accessible. By integrating robust retrieval systems with powerful LLMs, our approach aims to democratize access to sophisticated AI tools, improving the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of AI-driven information retrieval and database querying.</description>

      <title>IFA: Interaction Fidelity Attention for Entire Lifelong Behaviour Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifelong user behavior sequence provides abundant information of user preference and gains impressive improvement in the recommendation task, however increases computational consumption significantly. To meet the severe latency requirement in online service, a short sub-sequence is sampled based on similarity to the target item. Unfortunately, items not in the sub-sequence are abandoned, leading to serious information loss.
  In this paper, we propose a new efficient paradigm to model the full lifelong sequence, which is named as \textbf{I}nteraction \textbf{F}idelity \textbf{A}ttention (\textbf{IFA}). In IFA, we input all target items in the candidate set into the model at once, and leverage linear transformer to reduce the time complexity of the cross attention between the candidate set and the sequence without any interaction information loss. We also additionally model the relationship of all target items for optimal set generation, and design loss function for better consistency of training and inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by off-line and online experiments in the recommender system of Kuaishou.</description>

      <title>Soil nitrogen forecasting from environmental variables provided by multisensor remote sensing images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a framework for forecasting soil nitrogen content, leveraging multi-modal data, including multi-sensor remote sensing images and advanced machine learning methods. We integrate the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) database, which covers European and UK territory, with environmental variables from satellite sensors to create a dataset of novel features. We further test a broad range of machine learning algorithms, focusing on tree-based models such as CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. We test the proposed methods with a variety of land cover classes, including croplands and grasslands to ensure the robustness of this approach. Our results demonstrate that the CatBoost model surpasses other methods in accuracy. This research advances the field of agricultural management and environmental monitoring and demonstrates the significant potential of integrating multisensor remote sensing data with machine learning for environmental analysis.</description>

      <title>ClimRetrieve: A Benchmarking Dataset for Information Retrieval from Corporate Climate Disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To handle the vast amounts of qualitative data produced in corporate climate communication, stakeholders increasingly rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, a significant gap remains in evaluating domain-specific information retrieval - the basis for answer generation. To address this challenge, this work simulates the typical tasks of a sustainability analyst by examining 30 sustainability reports with 16 detailed climate-related questions. As a result, we obtain a dataset with over 8.5K unique question-source-answer pairs labeled by different levels of relevance. Furthermore, we develop a use case with the dataset to investigate the integration of expert knowledge into information retrieval with embeddings. Although we show that incorporating expert knowledge works, we also outline the critical limitations of embeddings in knowledge-intensive downstream domains like climate change communication.</description>

      <title>Harm Mitigation in Recommender Systems under User Preference Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recommender system that takes into account the interplay between recommendations, the evolution of user interests, and harmful content. We model the impact of recommendations on user behavior, particularly the tendency to consume harmful content. We seek recommendation policies that establish a tradeoff between maximizing click-through rate (CTR) and mitigating harm. We establish conditions under which the user profile dynamics have a stationary point, and propose algorithms for finding an optimal recommendation policy at stationarity. We experiment on a semi-synthetic movie recommendation setting initialized with real data and observe that our policies outperform baselines at simultaneously maximizing CTR and mitigating harm.</description>

      <title>Exploring Traffic Crash Narratives in Jordan Using Text Mining Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores traffic crash narratives in an attempt to inform and enhance effective traffic safety policies using text-mining analytics. Text mining techniques are employed to unravel key themes and trends within the narratives, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to traffic crashes. This study collected crash data from five major freeways in Jordan that cover narratives of 7,587 records from 2018-2022. An unsupervised learning method was adopted to learn the pattern from crash data. Various text mining techniques, such as topic modeling, keyword extraction, and Word Co-Occurrence Network, were also used to reveal the co-occurrence of crash patterns. Results show that text mining analytics is a promising method and underscore the multifactorial nature of traffic crashes, including intertwining human decisions and vehicular conditions. The recurrent themes across all analyses highlight the need for a balanced approach to road safety, merging both proactive and reactive measures. Emphasis on driver education and awareness around animal-related incidents is paramount.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Retrieval For Large Language Model Based Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval is a widely adopted approach for improving language models leveraging external information. As the field moves towards multi-modal large language models, it is important to extend the pure text based methods to incorporate other modalities in retrieval as well for applications across the wide spectrum of machine learning tasks and data types. In this work, we propose multi-modal retrieval with two approaches: kNN-LM and cross-attention techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our retrieval approaches empirically by applying them to automatic speech recognition tasks with access to external information. Under this setting, we show that speech-based multi-modal retrieval outperforms text based retrieval, and yields up to 50 % improvement in word error rate over the multi-modal language model baseline. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art recognition results on the Spoken-Squad question answering dataset.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Text Corpus Exploration with Post Hoc Explanations and Comparative Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text corpus exploration (TCE) spans the range of exploratory search tasks: it goes beyond simple retrieval to include item discovery and learning about the corpus and topic. Systems support TCE with tools such as similarity-based recommendations and embedding-based spatial maps. However, these tools address specific tasks; current systems lack the flexibility to support the range of tasks encountered in practice and the iterative, multiscale, workflows users employ. In this paper, we provide methods that enhance TCE tools with post hoc explanations and multiscale, comparative designs to provide flexible support for user needs. We introduce salience functions as a mechanism to provide post hoc explanations of similarity, recommendations, and spatial placement. This post hoc strategy allows our approach to complement a variety of underlying algorithms; the salience functions provide both exemplar- and feature-based explanations at scales ranging from individual documents through to the entire corpus. These explanations are incorporated into a set of views that operate at multiple scales. The views use design elements that explicitly support comparison to enable flexible integration. Together, these form an approach that provides a flexible toolset that can address a range of tasks. We demonstrate our approach in a prototype system that enables the exploration of corpora of paper abstracts and newspaper archives. Examples illustrate how our approach enables the system to flexibly support a wide range of tasks and workflows that emerge in user scenarios. A user study confirms that researchers are able to use our system to achieve a variety of tasks.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Anomalies in Time: Unsupervised Discovery and Isolation of Anomalous Behavior in Bio-regenerative Life Support System Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of abnormal or critical system states is essential in condition monitoring. While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior. This aspect becomes particularly critical when the monitored system is deployed in a vital environment. In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</description>

      <title>HIRO: Hierarchical Information Retrieval Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face limitations due to static training datasets, resulting in outdated or contextually shallow responses. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating real-time external knowledge, enhancing model accuracy and credibility, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG-enhanced LLMs struggle with long contexts, causing them to "choke" on information overload, compromising response quality. Recent RAG applications use hierarchical data structures for storing documents, organized at various levels of summarization and information density. In this context, we introduce HIRO (Hierarchical Information Retrieval Optimization), a novel querying approach for RAG applications using hierarchical structures for storing documents. HIRO employs DFS-based recursive similarity score calculation and branch pruning to minimize the context returned to the LLM without informational loss. HIRO outperforms existing querying mechanisms on the NarrativeQA dataset by an absolute performance gain of 10.85%.</description>

      <title>On Softmax Direct Preference Optimization for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems aim to predict personalized rankings based on user preference data. With the rise of Language Models (LMs), LM-based recommenders have been widely explored due to their extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning abilities. Most of the LM-based recommenders convert historical interactions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target response and fine-tuning LM with a language modeling loss. However, the current objective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for personalized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of LM-based recommenders. Inspired by the current advancement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax loss in recommendations, we propose Softmax-DPO (S-DPO) to instill ranking information into the LM to help LM-based recommenders distinguish preferred items from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives. Specifically, we incorporate multiple negatives in user preference data and devise an alternative version of DPO loss tailored for LM-based recommenders, connected to softmax sampling strategies. Theoretically, we bridge S-DPO with the softmax loss over negative sampling and find that it has a side effect of mining hard negatives, which assures its exceptional capabilities in recommendation tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of S-DPO to effectively model user preference and further boost recommendation performance while mitigating the data likelihood decline issue of DPO. Our codes are available at https://github.com/chenyuxin1999/S-DPO.</description>

      <title>Towards the TopMost: A Topic Modeling System Toolkit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic models have a rich history with various applications and have recently been reinvigorated by neural topic modeling. However, these numerous topic models adopt totally distinct datasets, implementations, and evaluations. This impedes quick utilization and fair comparisons, and thereby hinders their research progress and applications. To tackle this challenge, we in this paper propose a Topic Modeling System Toolkit (TopMost). Compared to existing toolkits, TopMost stands out by supporting more extensive features. It covers a broader spectrum of topic modeling scenarios with their complete lifecycles, including datasets, preprocessing, models, training, and evaluations. Thanks to its highly cohesive and decoupled modular design, TopMost enables rapid utilization, fair comparisons, and flexible extensions of diverse cutting-edge topic models. Our code, tutorials, and documentation are available at https://github.com/bobxwu/topmost.</description>

Abstract: How easy is it to uniquely identify a person based solely on their web browsing behavior? Here we show that when people navigate the Web, their online traces produce fingerprints that identify them. Merely the four most visited web domains are enough to identify 95% of the individuals. These digital fingerprints are stable and render high re-identifiability. We demonstrate that we can re-identify 80% of the individuals in separate time slices of data. Such a privacy threat persists even with limited information about individuals' browsing behavior, reinforcing existing concerns around online privacy.</description>

Abstract: Examining limitations is a crucial step in the scholarly research reviewing process, revealing aspects where a study might lack decisiveness or require enhancement. This aids readers in considering broader implications for further research. In this article, we present a novel and challenging task of Suggestive Limitation Generation (SLG) for research papers. We compile a dataset called \textbf{\textit{LimGen}}, encompassing 4068 research papers and their associated limitations from the ACL anthology. We investigate several approaches to harness large language models (LLMs) for producing suggestive limitations, by thoroughly examining the related challenges, practical insights, and potential opportunities. Our LimGen dataset and code can be accessed at \url{https://github.com/arbmf/LimGen}.</description>

      <title>A Survey on RAG Meeting LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As one of the most advanced techniques in AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can offer reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, providing huge convenience for numerous tasks. Particularly in the era of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in providing additional knowledge enables RAG to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RA-LLMs) have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in RA-LLMs, covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we systematically review mainstream relevant work by their architectures, training strategies, and application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based recommender models that bridge users and items through textual prompts for effective semantic reasoning have gained considerable attention. However, few methods consider the underlying rationales behind interactions, such as user preferences and item attributes, limiting the reasoning capability of LLMs for recommendations. This paper proposes a rationale distillation recommender (RDRec), a compact model designed to learn rationales generated by a larger language model (LM). By leveraging rationales from reviews related to users and items, RDRec remarkably specifies their profiles for recommendations. Experiments show that RDRec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both top-N and sequential recommendations. Our source code is released at https://github.com/WangXFng/RDRec.</description>
