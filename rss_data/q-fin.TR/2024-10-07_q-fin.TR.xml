      <title>Optimal execution with deterministically time varying liquidity: well posedness and price manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness in the Hadamard sense and the absence of price manipulation in the optimal execution problem within the Almgren-Chriss framework, where the temporary and permanent impact parameters vary deterministically over time. We present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique solution and provide second-order conditions for the problem, with a particular focus on scenarios where impact parameters change monotonically over time. Additionally, we establish conditions to prevent transaction-triggered price manipulation in the optimal solution, i.e. the occurence of buying and selling in the same trading program. Our findings are supported by numerical analyses that explore various regimes in simple parametric settings for the dynamics of impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing in Securities Lending Market: Application in Revenue Optimization for an Agent Lender Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Securities lending is an important part of the financial market structure, where agent lenders help long term institutional investors to lend out their securities to short sellers in exchange for a lending fee. Agent lenders within the market seek to optimize revenue by lending out securities at the highest rate possible. Typically, this rate is set by hard-coded business rules or standard supervised machine learning models. These approaches are often difficult to scale and are not adaptive to changing market conditions. Unlike a traditional stock exchange with a centralized limit order book, the securities lending market is organized similarly to an e-commerce marketplace, where agent lenders and borrowers can transact at any agreed price in a bilateral fashion. This similarity suggests that the use of typical methods for addressing dynamic pricing problems in e-commerce could be effective in the securities lending market. We show that existing contextual bandit frameworks can be successfully utilized in the securities lending market. Using offline evaluation on real historical data, we show that the contextual bandit approach can consistently outperform typical approaches by at least 15% in terms of total revenue generated.</description>
