      <title>Emergence of wind ripples controlled by mechanics of grain-bed impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic sediment patterns have been observed on Earth in riverbeds and sand and snow deserts, but also in other planetary environments. One of the most ubiquitous patterns, familiar wind or 'impact' ripples, adorns sand beaches and arid regions on Earth. The observation of aeolian impact ripples on Mars the same size as their terrestrial counterparts despite a thinner atmosphere raises questions about their formation. Here we show in a numerical simulation that the emergent wavelength of impact ripples is controlled by the mechanics of grain-bed impacts and not the characteristic trajectories of grains above the bed. We find that the distribution of grain trajectories in transport is essentially scale-free, invoking the proximity of a critical point and precluding a transport-related length scale that selects ripple wavelengths. By contrast, when a grain strikes the bed, the process leading to grain ejections introduces a collective granular length scale that determines the scale of the ripples. We propose a theoretical model that predicts a relatively constant ripple size for most planetary conditions. In addition, our model predicts that for high-density atmospheres, such as on Venus, or for sufficiently large sand grains on Earth, impact ripples propagate upwind. Although wind-tunnel and field experiments are needed to confirm the existence of such 'antiripples', we suggest that our quantitative model of wind-blown sediment transport may be used to deduce geological and environmental conditions on other planets from the sizes and propagation speeds of impact ripples.</description>

      <title>Fast Azimuthally Anisotropic 3D Radon Transform by Generalized Fourier Slice Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expensive computation of the conventional sparse Radon transform limits its use for effective transformation of 3D anisotropic seismic data cubes. We introduce a fast algorithm for azimuthally anisotropic 3D Radon transform with sparsity constraints, allowing effective transformation of seismic volumes corresponding to arbitrary anisotropic inhomogeneous media. In particular, a 3D data (CMP) cube of time and offset coordinates is transformed to a 3D cube of intercept time, slowness, and azimuth. The recently proposed generalized Fourier slice theorem is employed for very fast calculation of the 3D inverse transformation and its adjoint, which are subsequently used for efficient implementation of the sparse transform via a forward-backward splitting algorithm. The new anisotropic transform improves the temporal resolution of the resulting seismic data. Furthermore, the Radon transform coefficients allows constructing azimuthally dependent NMO velocity curve at any horizontal plane, which can be inverted for the medium anisotropic parameters. Numerical examples using synthetic data sets are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed anisotropic method in improving seismic processing results compared with conventional isotropic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised surface-related multiple suppression with multidimensional convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-related multiples pose significant challenges in seismic data processing, often obscuring primary reflections and reducing imaging quality. Traditional methods rely on computationally expensive algorithms, the prior knowledge of subsurface model, or accurate wavelet estimation, while supervised learning approaches require clean labels, which are impractical for real data. Thus, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for surface-related multiple suppression, leveraging multi-dimensional convolution to generate multiples from the observed data and a two-stage training strategy comprising a warm-up and an iterative data refinement stage, so the network learns to remove the multiples. The framework eliminates the need for labeled data by iteratively refining predictions using multiples augmented inputs and pseudo-labels. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses surface-related multiples while preserving primary reflections. Migration results confirm its ability to reduce artifacts and improve imaging quality.</description>
