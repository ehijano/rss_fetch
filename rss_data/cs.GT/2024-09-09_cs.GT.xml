      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>

      <title>Adaptation Procedure in Misinformation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interactions between agents in multi-agent systems, in which the agents are misinformed with regards to the game that they play, essentially having a subjective and incorrect understanding of the setting, without being aware of it. For that, we introduce a new game-theoretic concept, called misinformation games, that provides the necessary toolkit to study this situation. Subsequently, we enhance this framework by developing a time-discrete procedure (called the Adaptation Procedure) that captures iterative interactions in the above context. During the Adaptation Procedure, the agents update their information and reassess their behaviour in each step. We demonstrate our ideas through an implementation, which is used to study the efficiency and characteristics of the Adaptation Procedure.</description>

      <title>A new approach to bipartite stable matching optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a common generalization of previously solved optimization problems concerning bipartite stable matchings, we describe a strongly polynomial network flow based algorithm for computing $\ell$ disjoint stable matchings with minimum total cost. The major observation behind the approach is that stable matchings, as edge sets, can be represented as certain cuts of an associated directed graph. This allows us to use results on disjoint cuts directly to answer questions about disjoint stable matchings. We also provide a construction that represents stable matchings as maximum-size antichains in a partially ordered set (poset), which enables us to apply the theorems of Dilworth, Mirsky, Greene and Kleitman directly to stable matchings. Another consequence of these approaches is a min-max formula for the minimum number of stable matchings covering all stable edges.</description>

      <title>Stable Matching with Contingent Priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using school choice as a motivating example, we introduce a stylized model of a many-to-one matching market where the clearinghouse aims to implement contingent priorities, i.e., priorities that depend on the current assignment, to prioritize students with siblings and match them together. We provide a series of guidelines and introduce two natural approaches to implement them: (i) absolute, whereby a prioritized student can displace any student without siblings assigned to the school, and (ii) partial, whereby prioritized students can only displace students that have a less favorable lottery than their priority provider. We study several properties of the corresponding mechanisms, including the existence of a stable assignment under contingent priorities, the complexity of deciding whether there exists one, and its incentive properties. Furthermore, we introduce a soft version of these priorities to guarantee existence, and we provide mathematical programming formulations to find such stable matching or certify that one does not exist. Finally, using data from the Chilean school choice system, we show that our framework can significantly increase the number of students assigned to their top preference and the number of siblings assigned together relative to current practice.</description>

      <title>Fair Allocation of Bandwidth At Edge Servers For Concurrent Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores concurrent FL processes within a three-tier system, with edge servers between edge devices and FL servers. A challenge in this setup is the limited bandwidth from edge devices to edge servers. Thus, allocating the bandwidth efficiently and fairly to support simultaneous FL processes becomes crucial. We propose a game-theoretic approach to model the bandwidth allocation problem and develop distributed and centralized heuristic schemes to find an approximate Nash Equilibrium of the game. We proposed the approach mentioned above using centralized and entirely distributed assumptions. Through rigorous analysis and experimentation, we demonstrate that our schemes efficiently and fairly assign the bandwidth to the FL processes for centralized and distributed solutions and outperform a baseline scheme where each edge server assigns bandwidth proportionally to the FL servers' requests that it receives. The proposed distributed and centralized schemes have comptetive performance.</description>

      <title>Braess's Paradox of Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ChatGPT has established Generative AI (GenAI) as a significant technological advancement. However, GenAI's intricate relationship with competing platforms and its downstream impact on users remains under-explored. This paper initiates the study of GenAI's long-term social impact resulting from the weakening network effect of human-based platforms like Stack Overflow. First, we study GenAI's revenue-maximization optimization problem. We develop an approximately optimal solution and show that the optimal solution has a non-cyclic structure. Then, we analyze the social impact, showing that GenAI could be socially harmful. Specifically, we present an analog to Braess's paradox in which all users would be better off without GenAI. Finally, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for a regulator with incomplete information to ensure that GenAI is socially beneficial.</description>

      <title>The Value of Ambiguous Commitments in Multi-Follower Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study games in which a leader makes a single commitment, and then multiple followers (each with a different utility function) respond. In particular, we study ambiguous commitment strategies in these games, in which the leader may commit to a set of mixed strategies, and ambiguity-averse followers respond to maximize their worst-case utility over the set of leader strategies. Special cases of this setting have previously been studied when there is a single follower: in these cases, it is known that the leader can increase her utility by making an ambiguous commitment if the follower is restricted to playing a pure strategy, but that no gain can be had from ambiguity if the follower may mix. We confirm that this result continues to hold in the setting of general Stackelberg games. We then develop a theory of ambiguous commitment in games with multiple followers. We begin by considering the case where the leader must make the same commitment against each follower. We establish that -- unlike the case of a single follower -- ambiguous commitment can improve the leader's utility by an unboundedly large factor, even when followers are permitted to respond with mixed strategies and even. We go on to show an advantage for the leader coupling the same commitment across all followers, even when she has the ability to make a separate commitment to each follower. In particular, there exist general sum games in which the leader can enjoy an unboundedly large advantage by coupling her ambiguous commitment across multiple followers rather than committing against each individually. In zero-sum games we show there can be no such coupling advantage. Finally, we give a polynomial time algorithm for computing the optimal leader commitment strategy in the special case in which the leader has 2 actions (and k followers may have m actions), and prove that in the general case, the problem is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic and uncertain societal-scale systems. In these systems, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often acting without any information about other agents. The design and analysis of decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remain elusive, especially beyond Markov zero-sum games and Markov potential games, which do not adequately capture the nature of many real-world interactions that is neither fully competitive nor fully cooperative. This paper investigates the design of decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide provable guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria in the long run. Our approach builds on constructing a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) to address the intractability of designing algorithms that converge to exact Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that MNPFs play a central role in ensuring the convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning algorithm to approximate Nash equilibria. By leveraging a two-timescale approach, where Q-function estimates are updated faster than policy updates, we show that the system converges to a level set of the MNPF over the set of approximate Nash equilibria. This convergence result is further strengthened if the set of Nash equilibria is assumed to be finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis and design of decentralized learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Agreement in the Arrovian Framework</title>

Abstract: Preference aggregation is a fundamental problem in voting theory, in which public input rankings of a set of alternatives (called preferences) must be aggregated into a single preference that satisfies certain soundness properties. The celebrated Arrow Impossibility Theorem is equivalent to a distributed task in a synchronous fault-free system that satisfies properties such as respecting unanimous preferences, maintaining independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), and non-dictatorship, along with consensus since only one preference can be decided.
  In this work, we study a weaker distributed task in which crash faults are introduced, IIA is not required, and the consensus property is relaxed to either $k$-set agreement or $\epsilon$-approximate agreement using any metric on the set of preferences. In particular, we prove several novel impossibility results for both of these tasks in both synchronous and asynchronous distributed systems. We additionally show that the impossibility for our $\epsilon$-approximate agreement task using the Kendall tau or Spearman footrule metrics holds under extremely weak assumptions.</description>

      <title>Maximization of Communication Network Throughput using Dynamic Traffic Allocation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing network throughput in real-world dynamic systems is critical, especially for diverse and delay-sensitive multimedia data types such as VoIP and video streaming. Traditional routing protocols, which rely on static metrics and single shortest-path algorithms, were unable in managing this complex information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances resource utilization while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS). Our dynamic traffic allocation model prioritizes different data types based on their delay sensitivity and allocates traffic by considering factors such as bandwidth, latency, and network failures. This approach is shown to significantly improve network throughput compared to static load balancing, especially for multimedia applications. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of this dynamic method in maximizing network throughput and maintaining QoS across various data types.</description>

      <title>Quantum Volunteer's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volunteer's dilemma is a well-known game in game theory that models the conflict players face when deciding whether to volunteer for a collective benefit, knowing that volunteering incurs a personal cost. In this work, we introduce a quantum variant of the classical volunteer's dilemma, generalizing it by allowing players to utilize quantum strategies. Employing the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantization framework, we analyze a multiplayer quantum volunteer's dilemma scenario with an arbitrary number of players, where the cost of volunteering is shared equally among the volunteers. We derive analytical expressions for the players' expected payoffs and demonstrate the quantum game's advantage over the classical game. In particular, we prove that the quantum volunteer's dilemma possesses symmetric Nash equilibria with larger expected payoffs compared to the unique symmetric Nash equilibrium of the classical game, wherein players use mixed strategies. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Nash equilibria we identify are Pareto optimal. Our findings reveal distinct dynamics in volunteer's dilemma scenarios when players adhere to quantum rules, underscoring a strategic advantage of decision-making in quantum settings.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Persuasion with Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a game of persuasion with evidence, a sender has private information. By presenting evidence on the information, the sender wishes to persuade a receiver to take a single action (e.g., hire a job candidate, or convict a defendant). The sender's utility depends solely on whether or not the receiver takes the action. The receiver's utility depends on both the action and the sender's private information. We study three natural variations. First, we consider the problem of computing an equilibrium of the game without commitment power. Second, we consider a persuasion variant, where the sender commits to a signaling scheme and the receiver, after seeing the evidence, takes the action or not. Third, we study a delegation variant, where the receiver first commits to taking the action if being presented certain evidence, and the sender presents evidence to maximize the probability the action is taken. We study these variants through the computational lens, and give hardness results, optimal approximation algorithms, and polynomial-time algorithms for special cases. Among our results is an approximation algorithm that rounds a semidefinite program that might be of independent interest, since, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first such approximation algorithm in algorithmic economics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Structure and Polynomial-time Algorithm of Game Equilibriums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether a PTAS (polynomial-time approximation scheme) exists for game equilibriums has been an open question, and the absence of this polynomial-time algorithm has indications and consequences in three fields, such as the practicality of methods in algorithmic game theory, non-stationarity and curse of multiagency in MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning), and the tractability of PPAD in computational complexity theory. In this paper, we introduce a geometric object called equilibrium bundle, which leads to a fundamental leap in the understanding of game equilibriums. Regarding the equilibrium bundle, first, we formalize perfect equilibriums of dynamic games as the zero points of its canonical section, second, we formalize a hybrid iteration of dynamic programming and interior point method as a line search on it, such that the method is an FPTAS (fully PTAS) for any perfect equilibrium of any dynamic game, implying PPAD=FP, third, we give the existence and oddness theorems of it as an extension of those of Nash equilibriums. As intermediate results, we introduce a concept called policy cone to give the sufficient and necessary condition for dynamic programming to converge to perfect equilibriums, and introduce two concepts called unbiased barrier problem and unbiased KKT conditions to make the interior point method to approximate Nash equilibriums. In experiment, the line search process is animated, and the method is tested on 2000 randomly generated dynamic games where it converges to a perfect equilibrium in every single case.</description>

      <title>On the Distortion of Committee Election with 1-Euclidean Preferences and Few Distance Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider committee election of $k \geq 2$ (out of $m \geq k+1$) candidates, where the voters and the candidates are associated with locations on the real line. Each voter's cardinal preferences over candidates correspond to her distance to the candidate locations, and each voter's cardinal preferences over committees is defined as her distance to the nearest candidate elected in the committee. We consider a setting where the true distances and the locations are unknown. We can nevertheless have access to degraded information which consists of an order of candidates for each voter. We investigate the best possible distortion (a worst-case performance criterion) wrt. the social cost achieved by deterministic committee election rules based on ordinal preferences submitted by $n$ voters and few additional distance queries. For $k = 2$, we achieve bounded distortion without any distance queries; we show that the distortion is $3$ for $m = 3$, and that the best possible distortion achieved by deterministic algorithms is at least $n-1$ and at most $n+1$, for any $m \geq 4$. For any $k \geq 3$, we show that the best possible distortion of any deterministic algorithm that uses at most $k-3$ distance queries cannot be bounded by any function of $n$, $m$ and $k$. We present deterministic algorithms for $k$-committee election with distortion of $O(n)$ with $O(k)$ distance queries and $O(1)$ with $O(k \log n)$ distance queries.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Counterfactual Regret Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization is a family of algorithms of no-regret learning dynamics capable of solving large-scale imperfect information games. We propose implementing this algorithm as a series of dense and sparse matrix and vector operations, thereby making it highly parallelizable for a graphical processing unit, at a cost of higher memory usages. Our experiments show that our implementation performs up to about 352.5 times faster than OpenSpiel's Python implementation and up to about 22.2 times faster than OpenSpiel's C++ implementation and the speedup becomes more pronounced as the size of the game being solved grows.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Misalignment Between Agents: Towards a Sociotechnical Understanding of Alignment</title>

Abstract: Existing work on the alignment problem has focused mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a monolith. Recent sociotechnical approaches highlight the need to understand complex misalignment among multiple human and AI agents. We address this gap by adapting a computational social science model of human contention to the alignment problem. Our model quantifies misalignment in large, diverse agent groups with potentially conflicting goals across various problem areas. Misalignment scores in our framework depend on the observed agent population, the domain in question, and conflict between agents' weighted preferences. Through simulations, we demonstrate how our model captures intuitive aspects of misalignment across different scenarios. We then apply our model to two case studies, including an autonomous vehicle setting, showcasing its practical utility. Our approach offers enhanced explanatory power for complex sociotechnical environments and could inform the design of more aligned AI systems in real-world applications.</description>
