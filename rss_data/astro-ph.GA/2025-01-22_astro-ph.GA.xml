      <title>Connection between steep radio spectral slopes and dust extinction in QSOs: evidence for outflow-driven shocks in dusty QSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have found a striking positive correlation between the amount of dust obscuration and enhanced radio emission in quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). However, what causes this connection remains unclear. In this paper we analyse uGMRT Band-3 (400 MHz) and Band-4 (650 MHz) data of a sample of 38 $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$ QSOs with existing high-resolution $0.2''$ e-MERLIN 1.4 GHz imaging. In combination with archival radio data, we have constructed sensitive 4-5 band radio SEDs across 0.144-3 GHz to further characterize the radio emission in dusty QSOs. We find that the dusty QSOs (those with E(B-V) $&gt; 0.1$ mag) are more likely to exhibit steep spectral slopes ($\alpha &lt; -0.5$; $S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) than the non-dusty QSOs (E(B-V) $&lt; 0.1$ mag), with fractions of 46$\pm$12 and 12$\pm$4 per cent, respectively. A higher fraction of the non-dusty QSOs have peaked radio SEDs (48$\pm$9 per cent) compared to the dusty QSOs (23$\pm$8 per cent). We discuss the origin of the radio emission, finding that the majority of the peaked, predominantly non-dusty, QSOs have consistent sizes and luminosities with compact jetted radio galaxies. However, the connection between steepness and dust obscuration implies an outflow-driven shock origin for the enhanced radio more commonly found in dusty QSOs. These results add to the emerging picture whereby dusty QSOs are in an earlier blow-out phase, with shocks that heat and destroy the surrounding dust, eventually revealing a typical non-dusty QSO.</description>

      <title>MAGIS (Measuring Abundances of red super Giants with Infrared Spectroscopy) project I. Establishment of an abundance analysis procedure for red supergiants and its evaluation with nearby stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abbreviated] Context. Given their high luminosities (L&gt;~10^4Lsun), red supergiants (RSGs) are good tracers of the chemical abundances of the young stellar population in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. However, previous abundance analyses tailored to RSGs suffer some systematic uncertainties originating in, most notably, the synthesized molecular spectral lines for RSGs. Aims. We establish a new abundance analysis procedure for RSGs that circumvents difficulties faced in previous works, and test the procedure with ten nearby RSGs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph WINERED (0.97--1.32 micron, R=28,000). Results. We determined the [X/Fe] of ten elements (Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, K I, Ca I, Ti I, Cr I, Ni I, and Y II). We estimated the relative precision in the derived abundances to be 0.04--0.12 dex for elements with more than two lines analyzed (e.g., Fe I and Mg I) and up to 0.18 dex for the other elements (e.g., Y II). We compared the resultant abundances of RSGs with the well-established abundances of another type of young star, namely the Cepheids, in order to evaluate the potential systematic bias in our abundance measurements, assuming that the young stars (i.e., both RSGs and Cepheids) in the solar neighborhood have common chemical abundances. We find that the determined RSG abundances are highly consistent with those of Cepheids within &lt;~0.1 dex for some elements (notably [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]), which means the bias in the abundance determination for these elements is likely to be small. In contrast, the consistency is worse for some other elements (e.g., [Si/Fe] and [Y/Fe]). Nevertheless, the dispersion of the chemical abundances among our target RSGs is comparable with the individual statistical errors on the abundances. Hence, the procedure is likely to be useful to evaluate the relative difference in chemical abundances among RSGs.</description>

      <title>REBELS-IFU: Dust Build-up in Massive Galaxies at Redshift 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond $z\gtrsim6$. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve $6.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.7$ galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average $\log(\mathrm{DtG}) = -3.02 \pm 0.23$, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average $\log(\mathrm{DtS}) = -2.15 \pm 0.42$ is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at $z\approx7$ likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.</description>

      <title>PAH Feature Ratios Around Stellar Clusters and Associations in 19 Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison of observed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature ratios in 19 nearby galaxies with a grid of theoretical expectations for near- and mid-infrared dust emission. The PAH feature ratios are drawn from Cycle 1 JWST observations and are measured for 7224 stellar clusters and 29176 stellar associations for which we have robust ages and mass estimates from HST five-band photometry. Though there are galaxy-to-galaxy variations, the observed PAH feature ratios largely agree with the theoretical models, particularly those that are skewed toward more ionized and larger PAH size distributions. For each galaxy we also extract PAH feature ratios for 200 pc-wide circular regions in the diffuse interstellar medium, which serve as a non-cluster/association control sample. Compared to what we find for stellar clusters and associations, the 3.3um/7.7um and 3.3um/11.3um ratios from the diffuse interstellar medium are $\sim 0.10-0.15$ dex smaller. When the observed PAH feature ratios are compared to the radiation field hardness as probed by the [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio, we find anti-correlations for nearly all galaxies in the sample. These results together suggest that the PAH feature ratios are driven by the shape intensity of the radiation field, and that the smallest PAHs -- observed via JWST F335M imaging -- are increasingly 'processed' or destroyed in regions with the most intense and hard radiation fields.</description>

      <title>REBELS-IFU: Dust attenuation curves of 12 massive galaxies at $z\simeq7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the dust attenuation curves of 12 massive ($9~&lt;~\log$($M_{\star}/{M}_{\odot})$ $&lt;~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$ derived from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. The galaxies are drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) large program. The dust attenuation curves were obtained by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models with a flexible dust law to the full galaxy spectra over observed wavelengths $0.6-5.3$ $\mu$m. These attenuation curves show a range of recovered slopes ($-0.39\leq\delta\leq0.08$) that are on average slightly flatter than seen in local sources of the same stellar masses, with none exhibiting very steep slopes. Three galaxies exhibit evidence for a 2175 \r{A} dust bump ($&gt;4\sigma$) and we find SED fitting excluding the bump can overestimate derived stellar masses by up to $0.4$ dex. Correcting for the dust attenuation with our best-fit attenuation curves we recover a range of intrinsic UV-slopes ($-2.5\leq\beta_0\leq-2.2$). The galaxies show moderate reddening ($A_V~=~0.1-0.6$ mag) and the $A_V$ to stellar mass relation is consistent with local sources. The attenuation law slope is found to correlate with $A_V$, while we see no strong correlation with stellar mass, ${M_{\rm UV}}$, or gas-phase metallicity. Overall, our results show little evolution in dust properties in the REBELS sources compared to the local Universe. Comparing our recovered trends to empirical models suggests that the most important factor driving the variation in the attenuation curves in our sample is the dust-star geometry, not the properties of the dust grains themselves.</description>

      <title>REBELS-IFU: Evidence for metal-rich massive galaxies at z~6-8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallicity is a crucial tracer of galaxy evolution, providing insights into gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. At high redshift, these processes reveal how early galaxies assembled and enriched their interstellar medium. In this work, we present rest-frame optical spectroscopy of 12 massive ($\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})&gt;9$) galaxies at $z\sim 6$-$8$ from the REBELS ALMA large program, observed with JWST NIRSpec/IFU in the prism mode. These observations span emission lines from [OII]$\lambda$3727,9 to [SII]$\lambda$6716,31, providing key information on nebular dust attenuation, ionisation states, and chemical abundances. We find lower O32 ratios (average $\sim3.7$) and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 equivalent widths (average ${EW_{[OIII]}}\sim390$\AA) than are generally found in existing large spectroscopic surveys at $z&gt;6$, indicating less extreme ionising conditions. Strong-line diagnostics suggest that these systems are some of the most metal-rich galaxies observed at $z&gt;6$ (average $Z_{\mathrm{gas}}\sim 0.4 Z_{\odot}$), including sources with near-solar oxygen abundances, in line with their high stellar masses (average $\log{M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}}\sim9.5$). Supplementing with literature sources at lower masses, we investigate the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations (MZR and FMR, respectively) over a 4 dex stellar mass range at $6&lt;z&lt;8$. In contrast to recent studies of lower-mass galaxies, we find no evidence for negative offsets to the $z=0$ FMR for the REBELS galaxies. This work demonstrates the existence of chemically-enriched galaxies just $\sim1$ Gyr after the Big Bang, and indicates that the MZR is already in place at these early times, in agreement with other recent $z&gt;3$ studies.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: kNN identification of perturbed galaxies through HI morphometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology in stellar light can be described by a series of "non-parametric" or "morphometric" parameters, such as concentration-asymmetry-smoothness, Gini, $M_{20}$, and Sersic fit. These parameters can be applied to column density maps of atomic hydrogen (HI). The HI distribution is susceptible to perturbations by environmental effects, e.g. inter-galactic medium pressure and tidal interactions. Therefore, HI morphology can potentially identify galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping or tidal interactions. We explore three fields in the WALLABY Pilot HI survey and identify perturbed galaxies based on a k-nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm using an HI morphometric feature space. For training, we used labeled galaxies in the combined NGC 4808 and NGC 4636 fields with six HI morphometrics to train and test a kNN classifier. The kNN classification is proficient in classifying perturbed galaxies with all metrics -- accuracy, precision and recall -- at 70-80%. By using the kNN method to identify perturbed galaxies in the deployment field, the NGC 5044 mosaic, we find that in most regards, the scaling relations of perturbed and unperturbed galaxies have similar distribution in the scaling relations of stellar mass vs star formation rate and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, but the HI and stellar mass relation flatter than of the unperturbed galaxies. Our results for NGC 5044 provide a prediction for future studies on the fraction of galaxies undergoing interaction in this catalogue and to build a training sample to classify such galaxies in the full WALLABY survey.</description>

      <title>A Large Systematic Search for Close Supermassive Binary and Rapidly Recoiling Black Holes -- IV. Ultraviolet spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet (UV) of 13 quasars at z&lt;0.7, along with contemporaneous optical spectra from ground-based telescopes. The targets were selected to have broad H-beta emission lines with substantial velocity offsets relative to the rest frame of their host galaxy. By analogy to single-line spectroscopic binary stars, these objects have been regarded as supermassive black hole binary (SBHB) candidates where the offset emission lines may be caused by bulk orbital motion. The best alternative explanation is that the H-beta line profile is the result of non-axisymmetric emission from a disk-like broad-line region associated with a single supermassive black hole. We use the broad UV line profiles to discriminate between these two scenarios. We describe our methodology for isolating the broad optical and UV line profiles and the criteria we apply for comparing them. Of the 13 SBHB candidates, three have strong evidence in support of the SBHB hypothesis, five have tentative support, one is disfavored, and four have such severely absorbed UV line profiles that the results are inconclusive.</description>

      <title>A pioneering experiment combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data to measure Faraday rotation with GMIMS and the CGPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structures in the magneto-ionic medium exist across a wide range of angular sizes due to large-scale magnetic fields coherent over the Galactic spiral arms combined with small-scale fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density resulting from energy injection processes such as supernovae. For the first time, we produce diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission Faraday rotation maps covering all spatial scales down to $3'$ resolution for Galactic magnetic field studies. These maps complement standard total and polarized intensity maps combining single-antenna and interferometric data that have been produced, for example, for the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). Such combined maps have sensitivity to large scales from the single-antenna component, and the resolution from the interferometric component. We combine Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey High-Band-North (GMIMS-HBN) single-antenna and CGPS aperture-synthesis polarization data after spatial filtering, producing Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps individually for the four CGPS frequency channels. We calculate Rotation Measures (RM) for all pixels using a linear fit to polarization angle versus wavelength squared. The RM maps show magnetic field structures on the full range of scales probed by this dataset. Regions of smooth polarized emission require the large-scale sensitivity of the single-antenna data to illuminate the Faraday depths, while the aperture-synthesis data reveal small-scale variability in the Faraday rotation. Despite the limitation of the 35 MHz bandwidth of the CGPS, we demonstrate that useful information on Faraday rotation structures can be obtained by combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data, highlighting the important synergy between future broadband interferometric and single-antenna polarization surveys.</description>

      <title>An Unexplained Origin for the Unusual Globular Cluster System in the Ultra-diffuse Galaxy FCC 224</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quiescent ultra-diffuse galaxy FCC 224 in the Fornax cluster using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, motivated by peculiar properties of its globular cluster (GC) system revealed in shallower imaging. The surface brightness fluctuation distance of FCC 224 measured from HST is $18.6 \pm 2.7$ Mpc, consistent with the Fornax Cluster distance. We use Prospector to infer the stellar population from a combination of multi-wavelength photometry (HST, ground-based, WISE) and Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy. The galaxy has a mass-weighted age of $\sim$ 10 Gyr, metallicity [M/H] of $\sim -1.25$ dex, and a very short formation $e$-folding time of $\tau \sim 0.3$ Gyr. Its 12 candidate GCs exhibit highly homogeneous $g_{\rm 475}-I_{\rm 814}$ colors, merely 0.04 mag bluer than the diffuse starlight, which supports a single burst formation scenario for this galaxy. We confirm a top-heavy GC luminosity function, similar to the two dark matter deficient galaxies NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4. However, FCC 224 differs from those galaxies with relatively small GC sizes of $\sim$ 3 pc ($\sim 35\%$ smaller than typical for other dwarfs), and with radial mass segregation in its GC system. We are not yet able to identify a formation scenario to explain all of the GC properties in FCC 224. Follow-up measurements of the dark matter content in FCC 224 will be crucial because of the mix of similarities and differences among FCC 224, DF2, and DF4.</description>

      <title>The outer gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal structures are a common feature in a wide variety of astrophysical objects, including dusty tori in AGNs, rings in galaxies, protoplanetary disks, and others. The matter distribution in such structures is not homogeneous and can be flattened by self-gravity or become elongated in the vertical direction, as is the case with obscuring tori in AGNs. This led us to consider the more general case of the gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. We begin by showing that the outer potential of a homogeneous elliptical torus can be effectively approximated with less than 1\% error by the potentials of two infinitely thin rings with a minor correction term. These two rings have masses each equal to half the total mass of the torus. The most notable feature is that each such infinitely thin ring is positioned at precisely the halfway point between the center and the focus of the elliptical cross-section, regardless of the torus' other parameters. The result, which holds for both oblate and prolate geometries, allows us to find a new expression to handle the outer potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. The confocal density distribution is a special case. We have found that the outer potential of such a torus is only weakly dependent of the density distribution law. Consequently, even for the confocal inhomogeneous case, the outer potential is well represented by two infinitely thin rings. This approach can simplify problems of dynamics for the systems consisting of toroidal structures. We have also derived the expressions for the external force components exerted by a homogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section, both for the exact form of the potential and for our approximation by two infinitely thin rings. Comparison of the two shows that our model fits the true trend of the force well.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution of Active Galactic Nuclei: Implications for Cosmological Simulations of Galaxy Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a very important role in constraining modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here, we utilize an advanced supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk model to compute the accretion flow structure and AGN SED across a wide range of black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) and dimensionless accretion rates $\dot{m}(\equiv \dot{M}_{\rm acc}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd})$, where $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is the mass flow rate through the disk and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$ is the Eddington mass accretion rate. We find that the radiative efficiency is mainly influenced by $\dot m$, while contributions of $M_{\rm SMBH}$ and $\dot{m}$ to the bolometric luminosity are comparably important. We have developed new scaling relationships that relate the bolometric luminosity of an AGN to its luminosities in the hard X-ray, soft X-ray, and optical bands. Our results align with existing literature at high luminosities but suggest lower luminosities in the hard and soft X-ray bands for AGNs with low bolometric luminosities than commonly reported values. Combining with the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation \textsc{L-Galaxies} and Millennium dark matter simulation for the distribution of ($M_{\rm SMBH}, \dot{m}$) at different redshift, we find the model predictions align well with observational data at redshifts below 1 but deviates for higher redshifts regarding AGN detection fraction and luminosity functions. This deviation may arise from improper treatment of SMBH growth at high redshifts in the model or bias from limited observational data. This AGN SED calculation can be readily applied in other cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation II: Stellar Mass Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new color-$\Upsilon_*$ (mass-to-light) models to convert WISE W1 fluxes into stellar masses. We outline a range of possible star formation histories and chemical evolution scenarios to explore the confidence limits of stellar population models on the value of $\Upsilon_*$. We conclude that the greatest uncertainties (around 0.1 dex in $\Upsilon_*$) occur for the bluest galaxies with the strongest variation in recent star formation. For high mass galaxies, the greatest uncertainty arises from the proper treatment of bulge/disk separation in which to apply different $\Upsilon_*$ relations appropriate for those differing underlying stellar populations. We compare our deduced stellar masses with those deduced from {\it Spitzer} 3.6$\mu$m fluxes and stellar mass estimates in the literature using optical photometry and different $\Upsilon_*$ modeling. We find the correspondence to be excellent, arguing that rest-frame near-IR photometry is still more advantageous than other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \simeq 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal core: A 5D Analysis for a 6D Methodology with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Gaia DR3 data, we examine the kinematics of the central core of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data which includes proper motions and line-of-sight velocities for member stars in addition to their projected positions. We extract a sample of bright stars that are high-probability members of Sgr. We model the distances to these stars, which is the only missing phase-space component measurement from our 5D sample, highlighting how their corresponding uncertainties propagate to affect the kinematics. Using line-of-sight velocity data only, which are not affected by the distance uncertainties, and assuming a jeans-based equilibrium analysis, we obtain a velocity anisotropy of $\beta_a = -2.24 \pm 1.99$, which implies a system with tangentially-biased orbits. With the full 5D data, we project that the data will significantly improve upon measurements of the log-slope of the dark matter density profile and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Tests with mock distance data show an improvement of anisotropy errors of approximately an order of magnitude, and log slope at the half light radius of approximately half an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The evolution of metallicity gradients in galaxies from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracing the cosmic path of galaxies requires an understanding of their chemical enrichment and merging histories. One of the most important constraints is the internal structure of galaxies, notably the internal distribution of elements acting as fossils in extra-galactic archaeology. Using our cosmological chemodynamical simulations, which include all relevant physical processes and the latest nucleosynthesis yields, we investigate the evolution of radial metallicity gradients of stellar populations and the interstellar medium within each galaxy. This work explores the role of supernova feedback on the metallicity gradients by comparing three feedback models, ejecting energy in thermal, stochastic and mechanical forms. At $z=0$, the mechanical feedback model produces the gradient--mass relations of stars and gas both in excellent agreement with observations; gradients are the steepest at intermediate-mass ($M_*\sim10^{10}M_\odot$) and become flatter in massive galaxies probably by major mergers. For each model, we predict similar gradient--mass relations up to $z=4$ and find that the mechanical feedback model gives flatter gradients of both stars and gas for lower-mass galaxies ($M_*&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) possibly due to the suppression of star formation and metal ejection by stellar feedback. With all feedback models, most galaxies have negative gas-phase metallicity gradients up to $z=5$, suggesting an inside-out growth, which is consistent with other cosmological simulations but not with recent observations at $z\sim1$--2.5. We find a mild redshift evolution of gradients up to $z=4$, while there seems to be an evolutionary transition at $z=5$ where the metallicity gradients become steep for gas and stars.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: Quantifying the AGN component of X-ray-detected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the deepest X-ray survey from the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) `7-Ms' survey with the deepest mid-infrared (5.6$ \mu m$) image from the JWST/MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) to study the infrared counterparts and point-source emission of 31 X-ray sources with a median, intrinsic, rest-frame X-ray luminosity of $\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}^{\rm 0.5-7keV})$=42.04$\pm$0.22 erg $\rm s^{-1}$. The sample includes 24 AGN with a redshift range, as set by the X-ray detectability, of $z \simeq 0.5-3$. Through a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition, employing three separate classifications (visual, parametric and non-parametric) we separate (where present) the luminosity of the point-like AGN component from the remainder of the host-galaxy emission. The unprecedented mid-infrared sensitivity and imaging resolution of MIRI allows, in many cases, the direct characterisation of point-like (i.e. unresolved) components in the galaxies' emission. We establish a broad agreement between the three morphological classifications. At least 70% of the X-ray sources, including some classified as galaxies, show unresolved emission in the MIRI images, with the unresolved-to-total flux fraction at rest-frame 2$\mu m$ ranging from $\sim$0.2 to $\sim$0.9. At high X-ray luminosities ($\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}$)&gt;43 erg $\rm s^{-1}$) we derive a consistent rest-frame near-infrared 2$ \mu m$ point-source luminosity to that derived for local AGN, whilst at lower X-ray luminosity we identify an excess in the 2$ \mu m$ emission compared to pre-JWST studies. We speculate this offset may be driven by a combination of Compton-thick AGN components and nuclear starburst, merger driven activity. Our observations highlight the complex nature of X-ray sources in the distant Universe and demonstrate the power of JWST/MIRI in quantifying their nuclear infrared emission. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Comparison of Herschel and ArT\'eMiS observations of massive filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: OMC-3 in the Orion A Cloud is a nearby, high-mass star-forming region, and therefore ideal to study massive filaments in detail. Aims: We analyze how the inclusion of higher-resolution data changes the estimates of the filament properties and test the robustness of filament fitting routines. Methods. ArT\'eMiS and Herschel data are combined to create high-resolution images. Column densities and temperatures are estimated with modified blackbody fitting. The nearby OMC-3 cloud is compared to the more distant G202 and G17 clouds. We compare the OMC-3 cloud as it appears at Herschel and ArT\'eMiS resolution. Results. Column densities of dense clumps in OMC-3 are higher in combined ArT\'eMiS and Herschel data (FWHM 8.5"), when compared to Herschel-only data (FWHM 20"). Estimated filament widths are smaller in the combined maps, and also show signs of further fragmentation when observed with the ArT\'eMiS resolution. In the analysis of Herschel data the estimated filament widths are correlated with the distance of the field. Conclusions. Median filament FWHM in OMC-3 at higher resolution is 0.05 pc, but 0.1 pc with the Herschel resolution, 0.3 pc in G202 and 1.0 pc in G17, also at the Herschel resolution. It is unclear what causes the steep relation between distance and filament FWHM, but likely reasons include the effect of the limited telescope resolution combined with existing hierarchical structure, and convolution of large-scale background structures within the ISM. Estimates of the asymptotic power-law index of the filament profile function p is high. When fit with the Plummer function, the individual parameters of the profile function are degenerate, while the FWHM is better constrained. OMC-3 shows negative kurtosis, and all but OMC-3 at the Herschel resolution some asymmetry.</description>

      <title>The JCMT Gould Belt Survey: First results from the Corona Australis molecular cloud and evidence of variable dust emissivity indices in the Coronet region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 450$\mu$m and 850$\mu$m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations of the Corona Australis (CrA) molecular cloud taken as part of the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS). We present a catalogue of 39 starless and protostellar sources, for which we determine source temperatures and masses using SCUBA-2 450$\mu$m/850$\mu$m flux density ratios for sources with reliable 450$\mu$m detections, and compare these to values determined using temperatures measured by the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS). In keeping with previous studies, we find that SCUBA-2 preferentially detects high-volume-density starless cores, which are most likely to be prestellar (gravitationally bound). We do not observe any anti-correlation between temperature and volume density in the starless cores in our sample. Finally, we combine our SCUBA-2 and Herschel data to perform SED fitting from 160-850$\mu$m across the central Coronet region, thereby measuring dust temperature $T$, dust emissivity index $\beta$ and column density $N({\rm H}_2)$ across the Coronet. We find that $\beta$ varies across the Coronet, particularly measuring $\beta = 1.55 \pm 0.35$ in the colder starless SMM-6 clump to the north of the B star R CrA. This relatively low value of $\beta$ is suggestive of the presence of large dust grains in SMM-6, even when considering the effects of $T-\beta$ fitting degeneracy and $^{12}$CO contamination of SCUBA-2 850$\mu$m data on the measured $\beta$ values.</description>

      <title>B-fields And dust in interstelLar fiLAments using Dust POLarization (BALLAD-POL): III. Grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in G34.43+0.24 using polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission due to aligned non-spherical grains helps us to trace magnetic field (B-field) morphology in molecular clouds and to study grain alignment mechanisms. In this work, we study grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in a filamentary infrared dark cloud G34.43+0.24 using thermal dust polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu\text{m}$. We study in three sub-regions as North harboring MM3 core, Center harboring MM1 and MM2 cores and South having no core. We find the decrease in polarization fraction P with increasing total intensity and gas column density, known as polarization hole. To disentangle the effect of magnetic field tangling on the polarization hole, we estimate the polarization angle dispersion function. We find depolarizations in North and Center regions are due to decrease in net alignment efficiency of grains but in South region, effect of magnetic field tangling is significant to cause depolarization. To test whether RAdiative Torque (RAT) mechanism can reproduce the observational data, we calculate minimum alignment and disruption sizes of grains using RAT theory and our study finds that RAT alignment mechanism can explain the depolarizations in North and Center regions where B-field tangling effect is less important, except for core regions. We find hints of RAdiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) in the core regions of MM3 in North, MM1 and MM2 in Center. We also find that the high P value of around 8-20% in the outer regions of the filament can be explained potentially by magnetically enhanced RAT alignment mechanism.</description>

      <title>Classification of HI Galaxy Profiles Using Unsupervised Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis and Methodological Cases of Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is crucial for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. The 21 cm neutral atomic hydrogen - HI spectral line maps the gas kinematics within galaxies, providing key insights into interactions, galactic structure, and star formation processes. With new radio instruments, the volume and complexity of data is increasing. To analyze and classify integrated HI spectral profiles in a efficient way, this work presents a framework that integrates Machine Learning techniques, combining unsupervised methods and CNNs. To this end, we apply our framework to a selected subsample of 318 spectral HI profiles of the CIG and 30.780 profiles from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey catalogue. Data pre-processing involved the Busyfit package and iterative fitting with polynomial, Gaussian, and double-Lorentzian models. Clustering methods, including K-means, spectral clustering, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering, were used for feature extraction and to bootstrap classification we applied K-NN, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers, optimizing accuracy with CNN. Additionally, we introduced a 2D model of the profiles to enhance classification by adding dimensionality to the data. Three 2D models were generated based on transformations and normalised versions to quantify the level of asymmetry. These methods were tested in a previous analytical classification study conducted by the Analysis of the Interstellar Medium in Isolated Galaxies group. This approach enhances classification accuracy and aims to establish a methodology that could be applied to data analysis in future surveys conducted with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), currently under construction.

      <title>Less Wound and More Asymmetric: JWST Confirms the Evolution of Spiral Structure in Galaxies at $z \lesssim 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe. However the properties of spiral arms in them are still not well studied, and there is even less information concerning spiral structure in distant galaxies. We aim to measure the most general parameters of spiral arms in remote galaxies and trace their changes with redshift. We perform photometric decomposition, including spiral arms, for 159 galaxies from the HST COSMOS and JWST CEERS and JADES surveys, which are imaged in optical and near-infrared rest-frame wavelengths. We confirm that, in our representative sample of spiral galaxies, the pitch angles increase, and the azimuthal lengths decrease with increasing redshift, implying that the spiral structure becomes more tightly wound over time. For the spiral-to-total luminosity ratio and the spiral width-to-disc scale length ratio, we find that band-shifting effects can be as significant as, or even stronger than, evolutionary effects. Additionally, we find that spiral structure becomes more asymmetric at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Tracing the galaxy-halo connection with galaxy clustering in COSMOS-Web from z = 0.1 to z ~ 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 12$ using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at $z \ge 10$ and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at $z \ge 2.5$ best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &gt; 10.5 with $\log(M_\star / M_\odot) \ge 8.85$ are hosted by halos with $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) $M_\star / (f_b M_{\rm h}) $ up to 1 dex higher than at $z \le 1$. The high galaxy bias at $z \ge 8$ suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at $z \ge 10.5$, decreasing until $z \sim 2 - 3$, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-$z$ galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that $z &gt; 8$ galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At $z \sim 2 - 3$ and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE: An ultra-faint $\simeq$ 10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ Pop III Galaxy Candidate and First Constraints on the Pop III UV Luminosity Function at $z\simeq6-7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $z\sim6-13$ intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At $z\gtrsim9$ the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions $\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23}$ ($&gt;0.70$ excluding GNz11) at $z \approx 6.5, 9.3$. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density $\log_{10}N_\mathrm{HI}\approx10^{20.8}$ cm$^{-2}$, comparable to $z\sim3$ Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Active Galactic Nucleus Effects on the Stellar and Gas Properties of NGC 5806</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a strong impact upon the evolution of their host galaxies, but the processes by which they do so are not fully understood. We aim to further the understanding of AGN feeding and feedback by examining an active galaxy using spatially-resolved spectroscopy. We analyze integral field spectroscopy of the active galaxy NGC 5806, obtained using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We map the dynamics of gas and stars, as well as gas optical emission line fluxes throughout the central 8 x 8 kpc$^2$ of the galaxy. We use emission line ratios to map gas metallicity and identify regions of gas excitation dominated by AGN/shocks or star formation. We also determine the average stellar population age and metallicity, and model the rotation and dynamics of the galaxy. We find that NGC 5806 has a star-forming circumnuclear ring, with a projected radius of about 400 pc. The dynamics of this galaxy are driven by a large-scale bar, which transports gas from the spiral arm to the central ring and potentially fuels the AGN. We also observe AGN-dominated gas excitation up to 3.3 kpc away from the center of the galaxy, showing the extended AGN effect on the gas in the central regions of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Direct N-body simulations of NGC 6397 and its tidal tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a series of direct N-body simulations that study the evolution of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397 under the combined influence of two-body relaxation, stellar evolution and the Milky Way's tidal field. Our simulations follow the evolution of the cluster over the last several Gyr up to its present-day position in the Milky Way in order to allow us to derive present-day cluster parameters and the distribution of its extra-tidal stars. We have also determined a new density profile of NGC 6397 by selecting stars from Gaia DR3 using Gaia DR3 proper motions, parallaxes and photometry to discriminate cluster members from non-members. This allows us to derive the surface density profile of NGC 6397 and the location of its tidal tails up to 10 degrees of the cluster centre, well beyond the tidal radius of NGC 6397. Our results show that the current state of NGC 6397 in terms of surface density, velocity dispersion profile and stellar mass function can be matched by a cluster model evolving from a standard initial mass function and does not require an additional central cluster of dark remnants. We also find good agreement in the location and absolute number of the extra-tidal stars between our simulations and the observations, making it unlikely that NGC 6397 is surrounded by a dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Examining Turbulence in Galactic Molecular Clouds -- I: A Statistical Analysis of Velocity Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of 167 molecular clouds with angular sizes greater than $\sim$176 arcmin$^2$ in three sectors of the Galactic mid-plane. We calculated the 1st- to 3rd-order VSFs and found that 60\% of the VSFs exhibit power-law distributions. The relative power-law exponents are consistent with predictions from intermittent turbulence models. Column density weighting reduces the proportion of power-law VSFs and steepens the VSF slopes, implying a reduction of turbulent energy in high-density regions. All clouds show small-scale intermittency, with slightly stronger intermittency in those molecular clouds showing none power-law VSFs. Negative VSF exponents that may indicate gravitational collapse are not observed in our sample. The scaling exponents of the observed VSFs do not correlate with the virial parameters of the molecular clouds. These two observations suggest that gravity-dominated scales in molecular clouds still need further investigation. Consistent VSF scaling exponents for the molecular clouds with significant power-law VSFs suggest large-scale external driving of turbulence in these molecular clouds. However, the driving mechanisms are likely not universal, as the power-law scaling coefficients in our results show relatively large scatter. The fact that nearly 40\% of the VSFs deviate to some extent from power-law distributions suggests that the influence of local environments on the internal turbulence of molecular clouds may not be negligible.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Scatter Originating from Sub-kiloparsec Starbursting Clumps in the Core of a Protocluster at z=7.88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) G395H/F290LP observations of a merging galaxy system at $z=7.88$, part of A2744-z7p9, the most distant protocluster to date. The IFU cube reveals [OIII] emissions in two previously known galaxies (ZD3 and ZD6) and a newly identified galaxy, ZD12, at $z_{\rm spec}=7.8762$. One of the detected \oiii-emitting regions has a detection of the auroral [OIII]4363, line, allowing us to derive a direct metallicity of $\log$(O/H)$+12=7.4\pm0.2$, while metallicities in other regions are measured using strong line calibration methods. We find large deviations within the measured metallicity ($\Delta \log {\rm (O/H)}\sim1$), which suggests a fast chemical enrichment from intense star formation and merger-driven growth, as expected in early galaxies. Our analysis shows that metal-poor regions could easily be outshone by more enriched regions, posing a challenge for spectroscopic analysis based on integrated light (i.e., NIRSpec MSA) against identifying metal-free star formation in the early universe. NIRCam imaging reveals seven UV-bright clumps in ZD12, in the range of stellar mass $\log M_*/M_\odot\sim7.6$--8.9. Four of them are unresolved ($&lt; 100$pc) and intensely star-forming ($&gt;30 M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}}$), likely contributing to the scatter in metallicity by producing an ideal environment for rapid chemical cycles. Lastly, we revisit the nature of the host protocluster by including new member galaxies identified here and in the literature, and obtain local overdensity factor $\delta=44_{-31}^{+89}$, total halo mass $M_{\rm h} = 5.8_{-0.3}^{+0.2}\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$, and a formal velocity dispersion of $1100\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Considerations with stacking absorption spectra: cold HI gas in cirrus region of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Milky Way neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption and emission spectra from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (GASKAP) Phase II Pilot survey along with toy models to investigate the effects of stacking multicomponent spectra on measurements of peak optical depth and spin temperature. Shifting spectra by the peak in emission, 'primary' components shifted to 0 km s$^{-1}$ are correctly averaged. Additional components on individual sightlines are averaged with non-centred velocities, producing a broader and shallower 'secondary' component in the resulting stack. Peak optical depths and brightness temperatures of the secondary components from stacks are lower limits of their true average values due to the velocity offset of each component. The spin temperature however is well correlated with the truth since the velocity offset of components affects the emission and absorption spectra equally. Stacking 462 GASKAP absorption-emission spectral pairs, we detect a component with a spin temperature of 1320 $\pm$ 263 K, consistent with gas from the unstable neutral medium and higher than any previous GASKAP detection in this region. We also stack 2240 pilot survey spectra containing no Milky Way absorption, revealing a primary narrow and secondary broad component, with spin temperatures belonging to the cold neutral medium (CNM). Spatially binning and stacking the non-detections across the plane-of-sky by their distance from CNM absorption detections, the primary component's optical depth decreases with distance from known locations of cold gas. The spin temperature however remains stable in both components, over an approximate physical plane-of-sky distance of $\sim$ 100 pc.</description>

      <title>The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon: A challenge for galaxy evolution models and dust radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon ($z\approx2$). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has so far not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation. Methods. We apply the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors are then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass ($M_\star\lesssim10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by $\approx0.9\,\mathrm{mag}$. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below $\sim1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Modelling of Polarized Dust Emission in Intermediate-Mass YSOs: II: Effects of Radiative Torque Disruption on Dust Grains in Protostellar Jets/Outflows</title>

Abstract: One of the potential explanations for the existence of very large grains (VLGs) in the inner envelope of low/intermediate-mass Class 0/I Young Stellar Object is the migration of VLGs from the protostellar disk via a protostellar outflow. To understand whether the grain migration is prevented by RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), we perform the numerical modeling of RATD in parallel with the grain propagation, using the gas velocity and density structure inside the jet and outflow from an MHD simulation of an intermediate Class 0 protostar. We found that with the bolometric luminosity $\geq 20L_{\odot}$, RATD can destroy aggregate grains of size $1 \sim 500\rm \mu m$ having maximum tensile strength $S_{\rm max} \leq 10^{5} \rm erg cm^{-3}$ inside the jet/outflow base after $&lt; 2$ yrs. This effect lets sub-micron grains dominate the outflow and partially prevent the migration of large grains from the inner disk to inner envelope. In contrast, RATD cannot prevent the migration of composite VLGs and submillimeter grains having $S_{\rm max}\geq 10^{7} \rm erg cm^{-3}$. Next, we incorporate RATD into POLARIS, assuming grains are not moving relative to the gas. We found that POLARIS works well in describing the disruption for aggregate grains, but overestimates the disruption efficiency for composite grains. The observed polarization degree can be reduced by twice when aggregate grains are removed from the outflow cavity wall and inner envelope by RATD. However, RATD is not an important factor controlling dust polarization properties as iron inclusions do.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) form in massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^5\,M_\odot$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates become comparable to their accretion rates ($\gtrsim10^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation ($\sim 1-2\,{\rm Myr}$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars ($\lesssim1\,{\rm M}_\odot$) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small ($\Delta Y \simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs, that may leave behind black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap ($\gtrsim120\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and that the nitrogen-rich galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are in the first phase of galaxy evolution, when a large fraction of star formation occurs in the form of GCs.</description>

      <title>Cold gas bubble inflated by a low-luminosity radio jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NOEMA CO(2-1) observations of a nearby, young, low-luminosity radio source, B2 0258+35. Our earlier CO(1-0) study had shown the presence of strong jet-ISM interaction and a massive molecular gas outflow involving 75$\%$ of the circumnuclear gas. Our follow-up CO(2-1) observations have revealed even more complex gas kinematics, where the southern radio jet is driving out molecular gas in the form of a swiftly expanding bubble, with velocities up to almost 400 km s$^{-1}$. We found highly elevated CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratios for the gas belonging to the bubble and also further away from the radio jets. Previous observations have shown that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the host galaxy, NGC 1167, is in a very low-accretion state. Thus, we attribute the high line ratios to the high gas excitation caused by the jet--ISM interaction. The radio jets, despite exhibiting a relatively low luminosity ($1.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), are solely responsible for the observed extreme gas kinematics. This is one of the clearest detections of an expanding cold gas bubble in such a type of source, showing that the jets are affecting both the kinematics and physicals conditions of the gas. Our study adds to the growing store of evidence that low-luminosity radio sources can also affect the kinematics and physical conditions of the cold gas, which fuels star formation, in their host galaxies to a significant extent. Hence, such sources should be considered in models seeking to quantify feedback from radio AGN.</description>

      <title>On the nature of buckling instability in galactic bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many strong simulated galactic bars experience buckling instability, which manifests itself as a vertical distortion out of the disk plane which later dissipates. Using a simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy I demonstrate that the phenomenon can be divided into two distinct phases. In the first one, the distortion grows and its pattern speed remains equal to the pattern speed of the bar so that the distortion remains stationary in the reference frame of the bar. The growth can be described simply with the mechanism of a driven harmonic oscillator which decreases the vertical frequencies of the stars. At the end of this phase most bar-supporting orbits have banana-like shapes with resonant vertical-to-horizontal frequency ratio close to two. The increase of amplitudes of vertical oscillations leads to the decrease of the amplitudes of horizontal oscillations and the shrinking of the bar. The mass redistribution causes the harmonic oscillators to respond adiabatically and increase the horizontal frequencies. In the following, second phase of buckling, the pattern speed of the distortion increases reaching one third of the circular frequency, but decreases with radius. The distortion propagates as a kinematic bending wave and winds up leaving behind a pronounced boxy/peanut shape. The increased horizontal frequencies cause the weakening of the bar and the transformation of banana-like orbits into pretzel-like ones, except in the outer part of the bar where the banana-like orbits and the distortion survive. The results strongly suggest that the buckling of galactic bars is not related to the fire-hose instability but can be fully explained by the mechanism of vertical resonance creating the distortion that later winds up.</description>

      <title>Effect of gas accretion on $\alpha$-element bimodality in Milky Way-mass galaxies in the FIRE-2 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the stellar distributions on the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane for 11 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations. Alpha-element bimodality, in the form of two separate sequences on the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane, is not a universal feature of disk galaxies. Five galaxies demonstrate double sequences with the $\alpha$-enriched one being older and kinematically hotter, in qualitative agreement with the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ populations in the Milky Way disk; three galaxies have unimodal distribution, two show weakly-bimodal features where low-$\alpha$ sequence is visible only over a short range of metallicities, and one show strong bimodality with a different slope of high-$\alpha$ population. We examine the galaxies' gas accretion history over the last 8 Gyr, when bimodal sequences emerge, and demonstrate that the presence of the low-$\alpha$ sequence in the bimodal galaxies is related to the recent infall of metal-poor gas from the circumgalactic medium that joins the galaxy in the outskirts and induces significant growth of the gas disks compared to their non-bimodal counterparts. We also analyse the sources of the accreted gas and illustrate that both gas-rich mergers and smooth accretion of ambient gas can be the source of the accreted gas, and create slightly different bimodal patterns.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Inferring Accretion Signatures in Young Stellar Objects: A Case Study with VIRUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to understanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even how planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion rates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph ($R \sim 800$, 3500-5500\r{A}) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly releasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which can also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code fits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each VIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between model parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach self-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a thorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not accomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates of each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to results separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to results from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions. Finally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were found among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful improvement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs observed by VIRUS or other spectrographs.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Jet/Outflow Shocks Heating the Environment Around the Class I Protostellar Source Elias 29: FAUST XXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have observed the late Class I protostellar source Elias~29 at a spatial-resolution of 70~au with the Atacama~Large~Millimeter/submillimeter~Array (ALMA) as part of the FAUST Large Program. We focus on the line emission of SO, while that of $^{34}$SO, C$^{18}$O, CS, SiO, H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, and DCO$^{+}$ are used supplementally. The spatial distribution of the SO rotational temperature ($T_{\rm rot}$(SO)) is evaluated by using the intensity ratio of its two rotational excitation lines. Besides in the vicinity of the protostar, two hot spots are found at a distance of 500 au from the protostar; $T_{\rm rot}$(SO) locally rises to 53$^{+25}_{-15}$~K at the interaction point of the outflow and the southern ridge, and 72$^{+66}_{-29}$~K within the southeastern outflow probably due to a jet-driven bow shock. However, the SiO emission is not detected at these hot spots. It is likely that active gas accretion through the disk-like structure and onto the protostar still continues even at this evolved protostellar stage, at least sporadically, considering the outflow/jet activities and the possible infall motion previously reported. Interestingly, $T_{\rm rot}$(SO) is as high as 20$-$30~K even within the quiescent part of the southern ridge apart from the protostar by 500$-$1000~au without clear kinematic indication of current outflow/jet interactions. Such a warm condition is also supported by the low deuterium fractionation ratio of HCO$^+$ estimated by using the H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and DCO$^{+}$ lines. The B-type star HD147889 $\sim$0.5 pc away from Elias~29, previously suggested as a heating source for this region, is likely responsible for the warm condition of Elias~29.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. III. Astrophysical implications of second-order and dotriacontapole terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-term evolution of selected hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity. We employ analytic equations derived in Paper II for the evolution of orbit-averaged orbital elements for both inner and outer orbits, which include two classes of contributions. One class consists of linear-order contributions, including quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole and dotriacontapole orders, the latter scaling as $\epsilon^6$, where $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. The second class consists of contributions at {\em second} order in the fundamental perturbation parameter; they contribute at orders $\epsilon^{9/2}$, $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$ and $\epsilon^{6}$. For well studied triples such as star-planet systems perturbed by a low-mass third body (``hot Jupiters''), second-order and dotriacontapole (SOD) effects induce only small corrections. For stellar-mass binaries orbiting supermassive black holes, SOD corrections can suppress orbital flips that are generated by purely first-order effects. Planets orbiting binary star systems are susceptible to significant variations in the planetary semimajor axis, an effect that does not occur at first perturbative order. SOD effects in triple black hole systems can induce migrations of the eccentricity to significantly larger values than predicted by first-order perturbations, with implications for the gravitational-wave induced inspiral of the inner binary. We also show that in most cases, evolutions using our SOD equations are in better agreement with those from direct integration of the N-body equations of motion than those from first-order perturbations through hexadecapole order.</description>

      <title>Where in the Milky Way Do Exoplanets Preferentially Form?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets are detected around stars of different ages and birthplaces within the Galaxy. The aim of this work is to infer the Galactic birth radii ($r_\text{birth}$) of stars and, consequently, their planets, with the ultimate goal of studying the Galactic aspects of exoplanet formation. We used photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric data to estimate the stellar ages of two samples of stars hosting planets and, for comparison, a sample of stars without detected planets. The $r_\text{birth}$ of exoplanets were inferred by projecting stars back to their birth positions based on their estimated age and metallicity [Fe/H]. We find that stars hosting planets have higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ compared to stars without detected planets. In particular, stars hosting high-mass planets show higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ than stars hosting low-mass planets. We show that the formation efficiency of planets, calculated as the relative frequency of planetary systems, decreases with the galactocentric distance, which relationship is stronger for high-mass planets than for low-mass planets. Additionally, we find that (i) the formation efficiency of high-mass planets increases with time and encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; (ii) the formation efficiency of low-mass planets shows a slight increase between the ages of 4 and 8 Gyr and also encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; and (iii) stars without detected planets appear to form at larger galactocentric distances over time. We conclude that the formation of exoplanets throughout the Galaxy follows the Galactic chemical evolution, for which our results are in agreement with the observed negative interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient and its enrichment and flattening with time at any radius.</description>

      <title>Rising Stargirls: Benefits of a Creative Arts-Based Approach to Astronomy Education for Middle-School Girls from Underrepresented Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Women from historically marginalized groups in the sciences continue to be severely underrepresented in the fields of physics and astronomy. Young girls identifying with these groups often lose interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields well before college. Middle school (grades 6-8) emerges as a pivotal phase for nurturing science identities among girls. The educational program Rising Stargirls offers creative arts-based astronomy workshops for middle-school girls, with the aim of cultivating their science identities. We retrospectively analyze participants' responses to four key assessment items through which their engagement in science and their science identities before and after the workshops are assessed. Our findings overwhelmingly indicate that girls exhibit heightened engagement in science and enhanced science identities after engaging in the Rising Stargirls program. These outcomes underscore the merits of fostering creativity and integrating the arts into science education.</description>

      <title>The TW Hydrae Association is a cluster chain of Sco-Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TW Hydrae Association (TWA) is a young local association (YLA) about 50 pc from the Sun, offering a unique opportunity to study star and planet formation processes in detail. We characterized TWA's location, kinematics, and age, investigating its origin within the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric data and precise ground-based radial velocities, we identified substructures within TWA, tentatively dividing them into TWA-a and TWA-b. Sco-Cen's massive cluster $\sigma$ Cen (15 Myr, 1,805 members) may have influenced TWA's formation. The alignment of $\sigma$ Cen, TWA-a, and TWA-b in 3D positions, velocities, and ages resembles patterns in regions such as Corona Australis, suggesting that TWA is part of a cluster chain from sequential star formation induced by massive stars in Sco-Cen. TWA's elongation in the opposite direction to that produced by Galactic differential rotation indicates its shape is still influenced by its formation processes and will dissipate in less than 50 Myr due to Galactic forces. These findings unveil the nature of YLAs and low-mass clusters in a new light. We propose that clusters such as $\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis, $\eta$ Chamaeleontis, and TWA were forged by stellar feedback from massive stars in Sco-Cen, while others--such as $\beta$ Pictoris, Carina, Columba, and Tucana-Horologium--are older and formed differently. Remarkably, all these YLAs and Sco-Cen are part of the $\alpha$ Persei cluster family, a vast kiloparsec-scale star formation event active over the past 60 Myr. This suggests that YLAs are the smallest stellar structures emerging from major star formation episodes and should be common in the Milky Way. Crucially, their formation in regions with intense stellar feedback may have influenced planet formation in these systems.</description>

Abstract: A method based on Generative Adversaria! Networks (GANs) is developed for disentangling the physical (effective temperature and gravity) and chemical (metallicity, overabundance of a-elements with respect to iron) atmospheric properties in astronomical spectra. Using a projection of the stellar spectra, commonly called latent space, in which the contribution dueto one or several main stellar physicochemical properties is minimised while others are enhanced, it was possible to maximise the information related to certain properties, which can then be extracted using artificial neural networks (ANN) as regressors with higher accuracy than a reference method based on the use of ANN trained with the original spectra. Methods. Our model utilises autoencoders, comprising two artificial neural networks: an encoder anda decoder which transform input data into a low-dimensional representation known as latent space. It also uses discriminators, which are additional neural networks aimed at transforming the traditional autoencoder training into an adversaria! approach, to disentangle or reinforce the astrophysical parameters from the latent space. The GANDALF tool is described. It was developed to define, train, and test our GAN model with a web framework to show how the disentangling algorithm works visually. It is open to the community in Github. Results. The performance of our approach for retrieving atmospheric stellar properties from spectra is demonstrated using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrograph (RVS) data from DR3. We use a data-driven perspective and obtain very competitive values, ali within the literature errors, and with the advantage of an important dimensionality reduction of the data to be processed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced imaging of M87*: Simulations with the EHT and extended-KVN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has successfully revealed the shadow of the supermassive black hole, M87*, with an unprecedented angular resolution of approximately 20 uas at 230 GHz. However, because of limited short baseline lengths, the EHT has been constrained in its ability to recover larger scale jet structures. The extended Korean VLBI Network (eKVN) is committed to joining the EHT from 2024 that can improve short baseline coverage. This study evaluates the impact of the participation of eKVN in the EHT on the recovery of the M87* jet. Synthetic data, derived from a simulated M87* model, were observed using both the EHT and the combined EHT+eKVN arrays, followed by image reconstructions from both configurations. The results indicate that the inclusion of eKVN significantly improves the recovery of jet structures by reducing residual noise. Furthermore, jackknife tests, in which one or two EHT telescopes were omitted - simulating potential data loss due to poor weather - demonstrate that eKVN effectively compensates for these missing telescopes, particularly in short baseline coverage. Multi-frequency synthesis imaging at 86-230 GHz shows that the EHT+eKVN array enhances the recovered spectral index distribution compared to the EHT alone and improves image reconstruction at each frequency over single-frequency imaging. As the EHT continues to expand its array configuration and observing capabilities to probe black hole physics more in depth, the integration of eKVN into the EHT will significantly enhance the stability of observational results and improve image fidelity. This advancement will be particularly valuable for future regular monitoring observations, where consistent data quality is essential.</description>

      <title>PyEMILI: A New Generation Computer-aided Spectral Line Identifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep high-dispersion spectroscopy of Galactic photoionized gaseous nebulae, mainly planetary nebulae and HII regions, has revealed numerous emission lines. As a key step of spectral analysis, identification of emission lines hitherto has mostly been done manually, which is a tedious task, given that each line needs to be carefully checked against huge volumes of atomic transition/spectroscopic database to reach a reliable assignment of identity. Using Python, we have developed a line-identification code PyEMILI, which is a significant improvement over the Fortran-based package EMILI introduced ~20 years ago. In our new code PyEMILI, the major shortcomings in EMILI's line-identification technique have been amended. Moreover, the atomic transition database utilized by PyEMILI was adopted from Atomic Line List v3.00b4 but greatly supplemented with theoretical transition data from the literature. The effective recombination coefficients of the CII, OII, NII and NeII nebular lines are collected from the literature to form a subset of the atomic transition database to aid identification of faint optical recombination lines in the spectra of PNe and HII regions. PyEMILI is tested using the deep, high-dispersion spectra of two Galactic PNe, Hf2-2 and IC418, and gives better results of line identification than EMILI does. We also ran PyEMILI on the optical spectrum of a late-type [WC11] star UVQS J060819.93-715737.4 recently discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and our results agree well with the previous manual identifications. The new identifier PyEMILI is applicable to not only emission-line nebulae but also emission stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.</description>

      <title>Prospects for high-resolution probes of galaxy dynamics tracing background cosmology in MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-$N$ galaxy surveys offer unprecedented opportunities to probe weak gravitation in galaxy dynamics that may contain correlations tracing background cosmology. Of particular interest is the potential of finite sensitivities to the background de Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $c$ is the velocity of light. At sufficiently large $N$, this is possibly probed by ensemble-averaged ("stacked") rotation curves (RCs) at resolutions on par with present estimates of the Hubble parameter $H_0$. Here, we consider the prospect for studies using the large $N$ Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) at APO survey. In a first and preliminary step, we consider unbiased control of sub-sample size by consistency in the three Position Angles, $\theta$ , from photometry and velocity fields of gas and stars by spectroscopy within $30^\circ$. In sub-samples of size $N=N_i(\theta)$, the scatter in-the-mean $\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ is found to reach one percent levels, differentiated over inclination angle $i$ and $\theta$. In regular propagation of uncertainties, this scatter contributes $\kappa\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ to the standard error in-the-mean to the observable, where $\kappa$ is determined by the choice of observables. As a lower bound to scatter in stacked RCs, MaNGA hereby appears promising for high-resolution analysis of sensitivity to RCs to background cosmology, notably across a sharp $C^0$-transition (van Putten 2018) of Newtonian to anomalous dynamics across $a_{dS}$ and, further out, the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. In turn, these markers provide a novel measurement of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigating launching of black hole jets with the combined power of the EVN and the EHT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AGN-launched jets are a crucial element in the study of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their closest surroundings. The formation of such jets, whether they are launched by magnetic field lines anchored to the accretion disc or directly connected to the black hole's (BH) ergosphere, is the subject of ongoing, extensive research. 3C84, the compact radio source in the central galaxy NGC1275 of the Perseus super-cluster, is a prime laboratory for testing such jet launching scenarios, as well as studying the innermost, sub-parsec AGN structure and jet origin. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers a unique view into the physical processes in action, in the immediate vicinity of BHs, unparalleled by other observational techniques. With VLBI at short wavelengths particular high angular resolutions are obtained. Utilising such cm and mm-VLBI observations of 3C84 with the European VLBI Network and the Event Horizon Telescope, we study the magnetic field strength and associated accretion flow around its central SMBH. This is possible, as higher frequency VLBI measurements are capable of peering through the accretion flow surrounding the central engine of 3C84, which is known to block the line of sight to the sub-parsec counter-jet via free-free absorption. Furthermore, we study the magnetic field's signature in the core region, as manifested in polarised light. As part of this analysis we compare our observations to relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we investigate the effect of instabilities on the shape of the jet's parsec-scale funnel and try to connect them to its historical evolution.</description>

Abstract: The article provides a brief description of the software package DECH for processing and analysis of astronomical spectra. DECH supports all stages of processing and analysis of spectral data, including image preprocessing, spectra extraction (including those with a variable tilted slit), wavelength calibration by a two-dimensional polynomial, continuum normalization (manual or automatic), measurement of equivalent widths and radial velocities in various ways, cross-correlation analysis, etc. The DECH software package is actively used by astronomers from different countries and continues to be improved. In particular, utilities for processing and analysis of data from the high-resolution fiber-feed echelle spectrograph installed at 6-m telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory of Russian Academy of Sciences were added in the latest version. Software provides high-precision measurements of radial velocities, including those for detection of extraterrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Molecular Envelope of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first interferometric imaging of molecular line emission from the Ring Nebula, NGC~6720, in the form of Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO $J=2\rightarrow 1$ emission. The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) mapping data, with $\sim$3$''$ spatial resolution and 2 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring's clumpy molecular envelope. The morphology of the velocity-integrated SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) image closely resembles those of near-IR H$_2$ and PAH emission in JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC~6720, with the molecular gas forming a geometrically thin layer surrounding the ionized gas imaged by HST and JWST. A simple, geometrical model of the $^{12}$CO(2--1) data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC~6720's molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is $\sim$6000 yr. The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) data furthermore reveal that filamentary features seen projected in the Ring's interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of $\pm$45--50 km s$^{-1}$ relative to systemic, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring's molecular envelope was formed via a relatively sudden, AGB-terminating mass ejection event $\sim$6000 yr ago, and that this ellipsoidal envelope was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most molecule-rich, ``Ring-like'' planetary nebulae.</description>

      <title>Mapping Dark Matter in the Milky Way using Normalizing Flows and Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel, data-driven analysis of Galactic dynamics, using unsupervised machine learning -- in the form of density estimation with normalizing flows -- to learn the underlying phase space distribution of 6 million nearby stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Solving the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation, we calculate -- for the first time ever -- a model-free, unbinned estimate of the local acceleration and mass density fields within a 3 kpc sphere around the Sun. As our approach makes no assumptions about symmetries, we can test for signs of disequilibrium in our results. We find our results are consistent with equilibrium at the 10% level, limited by the current precision of the normalizing flows. After subtracting the known contribution of stars and gas from the calculated mass density, we find clear evidence for dark matter throughout the analyzed volume. Assuming spherical symmetry and averaging mass density measurements, we find a local dark matter density of $0.47\pm 0.05$ GeV/cm$^3$. We compute the dark matter density at four radii in the stellar halo and fit to a generalized NFW profile. Although the uncertainties are large, we find a profile broadly consistent with recent analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarimetry of stars at optical and near-infrared wavelengths is an invaluable tool for tracing interstellar dust and magnetic fields. Recent studies have demonstrated the power of combining stellar polarimetry with distances from the Gaia mission, in order to gain accurate, three-dimensional information on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field and the dust distribution. However, access to optical polarization data is limited, as observations are conducted by different investigators, with different instruments and are made available in many separate publications. To enable a more widespread accessibility of optical polarimetry for studies of the interstellar medium, we compile a new catalog of stellar polarization measurements. The data are gathered from 81 separate publications spanning two decades since the previous, widely-used agglomeration of catalogs by Heiles (2000). The compilation contains a total of 55,742 measurements of stellar polarization. We combine this database with stellar distances based on the Gaia Early Data Release 3, thereby providing polarization and distance data for 42,482 unique stars. We provide three separate data products: an Extended Polarization Catalog (containing all polarization measurements), a Source Catalog (with distances and stellar identifications) and a Unique Source Polarization and Distance catalog (containing a subset of sources excluding duplicate measurements). We propose the use of a common tabular format for the publication of stellar polarization catalogs to facilitate accessibility and increase discoverability in the future.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Faint, Red AGN at $z&gt;4$: A Sample of Little Red Dots in the JWST Extragalactic Legacy Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of 341 "little red dots" (LRDs) spanning the redshift range $z\sim2-11$ using data from the CEERS, PRIMER, JADES, UNCOVER and NGDEEP surveys. Unlike past use of color indices to identify LRDs, we employ continuum slope fitting using shifting bandpasses to sample the same rest-frame emission blueward and redward of the Balmer break. This enables the detection of LRDs over a wider redshift range and with less contamination from galaxies with strong breaks that otherwise lack a rising red continuum. The redshift distribution of our sample increases at $z&lt;8$ and then undergoes a rapid decline at $z\sim4.5$, which may tie the emergence of these sources to the inside-out growth that galaxies experience during this epoch. We find that LRDs are $\sim1$ dex more numerous than X-ray and UV selected AGN at z~5-7. Within our sample, we have identified the first two X-ray detected LRDs. An X-ray spectral analysis confirms that these AGN are moderately obscured with $\log\,(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{2}$) of $23.3^{+0.4}_{-1.3}$ and $22.72^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$. Our analysis reveals that reddened AGN emission dominates their rest-optical light, while the rest-UV originates from their host galaxies. We also present NIRSpec observations from the RUBIES survey of 17 LRDs that show broad emission lines consistent with AGN activity. The confirmed AGN fraction of our sample is 71\% for sources with F444W&lt;26.5. In addition, we find three LRDs with blue-shifted Balmer absorption features in their spectra, suggesting an outflow of high-density, low-ionization gas from near the central engine of these faint, red AGN.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Ionizing Photon Contributions of High-Redshift Galaxies to Reionization with JWST NIRCam Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is providing constraints on the history of reionization owing to its ability to detect faint galaxies at $z\gg6$. Modeling this history requires understanding both the ionizing photon production rate ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium ($f_{\rm esc}$). Observational estimates of these quantities generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions are limited. To overcome this challenge, we present and release an implicit likelihood inference pipeline, PHOTONIOn, trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies ($\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. We show that PHOTONIOn is able to reliably infer $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ from photometry. This is in contrast to traditional SED-fitting approaches which rely on $f_{\rm esc}$ prescriptions that often over-predict $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ for LyC-dim galaxies, even when given access to spectroscopic data. We have deployed PHOTONIOn on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding gentle redshift evolutions of $\log_{10}(\dot{N}_{\rm ion}) = (0.08\pm0.01)z + (51.60\pm0.06)$ and $\log_{10}(f_{\rm esc}\xi_{\rm ion}) = (0.07\pm0.01)z + (24.12\pm0.07)$. Late-time values for the ionizing photon production rate density are consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the IGM ionized fraction to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization in GOODS-S to completion by $z\sim 5.3$ without the need for AGN or other exotic sources, consistent with other studies of the same field. The $20\%$ of UV-brightest galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5$) reionize $35\%$ of the survey volume, demonstrating that UV faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.</description>

      <title>A Dusty Dawn: Galactic Dust Buildup at $z\gtrsim5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array has revealed massive, dusty star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim5$, and the James Webb Space Telescope is primed to uncover even more information about them. These observations need dust evolution theory to provide context and are excellent benchmarks to test this theory. Here, we investigate the evolution of galactic dust budget at cosmic dawn using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of moderately massive, high-redshift ($M_{\rm star}\gtrsim10^9 M_{\odot}$; $z\gtrsim5$) galaxies from the FIRE project, the highest resolution ($m_{\rm b} \approx 7100\, M_{\odot}$) of such simulations to date. Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species, allowing it to replicate a wide range of present-day observations. We find, similar to other theoretical works, that dust growth via gas-dust accretion is the dominant producer of dust mass for these massive, $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. However, our fiducial model produces $M_{\rm dust}$ that fall ${\gtrsim}1$ dex below observations at any given $M_{\rm star}$ (typical uncertainties are ${\sim}1$ dex), which we attribute to reduced accretion efficiencies caused by a combination of low galactic metallicities and extremely bursty star formation. Modest enhancements (i.e., within observational/theoretical uncertainties) to accretion and SNe II dust creation raise $M_{\rm dust}$ by ${\lesssim}1$ dex, but this still falls below observations which assume $T_{\rm dust}\sim25$ K. One possibility is that inferred dust masses for $z\gtrsim4$ galaxies are overestimated, and recent observational/analytical works that find $T_{\rm dust}\sim50$ K along with metallicity constraints tentatively support this.</description>

      <title>Two Channels of Metal-Rich Compact Stellar System Formation: Starbursts under High Ram Pressure vs. Tidal Stripping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most galaxies follow well-defined scaling relations of metallicity and stellar mass; however, some outliers at the low mass end of the observed galaxy population exhibit unusually high metallicity for their mass. Understanding how these objects get to be so metal-rich is vital for understanding the role of feedback in galaxy formation. Using the TNG50 simulation, we explore the origins of this phenomenon. We identify 227 metal-rich, Compact Stellar Systems (CSSs) that deviate significantly from this scaling relation. These CSSs are satellites located in the vicinity of massive host galaxies, with stellar masses ranging from $10^{8} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ (including six systems that are close analogs of the M31-M32 system). Contrary to the previously assumed scenario that such objects are predominantly products of tidal stripping, our results suggest a more prevalent role for ram pressure in their formation. Indeed, 76% (173) of these CSSs are formed through a burst of star formation occurring around the time of the first pericentric passage, typically at redshifts $z\lesssim1$, aided by strong ram pressure and tidal forces. The high ram pressure, resulting from the CSSs' rapid motion near the halo center, facilitates metal enrichment, producing high-metallicity CSSs by confining the metal-rich gas from bursty star formation, which leads to distinct stellar populations characterized by enhanced metallicity as well as high $\alpha$-abundance. Only the remaining 24% (54) of metal-rich CSSs are generated through the tidal stripping of massive progenitors. Our results further indicate that M32 is more likely to have formed through intense star formation events rather than through gradual, tidal stripping, thereby providing crucial insights into the nature of low mass, compact galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>EDGE-INFERNO: Simulating every observable star in faint dwarf galaxies and their consequences for resolved-star photometric surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretation of data from faint dwarf galaxies is made challenging by observations limited to only the brightest stars. We present a major improvement to tackle this challenge by undertaking zoomed cosmological simulations that resolve the evolution of all individual stars more massive than $0.5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, thereby explicitly tracking all observable stars for the Hubble time. For the first time, we predict observable color-magnitude diagrams and the spatial distribution of $\approx 100,000$ stars within four faint ($M_{\star} \approx 10^5 \, \,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) dwarf galaxies directly from their cosmological initial conditions. In all cases, simulations predict complex light profiles with multiple components, implying that typical observational measures of structural parameters can make total V-band magnitudes appear up to 0.5 mag dimmer compared to estimates from simulations. Furthermore, when only small ($\lessapprox100$) numbers of stars are observable, shot noise from realizations of the color-magnitude diagram introduces uncertainties comparable to the population scatter in, e.g., total magnitude, half-light radius, and mean iron abundance measurements. Estimating these uncertainties with fully self-consistent mass growth, star formation and chemical enrichment histories paves the way for more robust interpretation of dwarf galaxy data.</description>

      <title>Age-dating early quiescent galaxies: high star-formation efficiency, but consistent with direct, higher-redshift observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift $z=3.2$, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We study on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of $M_{\star} \approx 10^{11.4}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ (surviving mass $M_{\star\mathrm{,surv}} \approx 10^{11.2}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and a specific star-formation rate of $\mathrm{sSFR} \approx 0.03$ Gyr$^{-1}$, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of $1.3-1.8$ Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of $z&gt;6$ galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of $f_{\star}=M_{\star}/(f_b \cdot M_{\rm h}) \approx 100\%$ at $z=7-12$, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments -- as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 -- the stellar fractions could be reduced to $f_{\star} \approx 50\%$, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in $z&gt;6$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Stellar halos tracing the assembly of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Abridged]Ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are expected to be the relics of the earliest galaxies forming in the Universe. Observations show the presence of a stellar halo around them, which can give precious insights into the evolution of UFDs. This work investigates how merger properties impact the formation of stellar halos around UFDs, focusing on Tucana II, the most promising UFD assembled through mergers. We develop N-body simulations of isolated mergers between two UFDs with $1M_\odot$ stellar resolution. We build a suite of simulations by varying: i) the merger mass ratio, $M_1/M_2$, the specific ii) kinetic energy, $k$, and iii) angular momentum, $l$, iv) the dark-to-stellar mass ratio, $M_{DM}/M_*$, of the progenitors and iv) their stellar size, $R_{1/2}$. We use a neural network to explore the parameter space, emulating the properties of the "post-merger" UFD by quantifying the half-mass radius ($R_*$) and the fraction of stars at radii $&gt;5R_*$ ($f_5$). Our principal component analysis clearly shows that $f_5$ ($R_*$) is primarily determined by $M_1/M_2$ ($R_{1/2}$), with $R_{1/2}$ ($M_1/M_2$) playing a secondary role. Both $f_5$ and $R_*$ show almost no dependence on $k$, $l$, and $M_{DM}/M_*$ in the explored range. Using our emulator, we find that to form the stellar halo observed in Tucana II, i.e. $f_5=10\pm5\%$ and $R_*=120\pm30$pc, we need $M_1/M_2=8_{-3}^{+4}$ and $R_{1/2}=97^{+25}_{-18}$pc. Such findings are corroborated by the consistency ($\chi^2=0.5-2$) between the stellar density profile observed and those of simulations having $M_1/M_2$ and $R_{1/2}$ close to the emulator's predictions. Ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys will greatly increase the statistics of observed stars and thus stellar halos in UFDs. By interpreting such observations with our model, we will provide new insights into the assembly history of UFDs and thus on the early galaxy formation process.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the gap between real and simulated nebulae: A domain-adaptation approach to classify ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifying ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies is crucial to studying stellar feedback mechanisms and understanding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium. This classification task is generally performed by comparing observed line ratios with photoionisation simulations of different types of nebulae (HII regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants). However, due to simplifying assumptions, such simulations are generally unable to fully reproduce the line ratios in observed nebulae. This discrepancy limits the performance of the classical machine-learning approach, where a model is trained on the simulated data and then used to classify real nebulae. For this study, we used a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to bridge the gap between photoionisation models (source domain) and observed ionised nebulae from the PHANGS-MUSE survey (target domain). The DANN is an example of a domain-adaptation algorithm, whose goal is to maximise the performance of a model trained on labelled data in the source domain on an unlabelled target domain by extracting domain-invariant features. Our results indicate a significant improvement in classification performance in the target domain when employing the DANN framework compared to a classical neural network (NN) classifier. Additionally, we investigated the impact of adding noise to the source dataset, finding that noise injection acts as a form of regularisation, further enhancing the performances of both the NN and DANN models on the observational data. The combined use of domain adaptation and noise injection improved the classification accuracy in the target domain by 23%. This study highlights the potential of domain adaptation methods in tackling the domain-shift challenge when using theoretical models to train machine-learning pipelines in astronomy.</description>

Abstract: We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-$\alpha$ emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a $z=1.1$ main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f$_\mathrm{mol}$ = 0.44 $\pm$ 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A$_\mathrm{V}$ = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z$\sim$1.</description>

      <title>The formation and stability of a cold disc made out of stellar winds in the Galactic Centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reported discovery of a cold (~10$^4$ K) disc-like structure within 0.005 pc around the super-massive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, has challenged our understanding of the gas dynamics and thermodynamic state of the plasma in its immediate vicinity. State-of-the-art simulations do not agree on whether or not such a disc can be a product of the multiple stellar wind interactions of the mass-losing stars in the region. This study aims to constrain the conditions for the formation of a cold disc as a natural outcome of the system of the mass-losing stars orbiting around Sgr A*, to investigate whether the disc is a transient or long-lasting structure, and to assess the validity of the model through direct comparisons with observations. We performed a set of hydrodynamic simulations of the observed Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars feeding Sgr A* using the finite-volume adaptive mesh refinement code Ramses. We focus, for the first time, on the impact of the chemical composition of the plasma emanating from the WR stars. The simulations show that the chemical composition of the plasma affects the radiative cooling enough to impact the properties of the medium, such as density and temperature, and, as a consequence, the rate at which the material inflows onto Sgr A*. We demonstrate that the formation of a cold disc from the stellar winds is possible for certain chemical compositions that are consistent with the current observational constraints. However, even in such cases, it is not possible to reproduce the reported properties of the observed disc-like structure, namely its inclination and the fluxes of its hydrogen recombination lines. We conclude that the stellar winds alone are not sufficient to form the cold disc around Sgr A* inferred from observations. Either relevant ingredients are still missing in the model, or the interpretation of the observed data needs to be revised.</description>

      <title>Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Assessing the dark matter content of two quasar host galaxies at z~6 through gas kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a study of the gas kinematics of two quasar host galaxies at $z\gtrsim6$ traced by the [CII] emission line using ALMA. By combining deep observations at both low and high resolution, we recover the diffuse emission, resolve its structure, and measure the rotation curves from the inner region of the galaxy to its outskirts using DysmalPy and 3DBarolo. Assuming that both galaxies exhibit disk rotation driven by the gravitational potential of the galaxy, we find that the best-fit disk models have a $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 2$ and inferred circular velocities out to $\sim$6-8 kpc scales, well beyond the likely stellar distribution. We then determine the mass profiles of each component (stars, gas, dark matter) with priors on the baryon and dark matter properties. We find relatively large dark matter fractions within their effective radii ($f_{\rm DM}(R&lt;R_e)$ = $0.61_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ and $0.53_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$, respectively), which are significantly larger than those extrapolated from lower redshift studies and remain robust under different input parameters verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. The large $f_{\rm DM}(R&lt;R_e)$ corresponds to halo masses of $\sim 10^{12.5}-10^{12.8}\, M_\odot$, thus representative of the most massive halos at these redshifts. Notably, while the masses of these SMBHs are approximately 1 dex higher than the low-redshift relationship with stellar mass, the closer alignment of SMBH and halo masses with a local relationship may indicate that the early formation of these SMBHs is linked to their dark matter halos, providing insights into the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: The (sub)millimeter sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub)millimeter telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>A kinematical study of the launching region of the blueshifted HH 46/47 outflow with SINFONI K-band observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying outflows is important as they may significantly contribute to angular momentum removal from the star/disk system, affecting disk evolution and planet formation. To investigate the different outflow components; the collimated jet, wide-angled molecular outflow, and outflow cavity, of the Class I HH 46/47 outflow system. We focus on their kinematics. We present Near Infrared (NIR) K-band integral field observations of the blue-shifted HH 46/47 outflow base obtained using VLT/SINFONI with an angular resolution of 0".81. Our analysis focuses on [Fe II], H2 1-0 S(1), and, Br-gamma emission. We employ a wavelength recalibration technique based on OH telluric lines to probe the kinematics of the wide-angled flow with an accuracy of 1 km/s - 3 km/s. A velocity gradient of 10 km/s transverse to the outflow direction is confirmed in the wide-angled H2 outflow cavity. The H2 cavity peaks at radial velocities of -15 km/s to -30 km/s, and the atomic jet at v = -210 km/s. The outflow exhibits a layered structure; the high-velocity [Fe II] and Br-gamma jet is surrounded by a wide-angled H2 outflow cavity, which is in turn nested within the continuum emission and CO molecular outflow. The continuum emission and H2 outflow cavity are asymmetric with respect to the jet axis. We propose that the origin of the asymmetries and the velocity gradient detected in the wide-angled H2 cavity, is due to a wide-angled outflow or successive jet bowshocks expanding into an inhomogeneous ambient medium, or the presence of a secondary outflow. We eliminate outflow rotation as an exclusive origin of this velocity gradient due to large specific angular momenta values, J(r)= 3000 - 4000 km/s au calculated from 1" to 2" along the outflow. The observations reveal the complexities inherent in outflow systems, and the risk of attributing transverse velocity gradients solely to rotation.</description>

      <title>Forecasts and Statistical Insights for Line Intensity Mapping Cross-Correlations: A Case Study with 21cm x [CII]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity mapping -- the large-scale mapping of selected spectral lines without resolving individual sources -- is quickly emerging as an efficient way to conduct large cosmological surveys. Multiple surveys covering a variety of lines (such as the hydrogen 21cm hyperfine line, CO rotational lines, and [CII] fine structure lines, among others) are either observing or will soon be online, promising a panchromatic view of our Universe over a broad redshift range. With multiple lines potentially covering the same volume, cross-correlations have become an attractive prospect, both for probing the underlying astrophysics and for mitigating observational systematics. For example, cross correlating 21cm and [CII] intensity maps during reionization could reveal the characteristic scale of ionized bubbles around the first galaxies, while simultaneously providing a convenient way to reduce independent foreground contaminants between the two surveys. However, many of the desirable properties of cross-correlations in principle emerge only under ideal conditions, such as infinite ensemble averages. In this paper, we construct an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing intensity mapping cross-correlations, enabling instrumental effects, foreground residuals, and analysis choices to be propagated through Monte Carlo simulations to a set of rigorous error properties, including error covariances, window functions, and full probability distributions for power spectrum estimates. We use this framework to critically examine the applicability of simplifying assumptions such as the independence and Gaussianity of power spectrum errors. As worked examples, we forecast the sensitivity of near-term and futuristic 21cm-[CII] cross-correlation measurements, providing recommendations for survey design.</description>

      <title>The size of accretion disks from self-consistent X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry fitting: applications to ASASSN-14li and HLX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius ($R_{\rm out}$) as a free parameter, integrating it into standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data ($\Delta t \approx 350-1300$ days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. We show that at these late-times the multi-wavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) of $7^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$, consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations; and an $R_{\rm out}$ of $45 \pm 13 \, R_{\rm g}$, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations on the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate HLX-1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX-1, we find $M_{\rm BH} = 4^{+3}_{-1} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm out} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{3} \, R_{\rm g}$, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination ($i$) of HLX-1 to be $10^o \leq i \leq 70^o$.</description>

      <title>Inner structure of cold and warm dark matter halos from particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the number of apocenter passages $p$ and the radial action $J_r$ of each particle, we characterize the phase-space structure within the multi-stream regions of cold and warm dark matter halos in cosmological $N$-body simulations. Building on previous work by Enomoto et al. (2024), we analyze the radial density profiles of particles classified by $p$ and $J_r$. We find that the profiles consistently follow a double power-law structure, independent of the dark matter model or halo mass. The inner profile exhibits a $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ behavior, which is consistent with previous studies. Notably, this characteristics persist across both classification schemes. In contrast, the outer power-law profiles display distinct behaviors depending on the classification. While particles classified by $p$ exhibit a steeper slope, ranging from $-6$ to $-8$, those classified by $J_r$ follow a common slope of approximately $-3.5$. Overall, the amplitude of the double power-law profiles varies between simulations for different dark matter models, but this variation can be attributed to statistical differences in the concentration of halos across the models.</description>

      <title>Predicting metallicities and carbon abundances from Gaia XP spectra for (carbon-enhanced) metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carbon-rich (C-rich) stars can be found at all metallicities and evolutionary stages. They are often the result of mass-transfer from a companion, but some of the most metal-poor C-rich objects are likely carrying the imprint of the metal-free First Stars from birth. In this work, we employ a neural network to predict metallicities and carbon abundances for over 10 million stars with Gaia low-resolution XP spectra, down to [Fe/H] = -3.0 and up to [C/Fe] $\approx$ +2. We identify ~2000 high-confidence bright (G&lt;16) carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 and [C/Fe] &gt; +0.7. The majority of our C-rich candidates have [Fe/H] &gt; -2.0 and are expected to be binary mass-transfer products, supported by high barium abundances in GALAH and/or their Gaia RUWE and radial velocity variations. We confirm previous findings of an increase in C-rich stars with decreasing metallicity, adopting a definition of $3\sigma$ outliers from the [C/Fe] distribution, although our frequency appears to flatten for -3.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 at a level of 6-7%. We also find that the fraction of C-rich stars is low among globular cluster stars (connected to their lower binary fraction), and that it decreases for field stars more tightly bound to the Milky Way. We interpret these last results as evidence that disrupted globular clusters contribute more in the inner Galaxy, supporting previous work. Homogeneous samples like these are key to understanding the full population properties of C-rich stars, and this is just the beginning.</description>

      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes "dangerous". We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as "red nugget relics", as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deconvolution of Astronomical Images with Diffusion Models: Quantifying Prior-Driven Features in Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconvolution of astronomical images is a key aspect of recovering the intrinsic properties of celestial objects, especially when considering ground-based observations. This paper explores the use of diffusion models (DMs) and the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) algorithm to solve this inverse problem task. We apply score-based DMs trained on high-resolution cosmological simulations, through a Bayesian setting to compute a posterior distribution given the observations available. By considering the redshift and the pixel scale as parameters of our inverse problem, the tool can be easily adapted to any dataset. We test our model on Hyper Supreme Camera (HSC) data and show that we reach resolutions comparable to those obtained by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Most importantly, we quantify the uncertainty of reconstructions and propose a metric to identify prior-driven features in the reconstructed images, which is key in view of applying these methods for scientific purposes.</description>
