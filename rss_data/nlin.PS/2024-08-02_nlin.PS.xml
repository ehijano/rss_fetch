      <title>Ultra-high-amplitude Peregrine solitons induced by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the model of a spatially non-uniform Bose-Einstein condensate with helicoidal spin-orbit (SO) coupling, we find abnormal Peregrine solitons (PSs) on top of flat and periodic backgrounds, with ultra-high amplitudes. We explore the roles of the SO coupling strength and helicity pitch in the creation of these anomalously tall PSs and find that their amplitude, normalized to the background height, attains indefinitely large values. The investigation of the modulation instability (MI) in the same system demonstrates that these PSs exist in a range of relatively weak MI, maintaining the feasibility of their experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Wind-wave interaction in finite depth: linear and nonlinear approaches, blow-up and soliton breaking in finite time, integrability perspectives</title>

Abstract: This work is an analytical investigation of the evolution of surface water waves in Miles and Jeffreys theories of wind wave interaction in water of finite depth. The present review is divided into two major parts. The first corresponds to the surface water waves in a linear regime and its nonlinear extensions. In this part, Miles theory of wave amplification by wind is extended to the case of finite depth. The dispersion relation provides a wave growth rate depending on depth. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with the data from the Australian Shallow Water Experiment and the data from the Lake George experiment. In the second part of this study, Jeffreys theory of wave amplification by wind is extended to the case of finite depth, where the Serre-Green-Naghdi is derived. We find the solitary wave solution of the system, with an increasing amplitude under the action of the wind. This continuous increase in amplitude leads to the soliton breaking and blow-up of the surface wave in finite time. The theoretical blow-up time is calculated based on actual experimental data. By applying an appropriate perturbation method, the SGN equation yields Korteweg de Vries Burger equation (KdVB). We show that the continuous transfer of energy from wind to water results in the growth of the KdVB soliton amplitude, velocity, acceleration, and energy over time while its effective wavelength decreases. This phenomenon differs from the classical results of Jeffreys approach due to finite depth. Again, blow-up and breaking occur in finite time. These times are calculated and expressed for soliton- and wind-appropriate parameters and values. These values are measurable in usual experimental facilities. The kinematics of the breaking is studied, and a detailed analysis of the breaking time is conducted using various criteria. Finally, some integrability perspectives are presented.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of vortex pairing in transitional jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the onset of linear instabilities and their later nonlinear interactions in the shear layer of an initially-laminar jet using a combination of stability analysis and data from high-fidelity flow simulations. We provide a complete picture of the vortex-pairing process. Hydrodynamic instabilities initiate the transition to turbulence, causing the shear layer to spread rapidly. In this process, the shear layer rolls up to form vortices, accompanied by the exponential growth of the fundamental frequency. As the fundamental frequency grows, it gains energy from the mean flow. Subsequently, as it saturates and begins to decay, the fundamental vortices start to pair. During this vortex pairing process, the subharmonic vortex acquires energy both linearly from the mean flow and nonlinearly through a reverse cascade from the fundamental. The process concludes when the subharmonic vortex eventually saturates. Similarly, two subharmonic vortices merge to form a second subharmonic vortex. Our results confirm Kelly's (1967) hypothesis of a resonance mechanism between the fundamental and subharmonic, which supplies energy to the subharmonic. In this multi-tonal, convective-dominated flow, we clarify the ambiguity surrounding the fundamental frequency by demonstrating that the spatially most amplified frequency should be considered fundamental, rather than the structure associated with the spectral energy peak. For the initially-laminar jet considered here, the fundamental frequency corresponds to the fourth largest spectral peak, highlighting the important distinction between the energetically and dynamical significance of a tone. Despite its low energy, the fundamental frequency is dynamically dominant as it determines all other spectral peaks and supplies energy to the subharmonics through a reverse energy cascade.</description>
