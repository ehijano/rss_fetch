      <title>Enhanced Cross-Dataset Electroencephalogram-based Emotion Recognition using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition has significant potential in healthcare and affect-sensitive systems such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, challenges such as the high cost of labeled data and variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals limit the applicability of EEG-based emotion recognition models across domains. These challenges are exacerbated in cross-dataset scenarios due to differences in subject demographics, recording devices, and presented stimuli. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to improve cross-domain EEG-based emotion classification. Our method, Gradual Proximity-guided Target Data Selection (GPTDS), incrementally selects reliable target domain samples for training. By evaluating their proximity to source clusters and the models confidence in predicting them, GPTDS minimizes negative transfer caused by noisy and diverse samples. Additionally, we introduce Prediction Confidence-aware Test-Time Augmentation (PC-TTA), a cost-effective augmentation technique. Unlike traditional TTA methods, which are computationally intensive, PC-TTA activates only when model confidence is low, improving inference performance while drastically reducing computational costs. Experiments on the DEAP and SEED datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. When trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, our model achieves 67.44% accuracy, a 7.09% improvement over the baseline. Conversely, training on SEED and testing on DEAP yields 59.68% accuracy, a 6.07% improvement. Furthermore, PC-TTA reduces computational time by a factor of 15 compared to traditional TTA methods. Our method excels in detecting both positive and negative emotions, demonstrating its practical utility in healthcare applications.

      <title>Disco Intelligent Omni-Surfaces: 360-degree Fully-Passive Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent omni-surfaces (IOSs) with 360-degree electromagnetic radiation significantly improves the performance of wireless systems, while an adversarial IOS also poses a significant potential risk for physical layer security. In this paper, we propose a "DISCO" IOS (DIOS) based fully-passive jammer (FPJ) that can launch omnidirectional fully-passive jamming attacks. In the proposed DIOS-based FPJ, the interrelated refractive and reflective (R&amp;R) coefficients of the adversarial IOS are randomly generated, acting like a "DISCO" that distributes wireless energy radiated by the base station. By introducing active channel aging (ACA) during channel coherence time, the DIOS-based FPJ can perform omnidirectional fully-passive jamming without neither jamming power nor channel knowledge of legitimate users (LUs). To characterize the impact of the DIOS-based PFJ, we derive the statistical characteristics of DIOS-jammed channels based on two widely-used IOS models, i.e., the constant-amplitude model and the variable-amplitude model. Consequently, the asymptotic analysis of the ergodic achievable sum rates under the DIOS-based omnidirectional fully-passive jamming is given based on the derived stochastic characteristics for both the two IOS models. Based on the derived analysis, the omnidirectional jamming impact of the proposed DIOS-based FPJ implemented by a constant-amplitude IOS does not depend on either the quantization number or the stochastic distribution of the DIOS coefficients, while the conclusion does not hold on when a variable-amplitude IOS is used. Numerical results based on one-bit quantization of the IOS phase shifts are provided to verify the effectiveness of the derived theoretical analysis. The proposed DIOS-based FPJ can not only launch omnidirectional fully-passive jamming, but also improve the jamming impact by about 55% at 10 dBm transmit power per LU.</description>

      <title>Enhanced average for event-related potential analysis using dynamic time warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a way to understand, and evaluate neurotransmission. In this context, time-locked EEG activity or event-related potentials (ERPs) are often used to capture neural activity related to specific mental processes. Normally, they are considered on the basis of averages across a number of trials. However, there exist notable variability in latency jitter, jitter, and amplitude, across trials, and, also, across users; this causes the average ERP waveform to blur, and, furthermore, diminish the amplitude of underlying waves. For these reasons, a strategy is proposed for obtaining ERP waveforms based on dynamic time warping (DTW) to adapt, and adjust individual trials to the averaged ERP, previously calculated, to build an enhanced average by making use of these warped signals. At the sight of the experiments carried out on the behaviour of the proposed scheme using publicly available datasets, this strategy reduces the attenuation in amplitude of ERP components thanks to the reduction of the influence of variability of latency and jitter, and, thus, improves the averaged ERP waveforms.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Radar and Communication with Rate-Splitting Wireless Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the coexistence of sensing and communication functionalities in a base station (BS) serving a communication user in the uplink and simultaneously detecting a radar target with the same frequency resources. To address inter-functionality interference, we employ rate-splitting (RS) at the communication user and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the joint radar-communication receiver at the BS. This approach is motivated by RS's proven effectiveness in mitigating inter-user interference among communication users. Building on the proposed system model based on RS, we derive inner bounds on performance in terms of ergodic data information rate for communication and ergodic radar estimation information rate for sensing. Additionally, we present a closed-form solution for the optimal power split in RS that maximizes the communication user's performance. The bounds achieved with RS are compared to conventional methods, including spectral isolation and full spectral sharing with SIC. We demonstrate that RS offers a superior performance trade-off between sensing and communication functionalities compared to traditional approaches. Pertinently, while the original concept of RS deals only with digital signals, this work brings forward RS as a general method for including non-orthogonal access for sensing signals. As a consequence, the work done in this paper provides a systematic and parametrized way to effectuate non-orthogonal sensing and communication waveforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Assessment of Human Blockage at sub-THz and mmWave Frequency Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth generation (5G) of mobile communications relies on extremely high data transmissions using a large variety of frequency bands, such as FR1 (sub-6 GHz) and FR2 (mmWave). Future mobile communications envisage using electromagnetic spectrum beyond FR2, i.e. above 100 GHz, known as sub-THz band. These new frequencies open up challenging scenarios where communications shall rely on a major contribution such as the line-of-sight (LoS) component. To the best of the authors' knowledge, for the first time in literature this work studies the human blockage effects over an extremely wide frequency band from 75 GHz to 215 GHz given: (i) the distance between the blocker and the antennas and (ii) the body orientation. Furthermore, the obtained results are modeled with the classical path loss models and compared to 3GPP alternatives. The average losses increase from 42 dB to 56 dB when frequency rises from 75 GHz to 215 GHz. In terms of distance, a 18 dB increment in the received power is found when the Tx--Rx separation is increased from 1 m to 2.5 m. Finally, the blocker orientation induces variations of up to 4.6 dB.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Real-Time Source Reconstruction and Broadband Services Over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a flexible and efficient sharing of wireless resources among a wide range of novel applications and services is one of the major goals of the sixth-generation of mobile systems (6G). Accordingly, this work investigates the performance of a real-time system that coexists with a broadband service in a frame-based wireless channel. Specifically, we consider real-time remote tracking of an information source, where a device monitors its evolution and sends updates to a base station (BS), which is responsible for real-time source reconstruction and, potentially, remote actuation. To achieve this, the BS employs a grant-free access mechanism to serve the monitoring device together with a broadband user, which share the available wireless resources through orthogonal or non-orthogonal multiple access schemes. We analyse the performance of the system with time-averaged reconstruction error, time-averaged cost of actuation error, and update-delivery cost as performance metrics. Furthermore, we analyse the performance of the broadband user in terms of throughput and energy efficiency. Our results show that an orthogonal resource sharing between the users is beneficial in most cases where the broadband user requires maximum throughput. However, sharing the resources in a non-orthogonal manner leads to a far greater energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Energy-based features and bi-LSTM neural network for EEG-based music and voice classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain receives stimuli in multiple ways; among them, audio constitutes an important source of relevant stimuli for the brain regarding communication, amusement, warning, etc. In this context, the aim of this manuscript is to advance in the classification of brain responses to music of diverse genres and to sounds of different nature: speech and music. For this purpose, two different experiments have been designed to acquiere EEG signals from subjects listening to songs of different musical genres and sentences in various languages. With this, a novel scheme is proposed to characterize brain signals for their classification; this scheme is based on the construction of a feature matrix built on relations between energy measured at the different EEG channels and the usage of a bi-LSTM neural network. With the data obtained, evaluations regarding EEG-based classification between speech and music, different musical genres, and whether the subject likes the song listened to or not are carried out. The experiments unveil satisfactory performance to the proposed scheme. The results obtained for binary audio type classification attain 98.66% of success. In multi-class classification between 4 musical genres, the accuracy attained is 61.59%, and results for binary classification of musical taste rise to 96.96%.</description>

      <title>EEG Signal Denoising Using pix2pix GAN: Enhancing Neurological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is essential in neuroscience and clinical practice, yet it suffers from physiological artifacts, particularly electromyography (EMG), which distort signals. We propose a deep learning model using pix2pixGAN to remove such noise and generate reliable EEG signals. Leveraging the EEGdenoiseNet dataset, we created synthetic datasets with controlled EMG noise levels for model training and testing across a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7 to 2. Our evaluation metrics included RRMSE and Pearson's CC, assessing both time and frequency domains, and compared our model with others. The pix2pixGAN model excelled, especially under high noise conditions, showing significant improvements in lower RRMSE and higher CC values. This demonstrates the model's superior accuracy and stability in purifying EEG signals, offering a robust solution for EEG analysis challenges and advancing clinical and neuroscience applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Localization with Base Station-Integrated Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to efficient localization in next-generation communication systems through a base station (BS)-enabled passive beamforming utilizing beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs). Unlike conventional diagonal RISs (D-RISs), which suffer from limited beamforming capability, a BD-RIS provides enhanced control over both phase and amplitude, significantly improving localization accuracy. By conducting a comprehensive Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis across various system parameters in both near-field and far-field scenarios, we establish the BD-RIS structure as a competitive alternative to traditional active antenna arrays. Our results reveal that BD-RISs achieve near active antenna arrays performance in localization precision, overcoming the limitations of D-RISs and underscoring its potential for high-accuracy positioning in future communication networks. This work envisions the use of BD-RIS for enabling passive beamforming-based localization, setting the stage for more efficient and scalable localization strategies in sixth-generation networks and beyond.</description>

      <title>A CSI Feedback Framework based on Transmitting the Important Values and Generating the Others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback frameworks in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has significantly improved reconstruction accuracy. However, the limited generalization of widely adopted autoencoder-based networks for CSI feedback challenges consistent performance under dynamic wireless channel conditions and varying communication overhead constraints. To enhance the robustness of DL-based CSI feedback across diverse channel scenarios, we propose a novel framework, ITUG, where the user equipment (UE) transmits only a selected portion of critical values in the CSI matrix, while a generative model deployed at the BS reconstructs the remaining values. Specifically, we introduce a scoring algorithm to identify important values based on amplitude and contrast, an encoding algorithm to convert these values into a bit stream for transmission using adaptive bit length and a modified Huffman codebook, and a Transformer-based generative network named TPMVNet to recover the untransmitted values based on the received important values. Experimental results demonstrate that the ITUG framework, equipped with a single TPMVNet, achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to several high-performance autoencoder models across various channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information-oriented ISAC Beamforming Design under Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) beamforming design were mostly designed under perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), limiting their use in practical dynamic environments. In this paper, we study the beamforming design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC systems based on statistical CSI, with the weighted mutual information (MI) comprising sensing and communication perspectives adopted as the performance metric. In particular, the operator-valued free probability theory is utilized to derive the closed-form expression for the weighted MI under statistical CSI. Subsequently, an efficient projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix with the aim of maximizing the weighted MI.Numerical results validate that the derived closed-form expression matches well with the Monte Carlo simulation results and the proposed optimization algorithm is able to improve the weighted MI significantly. We also illustrate the trade-off between sensing and communication MI.</description>

      <title>Multipath Mitigation Technology-integrated GNSS Direct Position Estimation Plug-in Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct position estimation (DPE) is an effective solution to the MP issue at the signal processing level. Unlike two-step positioning (2SP) receivers, DPE directly solves for the receiver position, velocity, and time (PVT) in the navigation domain, without the estimation of intermediate measurements, thus allowing it to provide more robust and accurate PVT estimates in the presence of multipath (MP) and weak signals. But GNSS positioning with DPE is mostly left unapplied commercially, and continuing research into DPE has remained relatively stagnant over the past few years. To encourage further research on DPE by the GNSS community, we propose a DPE plug-in module that can be integrated into the conventional 2SP software-defined receivers (SDRs). Programmed in MATLAB, the proposed DPE plug-in module is aimed for better understanding and familiarity of a practical implementation of DPE. Its plug-in module architecture allows it to be incorporated with 2SP MATLAB SDRs, both vector tracking and scalar tracking with minimum changes, making it easy to use, and provides greater flexibility for researchers using various 2SP SDRs. Since the proposed DPE implementation makes use of tracking observables from 2SP to propagate the channel, we propose to further improve the performance of DPE against MP through using MP-compensated observables generated from Multipath Mitigation Technology (MMT)-aided tracking. Referred to as Multipath Mitigation Technology (MMT)-integrated DPE, it is proposed as a variant of DPE that is better suit for urban environment applications. Results show that while in MP-only conditions, an MMT-integrated 2SP has similar performance with MMT-integrated DPE, the proposed MMT-integrated DPE manages to show great superiority against non-line-of-sight (NLOS), making it the preferable option for applications in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Physically-Consistent Modeling of Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable electromagnetic structures (REMSs), such as reconfigurable reflectarrays (RRAs) or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), hold significant potential to improve wireless communication and sensing systems. Even though several REMS modeling approaches have been proposed in recent years, the literature lacks models that are both computationally efficient and physically consistent. As a result, algorithms that control the reconfigurable elements of REMSs (e.g., the phase shifts of an RIS) are often built on simplistic models that are inaccurate. To enable physically accurate REMS-parameter tuning, we present a new framework for efficient and physically consistent modeling of general REMSs. Our modeling method combines a circuit-theoretic approach with a new formalism that describes a REMS's interaction with the electromagnetic (EM) waves in its far-field region. Our modeling method enables efficient computation of the entire far-field radiation pattern for arbitrary configurations of the REMS reconfigurable elements once a single full-wave EM simulation of the non-reconfigurable parts of the REMS has been performed. The predictions made by the proposed framework align with the physical laws of classical electrodynamics and model effects caused by inter-antenna coupling, non-reciprocal materials, polarization, ohmic losses, matching losses, influence of metallic housings, noise from low-noise amplifiers, and noise arising in or received by antennas. In order to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our modeling approach, we (i) compare our modeling method to EM simulations and (ii) conduct a case study involving a planar RRA that enables simultaneous multiuser beam- and null-forming using a new, computationally efficient, and physically accurate parameter tuning algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Multi-Band Channel Characterization in the Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following paper provides a multi-band channel measurement analysis on the frequency range (FR)3. This study focuses on the FR3 low frequencies 6.5 GHz and 8.75 GHz with a setup tailored to the context of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where the data are collected with and without the presence of a target. A method based on multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is used to refine the delays of the channel impulse response estimates. The results reveal that the channel at the lower frequency 6.5 GHz has additional distinguishable multipath components in the presence of the target, while the one associated with the higher frequency 8.75 GHz has more blockage. The set of results reported in this paper serves as a benchmark for future multi-band studies in the FR3 spectrum.</description>

      <title>NCAirFL: CSI-Free Over-the-Air Federated Learning Based on Non-Coherent Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air federated learning (FL), i.e., AirFL, leverages computing primitively over multiple access channels. A long-standing challenge in AirFL is to achieve coherent signal alignment without relying on expensive channel estimation and feedback. This paper proposes NCAirFL, a CSI-free AirFL scheme based on unbiased non-coherent detection at the edge server. By exploiting binary dithering and a long-term memory based error-compensation mechanism, NCAirFL achieves a convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the average square norm of the gradient for general non-convex and smooth objectives, where $T$ is the number of communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of NCAirFL compared to vanilla FL with ideal communications and to coherent transmission-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptive Unfolded Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, graph neural networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in numerous graph machine learning tasks. In real-world applications, where domain shifts occur and labels are often unavailable for a new target domain, graph domain adaptation (GDA) approaches have been proposed to facilitate knowledge transfer from the source domain to the target domain. Previous efforts in tackling distribution shifts across domains have mainly focused on aligning the node embedding distributions generated by the GNNs in the source and target domains. However, as the core part of GDA approaches, the impact of the underlying GNN architecture has received limited attention. In this work, we explore this orthogonal direction, i.e., how to facilitate GDA with architectural enhancement. In particular, we consider a class of GNNs that are designed explicitly based on optimization problems, namely unfolded GNNs (UGNNs), whose training process can be represented as bi-level optimization. Empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate that when transferring from the source domain to the target domain, the lower-level objective value generated by the UGNNs significantly increases, resulting in an increase in the upper-level objective as well. Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple yet effective strategy called cascaded propagation (CP), which is guaranteed to decrease the lower-level objective value. The CP strategy is widely applicable to general UGNNs, and we evaluate its efficacy with three representative UGNN architectures. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the UGNNs integrated with CP outperform state-of-the-art GDA baselines.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Communication and Tracking using Fused Bistatic Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bistatic sensing-assisted beam tracking method for simultaneous communication and tracking of user vehicles navigating arbitrary-shaped road trajectories. Prior work on simultaneous communication and tracking assumes a colocated radar receiver at the transmitter for sensing measurements using the reflected Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) signals in the mmWave band. Full isolation between transmitter and receiver is required here to avoid self-interference. We consider the bistatic setting where the sensing receivers are not colocated and can be realized in practice using traditional half-duplex transmit or receive nodes. First, we process the echoes reflected from the vehicle at multiple multi-antenna nodes at various locations, facilitating estimation of the vehicle's current position. Then, we propose selection criteria for the estimates and a maximum likelihood (ML) fusion scheme to fuse these selected estimates based on the estimated error covariance matrices of these measurements. This fusion scheme is important in bistatic and multistatic settings as the localization error depends significantly on the geometry of the transmitter, target, and receiver locations. Finally, we predict the vehicle's next location using a simple kinematic equation-based model. Through extensive simulation, we study the average spectral efficiency of communication with a moving user using the proposed simultaneous communication and tracking scheme. The proposed fusion-based scheme achieves almost the same average spectral efficiency as an ideal scheme that knows the exact trajectory. We also show that the proposed scheme can be easily extended to systems with Hybrid Digital-Analog architectures and performs similarly even in these systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Synthesis Denoisers for Forward-Backward Plug-and-Play Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the behavior of the forward-backward (FB) algorithm when the proximity operator is replaced by a sub-iterative procedure to approximate a Gaussian denoiser, in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion. In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</description>

      <title>Geometry-informed Channel Statistics Prediction Based upon Uncalibrated Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) of wireless environments can be utilized to predict the propagation channel and reduce the overhead of required to estimate the channel statistics. However, direct channel prediction requires data-intensive calibration of the DT to capture the environment properties relevant for propagation of electromagnetic signals. We introduce a framework that starts from a satellite image of the environment to produce an uncalibrated DT, which has no or imprecise information about the materials and their electromagnetic properties. The key idea is to use the uncalibrated DT to implicitly provide a geometric prior for the environment. This is utilized to inform a Gaussian process (GP), which permits the use of few channel measurements to attain an accurate prediction of the channel statistics. Additionally, the framework is able to quantify the uncertainty in channel statistics prediction and select rate in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) that complies with statistical guarantees. The efficacy of the proposed geometry-informed GP is validated using experimental data obtained through a measurement campaign. Furthermore, the proposed prediction framework is shown to provide significant improvements compared to the benchmarks where i) direct channel statistics prediction is obtained using an uncalibrated DT and (ii) the GP predicts channel statistics using information about the location.</description>

      <title>Eco-Friendly 0G Networks: Unlocking the Power of Backscatter Communications for a Greener Future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscatter Communication (BackCom) technology has emerged as a promising paradigm for the Green Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, offering advantages such as low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. While traditional BackCom systems, such as RFID technology, have found widespread applications, the advent of ambient backscatter presents new opportunities for expanding applications and enhancing capabilities. Moreover, ongoing standardization efforts are actively focusing on BackCom technologies, positioning them as a potential solution to meet the near-zero power consumption and massive connectivity requirements of next-generation wireless systems. 0G networks have the potential to provide advanced solutions by leveraging BackCom technology to deliver ultra-low-power, ubiquitous connectivity for the expanding IoT ecosystem, supporting billions of devices with minimal energy consumption. This paper investigates the integration of BackCom and 0G networks to enhance the capabilities of traditional BackCom systems and enable Green IoT. We conduct an in-depth analysis of BackCom-enabled 0G networks, exploring their architecture and operational objectives, and also explore the Waste Factor (WF) metric for evaluating energy efficiency and minimizing energy waste within integrated systems. By examining both structural and operational aspects, we demonstrate how this synergy enhances the performance, scalability, and sustainability of next-generation wireless networks. Moreover, we highlight possible applications, open challenges, and future directions, offering valuable insights for guiding future research and practical implementations aimed at achieving large-scale, sustainable IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-Aided Alternating Least Squares for Tensor CP Decomposition and Its Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is the mostly used model to formulate the received tensor signal in a massive MIMO system, as the receiver generally sums the components from different paths or users. To achieve accurate and low-latency channel estimation, good and fast CP decomposition (CPD) algorithms are desired. The CP alternating least squares (CPALS) is the workhorse algorithm for calculating the CPD. However, its performance depends on the initializations, and good starting values can lead to more efficient solutions. Existing initialization strategies are decoupled from the CPALS and are not necessarily favorable for solving the CPD. This paper proposes a deep-learning-aided CPALS (DL-CPALS) method that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to generate favorable initializations. The proposed DL-CPALS integrates the DNN and CPALS to a model-based deep learning paradigm, where it trains the DNN to generate an initialization that facilitates fast and accurate CPD. Moreover, benefiting from the CP low-rankness, the proposed method is trained using noisy data and does not require paired clean data. The proposed DL-CPALS is applied to millimeter wave MIMO-OFDM channel estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvements of the proposed method in terms of both speed and accuracy for CPD and channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Waveform Optimization and Beam Focusing for Near-field Wireless Power Transfer with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas and Non-linear Energy Harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology for future wireless systems. However, the low power transfer efficiency (PTE) is a critical challenge for practical implementations. One of the main inefficiency sources is the power consumption and loss introduced by key components such as high-power amplifier (HPA) and rectenna, thus they must be carefully considered for PTE optimization. Herein, we consider a near-field RF-WPT system with a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) at the transmitter and non-linear energy harvesters. We provide a mathematical framework to calculate the power consumption and harvested power from multi-tone signal transmissions. Based on this, we propose an approach relying on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation for waveform optimization and beam focusing to minimize power consumption while meeting energy harvesting requirements. Numerical results show that increasing the number of transmit tones reduces the power consumption by leveraging the rectifier's non-linearity more efficiently. Moreover, they demonstrate that increasing the antenna length improves the performance, while DMA outperforms fully-digital architecture in terms of power consumption. Finally, our results verify that the transmitter focuses the energy on receivers located in the near-field, while energy beams are formed in the receivers' direction in the far-field region.</description>

Abstract: Wireless communication systems to date primarily rely on the orthogonality of resources to facilitate the design and implementation, from user access to data transmission. Emerging applications and scenarios in the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems will require massive connectivity and transmission of a deluge of data, which calls for more flexibility in the design concept that goes beyond orthogonality. Furthermore, recent advances in signal processing and learning, e.g., deep learning, provide promising approaches to deal with complex and previously intractable problems. This article provides an overview of research efforts to date in the field of signal processing and learning for next-generation multiple access, with an emphasis on massive random access and non-orthogonal multiple access. The promising interplay with new technologies and the challenges in learning-based NGMA are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing and Communication with Intelligent Metasurfaces: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of technologies demanding high data rates and precise sensing, such as autonomous vehicles and IoT devices, has driven the popularity of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in recent years. ISAC provides a framework for communication and sensing, where both functionalities are performed simultaneously or in a coordinated manner. There are two levels of integration in ISAC: radio-communications coexistence (RCC), where communication and radar systems use distinct hardware, waveforms, and signal processing but share the spectrum; and dual-function radar-communications (DFRC), where communication and sensing share the same hardware, waveform, and signal processing. At the architectural level, intelligent metasurfaces are a key enabler for the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communication due to their ability to control the propagation environment efficiently. With the potential to enhance communication and sensing performance, numerous studies have explored the gains of metasurfaces for ISAC. Moreover, certain ISAC frameworks address limitations associated with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for communication. Thus, integrating ISAC with metasurfaces enhances both technologies. This survey reviews the literature on metasurface-assisted ISAC, detailing challenges and opportunities. To provide a comprehensive overview, we begin with fundamentals of ISAC and metasurfaces. The paper summarizes state-of-the-art studies on metasurface-assisted ISAC, focusing on metasurfaces as separate entities between the transmitter and receiver (known as RIS) and emphasizing RCC and DFRC. We also review work on holographic ISAC, where metasurfaces are part of the transmitter and receiver. For each category, lessons learned, challenges, opportunities, and research directions are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>How Much Data is Enough? Optimization of Data Collection for Artifact Detection in EEG Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used neuroimaging technique known for its cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness. However, various artifacts, particularly biological artifacts like Electromyography (EMG) signals, lead to a poor signal-to-noise ratio, limiting the precision of analyses and applications. The currently reported EEG data cleaning performance largely depends on the data used for validation, and in the case of machine learning approaches, also on the data used for training. The data are typically gathered either by recruiting subjects to perform specific artifact tasks or by integrating existing datasets. Prevailing approaches, however, tend to rely on intuitive, concept-oriented data collection with minimal justification for the selection of artifacts and their quantities. Given the substantial costs associated with biological data collection and the pressing need for effective data utilization, we propose an optimization procedure for data-oriented data collection design using deep learning-based artifact detection. Approach. We apply a binary classification between artifact epochs (time intervals containing artifacts) and non-artifact epochs (time intervals containing no artifact) using three different neural architectures. Our aim is to minimize data collection efforts while preserving the cleaning efficiency. Main results. We were able to reduce the number of artifact tasks from twelve to three and decrease repetitions of isometric contraction tasks from ten to three or sometimes even just one. Significance. Our work addresses the need for effective data utilization in biological data collection, offering a systematic and dynamic quantitative approach. By providing clear justifications for the choices of artifacts and their quantity, we aim to guide future studies toward more effective and economical data collection in EEG and EMG research.</description>

Abstract: With the emphasis on healthcare, early childhood education, and fitness, non-invasive measurement and recognition methods have received more attention. Pressure sensing has been extensively studied because of its advantages of simple structure, easy access, visualization application, and harmlessness. This paper introduces a Smart Pressure e-Mat (SPeM) system based on piezoresistive material, Velostat, for human monitoring applications, including recognition of sleeping postures, sports, and yoga. After a subsystem scans the e-mat readings and processes the signal, it generates a pressure image stream. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to fit and train the pressure image stream and recognize the corresponding human behavior. Four sleeping postures and 13 dynamic activities inspired by Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure (RFA) are used as a preliminary validation of the proposed SPeM system. The SPeM system achieves high accuracies in both applications, demonstrating the high accuracy and generalizability of the models. Compared with other pressure sensor-based systems, SPeM possesses more flexible applications and commercial application prospects, with reliable, robust, and repeatable properties.</description>

      <title>Generating Visual Stimuli from EEG Recordings using Transformer-encoder based EEG encoder and GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we tackle a modern research challenge within the field of perceptual brain decoding, which revolves around synthesizing images from EEG signals using an adversarial deep learning framework. The specific objective is to recreate images belonging to various object categories by leveraging EEG recordings obtained while subjects view those images. To achieve this, we employ a Transformer-encoder based EEG encoder to produce EEG encodings, which serve as inputs to the generator component of the GAN network. Alongside the adversarial loss, we also incorporate perceptual loss to enhance the quality of the generated images.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Low-Complexity Digital Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel low-complexity digital backpropagation (DBP) method, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between backpropagation accuracy and complexity. The method combines a split step Fourier method (SSFM)-like structure with a simplifed logarithmic perturbation method to obtain a high accuracy with a small number of DBP steps. Subband processing and asymmetric steps with optimized splitting ratio are also employed to further reduce the number of steps required to achieve a prescribed performance. The first part of the manuscript is dedicated to the derivation of a simplified logaritmic-perturbation model for the propagation of signal in an optical fiber, which serves for the development of the proposed coupled-band enhanced split step Fourier method (CB-ESSFM) and for the analytical calculation of the model coefficients. Next, the manuscript presents a DSP algorithm for the implementation of DBP based on a discrete-time version of the model and an overlap-and-save processing strategy. Practical approaches for the optimization of the coefficients used in the algorithm and of the splitting ratio of the asymmetric steps are also discussed. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity is presented. Finally, the performance and complexity of the proposed DBP method are investigated through simulations. In a five-channel 100 GHz-spaced wavelength division multiplexing system over a 15x80 km single-mode-fiber link, the proposed CB-ESSFM achieves a gain of about 1dB over simple dispersion compensation with only 15 steps (corresponding to 681 real multiplications per 2D symbol), with an improvement of 0.9 dB over conventional SSFM and almost 0.4dB over our previously proposed ESSFM. Significant gains and improvements are obtained also at lower complexity. A similar analysis is performed also for longer links, confirming the good performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Receiver-Centric Generative Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates semantic communications between a transmitter and a receiver, where original data, such as videos of interest to the receiver, is stored at the transmitter. Although significant process has been made in semantic communications, a fundamental design problem is that the semantic information is extracted based on certain criteria at the transmitter alone, without considering the receiver's specific information needs. As a result, critical information of primary concern to the receiver may be lost. In such cases, the semantic transmission becomes meaningless to the receiver, as all received information is irrelevant to its interests. To solve this problem, this paper presents a receiver-centric generative semantic communication system, where each transmission is initialized by the receiver. Specifically, the receiver first sends its request for the desired semantic information to the transmitter at the start of each transmission. Then, the transmitter extracts the required semantic information accordingly. A key challenge is how the transmitter understands the receiver's requests for semantic information and extracts the required semantic information in a reasonable and robust manner. We address this challenge by designing a well-structured framework and leveraging off-the-shelf generative AI products, such as GPT-4, along with several specialized tools for detection and estimation. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed new semantic communication system.</description>
