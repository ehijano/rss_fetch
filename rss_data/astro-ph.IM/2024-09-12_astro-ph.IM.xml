      <title>Report of the Kavli-IAU Workshop on Global Coordination, "Probing the Universe from far-infrared to millimeter wavelengths: future facilities and their synergies"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Report summarizes findings and recommendations from the Kavli-IAU workshop on "Probing the Universe from far-infrared to millimeter wavelengths: future facilities and their synergies" which took place from 26 to 28 March 2024 in Pasadena, CA, USA. The workshop aimed to define the needs and potential synergies for different facilities at wavelengths from 30 {\mu}m to a few cm in the post-2030 era, considering both financial and programmatic limitations and exploring how to maximize the scientific insights from the data they will yield in the coming decades.
  This wavelength range provides unique probes of relatively cool, dense interstellar material central to studying the physics and chemistry of nascent stars, proton-planetary disks, and young forming exoplanets. On larger scales, these facilities probe dust and dense gas in galaxies and around highly obscured accreting supermassive black holes and are thus essential for characterizing feedback processes and galaxy evolution out to the highest redshifts. Solar system and time domain studies are also addressed.
  The main recommendations include the need for ALMA to develop an ALMA2040 vision; for ngVLA to maintain its momentum and schedule and further develop international partnerships; for far-IR astronomy to pursue a space-based observatory with urgency; and for large aperture, wide field millimeter/submillimeter telescopes to continue studies to mature science and technology.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of South African Candidate Sites for an Expanded Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global expansion of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) will see the strategic addition of antennas at new geographical locations, transforming the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of the $\lambda \sim 1\,$mm EHT array. A possible South African EHT station would leverage a strong geographical advantage, local infrastructure, and radio astronomy expertise, and have strong synergies with the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia. We assessed three South African candidate millimetre sites using climatological simulations and found at least two promising sites. These sites are comparable to some existing EHT stations during the typical April EHT observing window and outperform them during most of the year, especially the southern hemisphere winter. Interferometric simulations of Africa-enhanced EHT arrays under the simulated atmospheric conditions demonstrate the improved array performance. In typical weather, the number of reliable visibility detections increased considerably, especially at $(u, v)$-distances corresponding to the angular sizes of the Sagittarius A$^*$ and Messier 87$^*$ black hole shadow diameters ($\sim40\,\mathrm{\mu}$as to $50\,\mathrm{\mu}$as). The simulation results underscore the sizable, positive impact of a strategically placed South African EHT station on ngEHT objectives and the resulting black hole science.</description>

      <title>RISTRETTO: a VLT XAO design to reach Proxima Cen b in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RISTRETTO is the evolution of the original idea of coupling the VLT instruments SPHERE and ESPRESSO \cite{lovis_2016a}, aiming at High Dispersion Coronagraphy. RISTRETTO is a visitor instrument that should enable the characterization of the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets in reflected light, by using the technique of high-contrast, high-resolution spectroscopy. Its goal is to observe Prox Cen b and other planets placed at about 35mas from their star, i.e. $2\lambda/D$ at $\lambda$=750nm. The instrument is composed of an extreme adaptive optics, a coronagraphic Integral Field Unit, and a diffraction-limited spectrograph (R=140.000, $\lambda =$620-840 nm).
  We present the RISTRETTO XAO architecture that reach the specification, providing contrasts down to $5\times10^{-5}$ at 2$\lambda/D$ from the star in the visible, in the presence of atmosphere and low wind effect. This performance is allowed by a new two-sensors-one-dm architecture, some variations to the already known concepts of unmodulated pyWFS and zWFS, and exploiting to the maximum of their capabilities the state-of-the-art high speed, low noise cameras \&amp; fast DM. We present the result of end-to-end simulations, that demonstrate stable closed loop operation of an unmodulated pyramid and a zernike WFS (together), and in presence of low wind effect.</description>

      <title>nifty-ls: Fast and Accurate Lomb-Scargle Periodograms Using a Non-Uniform FFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present nifty-ls, a software package for fast and accurate evaluation of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. nifty-ls leverages the fact that Lomb-Scargle can be computed using a non-uniform FFT (NUFFT), which we evaluate with the Flatiron Institute NUFFT package (finufft). This approach achieves a many-fold speedup over the Press &amp; Rybicki (1989) method as implemented in Astropy and is simultaneously many orders of magnitude more accurate. nifty-ls also supports fast evaluation on GPUs via CUDA and integrates with the Astropy Lomb-Scargle interface. nifty-ls is publicly available as open-source software.</description>

      <title>Using Neural Network Models to Estimate Stellar Ages from Lithium Equivalent Widths: An EAGLES Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model of photospheric lithium depletion in cool stars (3000 &lt; Teff / K &lt; 6500), producing estimates and probability distributions of age from Li I 6708A equivalent width (LiEW) and effective temperature data inputs. The model is trained on the same sample of 6200 stars from 52 open clusters, observed in the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey, and used to calibrate the previously published analytical EAGLES model, with ages 2 - 6000 Myr and -0.3 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.2. The additional flexibility of the ANN provides some improvements, including better modelling of the "lithium dip" at ages &lt; 50 Myr and Teff ~ 3500K, and of the intrinsic dispersion in LiEW at all ages. Poor age discrimination is still an issue at ages &gt; 1 Gyr, confirming that additional modelling flexibility is not sufficient to fully represent the LiEW - age - Teff relationship, and suggesting the involvement of further astrophysical parameters. Expansion to include such parameters - rotation, accretion, and surface gravity - is discussed, and the use of an ANN means these can be more easily included in future iterations, alongside more flexible functional forms for the LiEW dispersion. Our methods and ANN model are provided in an updated version 2.0 of the EAGLES software.</description>

      <title>ARA-Next: a new DAQ and trigger architecture for the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment aims to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos (&gt;10 PeV) using radio detection techniques. To enhance ARA's capabilities, a new RFSoC-based DAQ, ARA-Next, is in the early stages of development. This advanced system will facilitate the creation of sophisticated triggers, including a novel multi-trigger approach, similar to those used in collider experiments. Our approach involves crafting and implementing innovative triggers for ARA's new DAQ, such as identifying double pulses from potential in-ice neutrino interactions, utilizing templates for atmospheric cosmic ray signals, optimizing triggers for astrophysical neutrino sources, correlating special events between ARA and IceCube, and discerning anthropogenic events using directional information. These trigger designs aim to lower thresholds and enhance ARA's detector sensitivity. Overall, this upgrade will not only enhance ARA's capabilities but also contribute to the technological advancements necessary for future experiments of this nature.</description>

      <title>First results from a low cost software defined radio system monitoring VHF equatorial ionospheric scintillations in the Indian sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scintillations of radio frequency signals due to the ionosphere, despite having been studied for decades, is still an active area of research. Of particular interest is the scintillations near the geomagnetic equator, where such scintillations can be strong enough to cause disruptions to satellite communications. In this paper, a low cost system to monitor VHF scintillations is described. The system called the Personal Ionospheric Experiment (PIE) makes use of a widely available software defined radio (SDR) to perform the measurements. The use of an SDR vastly enhances the flexibility, especially in environments with non-negligible radio frequency interference (RFI). A simple technique to effectively subtract out transient RFI commonly found in radio data is detailed, and tested with data collected over several months. The utility of the proposed system is demonstrated with the analysis of a night-time scintillation patch; a few daytime scintillations are also reported. Therefore this paper demonstrates the feasibility of conducting useful low-cost radio science experiments in semi-urban locations with RFI, encouraging similar citizen science initiatives.</description>

      <title>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) signals pose significant challenges in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy owing to their low-frequency nature and highly complex waveforms, which occupy a high-dimensional parameter space with numerous variables. Given their extended inspiral timescales and low signal-to-noise ratios, EMRI signals warrant prolonged observation periods. Parameter estimation becomes particularly challenging due to non-local parameter degeneracies, arising from multiple local maxima, as well as flat regions and ridges inherent in the likelihood function. These factors lead to exceptionally high time complexity for parameter analysis while employing traditional matched filtering and random sampling methods. To address these challenges, the present study applies machine learning to Bayesian posterior estimation of EMRI signals, leveraging the recently developed flow matching technique based on ODE neural networks. Our approach demonstrates computational efficiency several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, while preserving the unbiasedness of parameter estimation. We show that machine learning technology has the potential to efficiently handle the vast parameter space, involving up to seventeen parameters, associated with EMRI signals. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first instance of applying machine learning, specifically the Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), to EMRI signal analysis. Our findings highlight the promising potential of machine learning in EMRI waveform analysis, offering new perspectives for the advancement of space-based GW detection and GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>JWST ice band profiles reveal mixed ice compositions in the HH 48 NE disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation is strongly influenced by the composition and distribution of volatiles within protoplanetary disks. With JWST, it is now possible to obtain direct observational constraints on disk ices, as recently demonstrated by the detection of ice absorption features towards the edge-on HH 48 NE disk as part of the Ice Age Early Release Science program. Here, we introduce a new radiative transfer modeling framework designed to retrieve the composition and mixing status of disk ices using their band profiles, and apply it to interpret the H2O, CO2, and CO ice bands observed towards the HH 48 NE disk. We show that the ices are largely present as mixtures, with strong evidence for CO trapping in both H2O and CO2 ice. The HH 48 NE disk ice composition (pure vs. polar vs. apolar fractions) is markedly different from earlier protostellar stages, implying thermal and/or chemical reprocessing during the formation or evolution of the disk. We infer low ice-phase C/O ratios around 0.1 throughout the disk, and also demonstrate that the mixing and entrapment of disk ices can dramatically affect the radial dependence of the C/O ratio. It is therefore imperative that realistic disk ice compositions are considered when comparing planetary compositions with potential formation scenarios, which will fortunately be possible for an increasing number of disks with JWST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Gravity.jl, a new software for the modeling of gravitational lens systems. Gravity.jl is written in the Julia programming language, and is designed to be fast, accurate, and flexible. It can be used to model gravitational lens systems composed of multiple lensing planes, and to perform Bayesian inference on the lens model parameters. In this paper we present the theoretical and statistical ideas behind the code, and we describe its main features. In this first paper of the series, we focus on the modeling of point-like and small extended sources, for which we can linearize the lens equation. We show a practical use of Gravity.jl on a galaxy-scale lens, and we compare the results with those obtained with other codes. We also show how Gravity.jl can be used to perform Bayesian inference on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>NEW-MUSIC: The Next-generation Extended-Wavelength Multiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Next-generation Extended Wavelength-MUltiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC) on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT) will be a first-of-its-kind, six-band, transmillimeter-wave ("trans-mm") polarimeter covering 2.4 octaves of spectral bandwidth to open a new window on the trans-mm time-domain frontier, in particular new frontiers in energy, density, time, and magnetic field. NEW-MUSIC's broad spectral coverage will also enable the use of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to study accretion, feedback, and dust content in the hot gaseous haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Six-band spectral energy distributions, with polarization information, will yield new insights into stellar and planetary nurseries. NEW-MUSIC will employ hierarchical, phased arrays of polarization-sensitive superconducting slot-dipole antennas, coupled to photolithographic bandpass filters, to nearly optimally populate LCT's 14' field-of-view with six spectral bands over 80-420 GHz (1:5.25 spectral dynamic range; 2.4 octaves). Light will be routed to Al or AlMn microstripline-coupled, parallel-plate capacitor, lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (MS-PPC-LEKIDs), an entirely new KID architecture that substantially enhances design flexibility while providing background-limited performance. Innovative, wide-bandwidth, etched silicon structures will be used to antireflection-treat the back-illuminated focal plane. NEW-MUSIC will cost-effectively reuse much of the MUSIC instrument, initially deploying a quarter-scale focal plane capable of the bulk of NEW-MUSIC science followed later by a full-FoV focal plane needed for NEW-MUSIC wide-area survey science.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Dynamical Friction: a Numerical Study of Extended Perturbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of momentum and energy transfer from a massive body moving through a background medium, known as dynamical friction (DF), is key to our understanding of many astrophysical systems. We present a series of high-resolution simulations of gaseous DF using Lagrangian meshless finite mass hydrodynamics solvers in the state-of-the-art multiphysics code Gizmo, the moving-mesh MUSCL scheme in Arepo, and the PPM solver in the Enzo adaptive mesh refinement code. We setup simulations of extended perturbers moving with Mach $0.2 \leq \mathcal{M} \leq 3$ and investigate at which radial distances from the perturber they recover the linear point-mass perturber solutions for the DF drag force, the radial structure of the wake, and their time evolution. The various different solvers agree with each other and we find that the wake structure is recovered, at the $5\%$ level, beyond $r_\mathrm{min}=4r_\mathrm{s}$, with $r_\mathrm{s}$ being the softening scale of the Plummer perturber. The drag force from the gravitationally induced wake is recovered, at this level, beyond this radius. Numerical convergence is reached where the effective initial spatial resolution is $0.2r_s$. This is roughly equivalent to 5 cells per gravitional softening scale in a grid-based code. The value of $r_\mathrm{min}$ provides a natural way to compare different codes and allows us to estimate the difference in DF force that will be experienced. Our results further predict that semianalytic models using the point-mass linear DF estimate from Ostriker (1999) will overestimate the DF forces on the extended perturber by as much as $25\%$, for Mach numbers close to 1. Finally, we show that DF is typically in the linear regime for most subhaloes in hosting haloes $&lt;10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ but non-linear in more massive host haloes.</description>

Abstract: Ongoing deep IFS observations of disk galaxies provide opportunities for comparison with the Milky Way (MW) to understand galaxy evolution. However, such comparisons are marred by many challenges such as selection effects, differences in observations and methodology, and proper validation of full-spectrum fitting methods. In this study, we present a novel code GalCraft to address these challenges by generating mock IFS data cubes of the MW using simple stellar population models and a mock MW stellar catalog derived from E-Galaxia. We use the widely adopted full-spectrum fitting code pPXF to investigate the ability to recover kinematics and stellar populations for an edge-on mock MW IFS observation. We confirm that differences in kinematics, mean age, [M/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] between thin and thick disks can be distinguished. However, the age distribution is overestimated in the ranges between 2 - 4 and 12 - 14 Gyr compared to the expected values. This is likely due to the age spacing and degeneracy of SSP templates. We find systematic offsets in the recovered kinematics due to insufficient spectral resolution and the variation of line-of-sight velocity distribution with age and [M/H]. With future higher resolution and multi-[$\alpha$/Fe] SSP templates, GalCraft will be useful to validate key signatures such as [$\alpha$/Fe]-[M/H] distribution at different $R$ and $|z|$ and potentially infer radial migration and kinematic heating efficiency to study detailed chemodynamical evolution of MW-like galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic monopole is a well-motivated class of beyond-Standard-Model particles that could provide insights into the long-standing puzzle of the quantization of electric charge. These hypothetical particles are likely to be super heavy ($\sim$10$^{15}$ GeV) and be produced in the very early stages of the Universe's evolution. We propose a novel detection scenario for the search of such cosmic magnetic monopoles, utilizing a hybrid approach that combines radio-frequency atomic magnetometers and plastic scintillators. Such setup allows for the collection of both the induction and scintillation signals generated by the passage of a magnetic monopole, which provides acceptance to the magnetic monopoles with their velocities larger than about 10$^{-6}$ light speed (assuming a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$4) and their masses larger than approximately 10$^7$ GeV (at $\beta\sim10^{-3}$). The proposed detector design has the potential to scale up to large area, enabling the exploration of the parameter space of the cosmic magnetic monopole beyond the current experimental and astrophysical constraints. It is estimated that such detector can reach current most stringent limits of the flux set by previous searches, with a signal-to-noise ratio of the induction signal larger than about 4.5, assuming an effective exposure being 20000 year$\cdot$m$^2$ and coil layer of 3.</description>
