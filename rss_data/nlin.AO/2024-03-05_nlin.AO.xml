      <title>Impact of Diffusion on synchronization pattern of epidemics in nonidentical metapopulation networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a prior study, a novel deterministic compartmental model known as the SEIHRK model was introduced, shedding light on the pivotal role of test kits as an intervention strategy for mitigating epidemics. Particularly in heterogeneous networks, it was empirically demonstrated that strategically distributing a limited number of test kits among nodes with higher degrees substantially diminishes the outbreak size. The network's dynamics were explored under varying values of infection rate. In this research, we expand upon these findings to investigate the influence of migration on infection dynamics within distinct communities of the network. Notably, we observe that nodes equipped with test kits and those without tend to segregate into two separate clusters when coupling strength is low, but beyond a critical threshold coupling coefficient, they coalesce into a unified cluster. Building on this clustering phenomenon, we develop a reduced equation model and rigorously validate its accuracy through comprehensive simulations. We show that this property is observed in both complete and random graphs.</description>
