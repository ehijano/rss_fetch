      <title>Early warning signals of the tipping point in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of tipping points is essential for prediction of collapses or other sudden changes in complex systems. Applications include studies of ecology, thermodynamics, climatology, and epidemiology. However, detecting early signs of proximity to a tipping is made challenging by complexity and non-linearity. Strongly interacting Rydberg atom gases offer a model systems that offer both complexity and non-linearity, including phase transition and critical slowing down. Here, via an external probe we observe prior warning of the proximity of a phase transition of Rydberg thermal gases. This warning signal is manifested as a cessation of the variance growth with increasing probe intensity. We also observed the dynamics of the critical slowing down behavior versus different time scales, driving intensities, and atomic densities, thus providing insights into the study of a Rydberg atom system's critical behavior. Our experiment suggests that the full critical slowing down dynamics of strongly-interacting Rydberg atoms can be probed systematically, thus providing a benchmark with which to identify critical phenomena in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Miscibility of Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates with $p$-wave Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a binary mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with competing interspecies $s$- and $p$-wave interactions. Exploiting a pseudopotential model for the $l=1$ partial wave, we derive an extended Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation for the BEC mixture that incorporates both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions. Based on it, we study the miscible-immiscible transition of a binary BEC mixture in the presence of interspecies $p$-wave interaction, by combining numerical solution of the GP equation and Gaussian variational analysis. Our study uncovers a dual effect -- either enhance or reduce miscibility -- of positive interspecies $p$-wave interaction, which can be precisely controlled by adjusting relevant experimental parameters. By complete characterizing the miscibility phase diagram, we establish a promising avenue towards experimental control of the miscibility of binary BEC mixtures via high partial-wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Fast single atom imaging in optical lattice arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and optical tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, which can significantly limit the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 us single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity. Additionally, we resolve lattice sites spaced within the diffraction limit by using accordion lattices to increase the atom spacing before imaging. This overcomes the challenge of imaging small-spacing lattices and enables the study of extended Hubbard models using magnetic atoms. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Fractional Revivals in Elliptical Atomtronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional revivals are recently reported for circular atomtronics, but get disturbed for a nonzero eccentricity of the waveguide geometry. Here, we provide a mechanism for the elliptical atomtronics with arbitrary eccentricity to restore fractional revivals. The uniform ground state of the circular waveguide becomes nonuniform in the elliptical geometry. An appropriate dispersion management can bring back the uniformity and we use the overlap function numerically to identify the corresponding dispersion coefficients, which match our proposed analytical formula. The fact that the cloud spends mostly along the semimajor edges, is demonstrated by the survival function. The said dispersion management recovers the desired fractional revivals patterns, where the revival time-scale becomes independent of the eccentricity. The present method paves the way also to observe other known phenomena of circular atomtronics in elliptical atomtronics.</description>

      <title>Connecting shear-flow and vortex array instabilities in annular atomic superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the interface between two fluid layers in relative motion, infinitesimal fluctuations can be exponentially amplified, inducing vorticity and the breakdown of the laminar flow. This process, known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, is responsible for many familiar phenomena observed in the atmosphere and in the oceans, as well as in astrophysical objects, being known as one of the paradigmatic routes to turbulence in fluid mechanics. While shear-flow instabilities in classical fluids have been extensively observed in various contexts, controlled experiments in the presence of quantized circulation are comparatively very few. Here, we engineer two counter-rotating atomic superflows, a configuration that in classical inviscid fluids is unstable via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We observe how the contact interface, i.e. the shear layer, develops into an ordered circular array of quantized vortices, which loses stability and rolls up into vortex clusters. We extract the instability growth rates and find that they obey the same scaling relations across different superfluid regimes, ranging from weakly-interacting bosonic to strongly-correlated fermionic pair condensates. The measured scalings, reproduced by numerical simulations and well described by a microscopic point-vortex model, are consistent with the classical hydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of a finite-width shear layer. Our results establish interesting connections between vortex arrays and shear-flow instabilities, suggesting a possible interpretation of the observed quantized vortex dynamics as a manifestation of the underlying unstable flow. Moreover, they open the way for exploring a wealth of out-of-equilibrium phenomena, from vortex-matter phase transitions to the spontaneous emergence and decay of two-dimensional quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics of driven Bose-Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral statistics of a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model subjected to kinetic driving; a form of Floquet engineering where the kinetic energy is periodically driven in time with a zero time-average. As the amplitude of the driving is increased, the ground state of the resulting flat-band system passes from the Mott insulator regime to an exotic superfluid. We show that this transition is associated with a change in the system's spectral statistics from Poisson to GOE-type. Remarkably, and unlike in the conventional Bose-Hubbard model, which we use as a benchmark, the details of the GOE statistics are sensitive to the parity of both the particle number and the lattice sites. We show how this effect arises from a hidden symmetry of the Hamiltonian produced by this form of Floquet driving.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent-carrying supersolid in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of brilliant achievements in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates is the discovery and observation of the supersolid stripe states. So far, all studied supersolid stripe states do not carry supercurrent. In this work, we reveal the existence of supercurrent-carrying supersolids in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. The supersolid family has a parabolic-like dispersion relation and carries supercurrent which is proportional to the quasimomentum. Energetic and dynamical instabilities can break supercurrent-carrying ability of this supersolid family. An insightful interpretation of the dynamical instability of supercurrent-carrying supersolids from the pure plane-wave phase is provided.</description>

      <title>Edge theory of non-Hermitian skin modes in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an effective edge theory to characterize non-Hermitian edge-skin modes in higher dimensions. We begin by proposing a bulk projection criterion to straightforwardly identify the localized edges of skin modes. Through an exact mapping, we show that the edge-skin mode shares the same bulk-boundary correspondence and localization characteristics as the zero-energy edge states in a Hermitian semimetal under open-boundary conditions, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian edge-skin effect and Hermitian semimetals. Another key finding is the introduction of ``skewness,'' a term we proposed to describe the characteristic decay direction of skin mode from the localized edge into the bulk. Remarkably, we demonstrate that skewness is an intrinsic quantity of the skin mode and can be analytically determined using the corresponding cylinder-geometry bulk Hamiltonian, without requiring any boundary details. Furthermore, we reveal that in the edge-skin effect, the spectrum exhibits anomalous spectral sensitivity to weak local disturbances, a feature that crucially distinguishes it from the corner-skin effect.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and anomalies of Kitaev spin-$S$ models: Identifying symmetry-enforced exotic quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the internal symmetries and their anomalies in the Kitaev spin-$S$ models. Importantly, these models have a lattice version of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$. There is also an ordinary 0-form $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}$ are $\pi$ spin rotations around two orthogonal axes, and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ is the time reversal symmetry. The anomalies associated with the full $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$ symmetry are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{17}$. We find that for $S\in\mathbb{Z}$ the model is anomaly-free, while for $S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$ there is an anomaly purely associated with the 1-form symmetry, but there is no anomaly purely associated with the ordinary symmetry or mixed anomaly between the 0-form and 1-form symmetries. The consequences of these symmetries and anomalies apply to not only the Kitaev spin-$S$ models, but also any of their perturbed versions, assuming that the perturbations are local and respect the symmetries. If these local perturbations are weak, generically these consequences still apply even if the perturbations break the 1-form symmetry. A notable consequence is that there should generically be a deconfined fermionic excitation carrying no fractional quantum number under the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry if $S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$, which implies symmetry-enforced exotic quantum matter. We also discuss the consequences for $S\in\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Mass Ratio Dependence of Three-Body Resonance Lifetimes in 1D and 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of resonance lifetimes in a two-component three-body system, specifically examining the decay of three-body resonances into a deep dimer and an unbound particle. Utilising the Gaussian expansion method together with the complex scaling method, we obtain the widths of these resonances from first principles. We focus on mass ratios in the typical range for mixtures of ultracold atoms and reveal an intriguing dependence of the resonance widths on the mass ratio: as the mass ratio increases, the widths exhibit oscillations on top of an overall decreasing trend. In particular, for some mass ratios the resonance width vanishes, implying that the resonance becomes in fact stable. Notably, near the mass ratio for Caesium-Lithium mixtures, we obtain nearly vanishing widths of the resonances which validates to treat them in the bound-state approximation. In addition, we perform our analysis of the resonance widths in both one and three dimensions and find a qualitatively similar dependence on the mass ratio.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Calculations of Nonlinear Susceptibility and Multi-Phonon Mixing Processes in a 2DEG-Piezoelectric Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>
