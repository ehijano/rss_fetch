      <title>A Locally Robust Semiparametric Approach to Examiner IV Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a locally robust semiparametric framework for estimating causal effects using the popular examiner IV design, in the presence of many examiners and possibly many covariates relative to the sample size. The key ingredient of this approach is an orthogonal moment function that is robust to biases and local misspecification from the first step estimation of the examiner IV. I derive the orthogonal moment function and show that it delivers multiple robustness where the outcome model or at least one of the first step components is misspecified but the estimating equation remains valid. The proposed framework not only allows for estimation of the examiner IV in the presence of many examiners and many covariates relative to sample size, using a wide range of nonparametric and machine learning techniques including LASSO, Dantzig, neural networks and random forests, but also delivers root-n consistent estimation of the parameter of interest under mild assumptions.</description>

      <title>Identification by non-Gaussianity in structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear structural vector autoregressive models can be identified statistically without imposing restrictions on the model if the shocks are mutually independent and at most one of them is Gaussian. We show that this result extends to structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models incorporating a time-varying impact matrix defined as a weighted sum of the impact matrices of the regimes. Our empirical application studies the effects of the climate policy uncertainty shock on the U.S. macroeconomy. In a structural logistic smooth transition vector autoregressive model consisting of two regimes, we find that a positive climate policy uncertainty shock decreases production in times of low economic policy uncertainty but slightly increases it in times of high economic policy uncertainty. The introduced methods are implemented to the accompanying R package sstvars.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Bootstrap: Efficient Simulation of Input Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bootstrap is a popular methodology for simulating input uncertainty. However, it can be computationally expensive when the number of samples is large. We propose a new approach called \textbf{Orthogonal Bootstrap} that reduces the number of required Monte Carlo replications. We decomposes the target being simulated into two parts: the \textit{non-orthogonal part} which has a closed-form result known as Infinitesimal Jackknife and the \textit{orthogonal part} which is easier to be simulated. We theoretically and numerically show that Orthogonal Bootstrap significantly reduces the computational cost of Bootstrap while improving empirical accuracy and maintaining the same width of the constructed interval.</description>

      <title>Percentage Coefficient (bp) -- Effect Size Analysis (Theory Paper 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Percentage coefficient (bp) has emerged in recent publications as an additional and alternative estimator of effect size for regression analysis. This paper retraces the theory behind the estimator. It's posited that an estimator must first serve the fundamental function of enabling researchers and readers to comprehend an estimand, the target of estimation. It may then serve the instrumental function of enabling researchers and readers to compare two or more estimands. Defined as the regression coefficient when dependent variable (DV) and independent variable (IV) are both on conceptual 0-1 percentage scales, percentage coefficients (bp) feature 1) clearly comprehendible interpretation and 2) equitable scales for comparison. Thus, the coefficient (bp) serves both functions effectively and efficiently, thereby serving some needs not completely served by other indicators such as raw coefficient (bw) and standardized beta. Another fundamental premise of the functionalist theory is that "effect" is not a monolithic concept. Rather, it is a collection of compartments, each of which measures a component of the conglomerate that we call "effect." A regression coefficient (b), for example, measures one aspect of effect, which is unit effect, aka efficiency, as it indicates the unit change in DV associated with a one-unit increase in IV. Percentage coefficient (bp) indicates the change in DV in percentage points associated with a whole scale increase in IV. It is meant to be an all-encompassing indicator of the all-encompassing concept of effect, but rather an interpretable and comparable indicator of efficiency, one of the key components of effect.</description>

      <title>Testing for Nonlinear Cointegration under Heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article discusses tests for nonlinear cointegration in the presence of variance breaks. We build on cointegration test approaches under heteroskedasticity (Cavaliere and Taylor, 2006, Journal of Time Series Analysis) and nonlinearity (Choi and Saikkonen, 2010, Econometric Theory) to propose a bootstrap test and prove its consistency. A Monte Carlo study shows the approach to have satisfactory finite-sample properties. We provide an empirical application to the environmental Kuznets curves (EKC), finding that the cointegration test provides little evidence for the EKC hypothesis. Additionally, we examine a nonlinear relation between the US money demand and the interest rate, finding that our test does not reject the null of a smooth transition cointegrating relation.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Inference in Incomplete Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose confidence regions for the parameters of incomplete models with exact coverage of the true parameter in finite samples. Our confidence region inverts a test, which generalizes Monte Carlo tests to incomplete models. The test statistic is a discrete analogue of a new optimal transport characterization of the sharp identified region. Both test statistic and critical values rely on simulation drawn from the distribution of latent variables and are computed using solutions to discrete optimal transport, hence linear programming problems. We also propose a fast preliminary search in the parameter space with an alternative, more conservative yet consistent test, based on a parameter free critical value.</description>

      <title>Estimating Causal Effects with Double Machine Learning -- A Method Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of causal effects with observational data continues to be a very active research area. In recent years, researchers have developed new frameworks which use machine learning to relax classical assumptions necessary for the estimation of causal effects. In this paper, we review one of the most prominent methods - "double/debiased machine learning" (DML) - and empirically evaluate it by comparing its performance on simulated data relative to more traditional statistical methods, before applying it to real-world data. Our findings indicate that the application of a suitably flexible machine learning algorithm within DML improves the adjustment for various nonlinear confounding relationships. This advantage enables a departure from traditional functional form assumptions typically necessary in causal effect estimation. However, we demonstrate that the method continues to critically depend on standard assumptions about causal structure and identification. When estimating the effects of air pollution on housing prices in our application, we find that DML estimates are consistently larger than estimates of less flexible methods. From our overall results, we provide actionable recommendations for specific choices researchers must make when applying DML in practice.</description>
