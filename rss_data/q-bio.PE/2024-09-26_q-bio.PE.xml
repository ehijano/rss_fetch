      <title>A Kermack--McKendrick type epidemic model with double threshold phenomenon (and a possible application to Covid-19)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suggestion by K.L. Cooke (1967) that infected individuals become infective if they are exposed often enough for a natural disease resistance to be overcome is built into a Kermack-McKendrick type epidemic model with infectivity age. Both the case that the resistance may be the same for all hosts and the case that it is distributed among the host population are considered. In addition to the familiar threshold behavior of the final size of the epidemic with respect to a basic reproductive number, an Allee effect is generated with respect to the final cumulative force of infection exerted by the initial infectives. This offers a deterministic explanation of why geographic areas that appear to be epidemiologically similar have epidemic outbreaks of quite different severity.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic reaction networks with entropic control cost and emergence of mode-switching strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both the dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing a control cost function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This approach naturally accounts for population-specific factors and simplifies the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.</description>

      <title>Group-Based Phylogenetic Models on 3-Sunlet Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks describe the evolution of a set of taxa for which reticulate events have occurred at some point in their evolutionary history. Of particular interest is when the evolutionary history between a set of just three taxa has a reticulate event. In molecular phylogenetics, substitution models can model the process of evolution at the genetic level, and the case of three taxa with a reticulate event can be modelled using a substitution model on a mixed graph called a 3-sunlet. We investigate a class of substitution models called group-based phylogenetic models on 3-sunlet networks. In particular, we investigate the discrete geometry of the parameter space and how this relates to the dimension of the phylogenetic variety associated to the model. This enables us to give a dimension formula for this variety for general group-based models when the order of the group is odd.</description>

      <title>A 2-approximation algorithm for the softwired parsimony problem on binary, tree-child phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the most parsimonious tree inside a phylogenetic network with respect to a given character is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that for many network topologies is essentially inapproximable. In contrast, if the network is a rooted tree, then Fitch's well-known algorithm calculates an optimal parsimony score for that character in polynomial time. Drawing inspiration from this we here introduce a new extension of Fitch's algorithm which runs in polynomial time and ensures an approximation factor of 2 on binary, tree-child phylogenetic networks, a popular topologically-restricted subclass of phylogenetic networks in the literature. Specifically, we show that Fitch's algorithm can be seen as a primal-dual algorithm, how it can be extended to binary, tree-child networks and that the approximation guarantee of this extension is tight. These results for a classic problem in phylogenetics strengthens the link between polyhedral methods and phylogenetics and can aid in the study of other related optimization problems on phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>How Combined Pairwise and Higher-Order Interactions Shape Transient Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09521</link>

Abstract: Understanding how species interactions shape biodiversity is a core challenge in ecology. While much focus has been on long-term stability, there is rising interest in transient dynamics-the short-lived periods when ecosystems respond to disturbances and adjust toward stability. These transitions are crucial for predicting ecosystem reactions and guiding effective conservation. Our study introduces a model that uses convex combinations to blend pairwise and higher-order interactions, offering a more realistic view of natural ecosystems. We find pairwise interactions slow the journey to stability, while higher-order interactions speed it up. Employing global stability analysis and numerical simulations, we establish that as the proportion of higher-order interactions (HOIs) increases, mean transient times exhibit a significant reduction, thereby underscoring the essential role of HOIs in enhancing biodiversity stabilization. Our results reveal a robust correlation between the most negative real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix associated with the linearized system at the coexistence equilibrium and the mean transient times. This indicates that a more negative leading eigenvalue correlates with accelerated convergence to stable coexistence abundances. This insight is vital for comprehending ecosystem resilience and recovery, emphasizing the key role of HOIs in promoting stabilization. Amid growing interest in transient dynamics and its implications for biodiversity and ecological stability, our study enhances the understanding of how species interactions affect both transient and long-term ecosystem behavior. By addressing a critical gap in ecological theory and offering a practical framework for ecosystem management, our work advances knowledge of transient dynamics, ultimately informing effective conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.
