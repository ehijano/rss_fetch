      <title>Environmental Factors Can Have Opposite Biodiversity Influences on the Community Temporal Stability In Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1. An understanding of how biodiversity confers ecosystem stability is crucial in managing ecosystems under major environmental changes. Multiple biodiversity drivers can stabilize ecosystem functions over time. However, we know little about how local environmental conditions can influence these biodiversity drivers, and consequently how they indirectly shape the ecological stability of ecosystems.
  2. We hypothesized that environmental factors can have opposite influences (i.e., not necessarily either positive or negative) on the temporal stability of communities in different environmental ranges depending on the biodiversity drivers involved. We tested this novel hypothesis by using data from a 4-year-long field study of submerged macrophyte across a water depth gradient in 8 heterogeneous bays of Erhai lake (with total sample size of 30,071 quadrats), a large lentic system in China.
  3. Results indicate that a unimodal pattern of stability in temporal biomass measurements occurred along the water-depth gradient, and that multiple biodiversity drivers (the asynchrony in species dynamics, and the stability of dominant species) generally increased the temporal stability of aquatic primary producers. However, the effect of water depth either increased or decreased the stability of biomass according to the environmental conditions associated with sites along the water depth gradient.
  4. Synthesis. These results reveal the influence of local environmental conditions on the biodiversity drivers of stability may help predict the functional consequences of biodiversity change across different scenarios of environmental change.</description>

      <title>Modeling COVID-19 spread in the USA using metapopulation SIR models coupled with graph convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown tremendous promise in addressing data-intensive challenges in recent years. In particular, some attempts have been made to improve predictions of Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models by incorporating human mobility between metapopulations and using graph approaches to estimate corresponding hyperparameters. Recently, researchers have found that a hybrid GCN-SIR approach outperformed existing methodologies when used on the data collected on a precinct level in Japan. In our work, we extend this approach to data collected from the continental US, adjusting for the differing mobility patterns and varying policy responses. We also develop the strategy for real-time continuous estimation of the reproduction number and study the accuracy of model predictions for the overall population as well as individual states. Strengths and limitations of the GCN-SIR approach are discussed as a potential candidate for modeling disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Life uses non-equilibrium mechanisms to create ordered structures not attainable at equilibrium; the resulting order is assumed to provide functional benefits that outweigh costs of time and energy needed by these mechanisms. Here, we show that models of DNA replication and self-assembly, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve error correcting mechanisms like kinetic proofreading and dynamic instability through selection for fast replication alone. We abstract these results into a general framework that predicts a counterintuitive ''order through speed'' effect if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. We test our results against recent mutational screens of proofreading polymerases. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can evolve even before that order is directly functional, with consequences for the evolution of mutation rates, viral capsid assembly, and the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>
