      <title>An integration-free method for calculating curl and divergence in space plasmas using multi-spacecraft data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knowledge of local spatial gradients (curl, divergence etc.) is crucial to examine the three-dimensional variation of flow fields including velocity and magnetic fields in space plasmas like the solar wind. Here we propose a simple method to calculate the same using the in-situ data of multi-spacecraft systems. Unlike the popular Curlometer method which depends on the vector integration theorems, our integration-free method is based on the construction of a local orthonormal coordinate system and the associated finite difference approximations. The Curlometer is applicable to a four spacecraft system arranged in a tetrahedron and yields a single volume-averaged estimate of the curl. Using our proposed method over 107 intervals of MMS (NASA) data, on the other hand, we successfully calculate the spatial derivatives at the position of each spacecraft of the tetrahedron and a three-spacecraft (non-collinear) subset of the same. The average value of all the curls calculated for a given tetrahedron shows an excellent agreement (correlation coeffcient ~ 0:99) with the curls calculated using Curlometer formula. The quality of the calculated curl (using our method) is found to improve if the spacecraft configuration approaches a regular tetrahedron. The current framework facilitates investigation of turbulent heating rates and the exploration of local flow features like Beltramization, existence of current sheets, etc., in present and future multi-spacecraft mission, including those involving more than four spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Self-organization of local streamline structures and energy transfer rate in compressible plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine how local streamline topology and energy cascade rate self-organize in plasma turbulence for both compressible and incompressible regimes. Using a fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we quantify the subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures by means of grandient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field. Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\nabla\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).</description>
