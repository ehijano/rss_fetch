      <title>A VLBI Calibration System with Real-time Pulsar Gating for FRB Localization using CHIME/FRB Outriggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several thousand fast radio burst (FRB) sources have been discovered using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope, as part of the CHIME/FRB project. Currently, CHIME/FRB is able to localize most FRBs to a limiting precision of several arcminutes, which can be improved to subarcminute precision for some FRB sources through offline analysis of their baseband data. This allows only the most nearby sources to be robustly associated with a host galaxy. Using three new Outrigger telescopes located at transcontinental distances from CHIME, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will improve the localization capabilities of CHIME/FRB. Together, these radio telescopes will form a wide field of view, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array that will enable FRBs discovered by CHIME/FRB to be localized to a limiting precision of ~50 milliarcseconds. The astrometric position of each FRB will be determined using calibration solutions derived from well-localized radio pulsars and compact, steady radio sources. We present an overview of the VLBI calibration system that will be employed within the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project to achieve high precision FRB localizations, which will enable studies of a large number of FRB host galaxies and local environments.</description>

      <title>Uncovering deterministic behavior of black hole IGR J17091-3624: A twin of GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nonlinear properties in accreting systems, particularly for black holes, from observation is illuminating as they are expected to be general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic flows that are nonlinear. Two features associated with nonlinear systems, used commonly, are chaos, which is deterministic, and random, which is stochastic. The differentiation between chaotic and stochastic systems is often considered to quantify the nonlinear properties of an astrophysical system. The particular emphasis is that data is often noise-contaminated and finite. We examine the dual nature of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624, whose behavior has been closely studied in parallel to GRS 1915+105. Certain similarities in the temporal classes of these two objects are explored in literature. However, this has not been the case with their non-linear dynamics: GRS 1915+105 shows signs of determinism and stochasticity both, while IGR J17091-3624 was found to be predominantly stochastic. Here, we confront the inherent challenge of noise contamination faced by previous studies, particularly Poisson noise, which adversely impacts the reliability of non-linear results. We employ several denoising techniques to mitigate noise effects and employ methods like Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition, and Correlation Integral to isolate the deterministic signatures. We have found signs of determinism in IGR J17091-3624, thus supporting the hypothesis of it being similar to GRS 1915+105, even as a dynamical system. Our findings not only shed light on the complex nature of IGR J17091-3624, but also pave the way for future research employing noise-reduction techniques to analyze non-linearity in observed dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Bandwidth Measurements from 23 Pulsars from the AO327 Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pulsar's scintillation bandwidth is inversely proportional to the scattering delay, making accurate measurements of scintillation bandwidth critical to characterize unmitigated delays in efforts to measure low-frequency gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. In this pilot work, we searched for a subset of known pulsars within $\sim$97% of the data taken with the PUPPI instrument for the AO327 survey with the Arecibo telescope, attempting to measure the scintillation bandwidths in the dataset by fitting to the 2D autocorrelation function of their dynamic spectra. We successfully measured 38 bandwidths from 23 pulsars (six without prior literature values), finding that: almost all of the measurements are larger than the predictions from NE2001 and YMW16 (two popular galactic models); NE2001 is more consistent with our measurements than YMW16; Gaussian fits to the bandwidth are more consistent with both electron density models than Lorentzian ones; and for the 17 pulsars with prior literature values, the measurements between various sources often vary by factors of a few. The success of Gaussian fits may be due to the use of Gaussian fits to train models in previous work. The variance of literature values over time could relate to the scaling factor used to compare measurements, but also seems consistent with time-varying interstellar medium parameters. This work can be extended to the rest of AO327 to further investigate these trends, highlighting the continuing importance of large archival datasets for projects beyond their initial conception.</description>

      <title>The transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays: the high-energy end of the Galactic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays (CRs) is essential to make sense of the Local cosmic ray spectrum. Several models have been proposed to account for this transition in the 0.1 - 10 $\times 10^{18}$ eV range. For instance: ankle models, where the change from a steep Galactic component to a hard extragalactic spectrum occurs in the $4-10 \times 10^{18}$ eV region, dip models, where the interactions of CR protons with the CMB producing electron-positron pairs shape the ankle, or mixed composition models, in which extragalactic CRs are composed of nuclei of various types.
  In all these scenarios, the low-energy part of the transition involves the high-energy part of the Galactic component. Therefore, any information on the Galactic component, such as maximum energy, chemical composition, and spectrum after propagation, is crucial to understanding the Galactic-extragalactic transition. We briefly review the high-energy part of the CR spectrum expected from the best potential sources of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Models of Black Hole Photon Rings from Low-Luminosity Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images of black holes encode both astrophysical and gravitational properties. Detecting highly-lensed features in images can differentiate between these two effects. We present an accretion disk emission model coupled to the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code that allows a fast parameter space exploration of black hole photon ring images produced from synchrotron emission from 10 to 670 GHz. As an application, we systematically study several disk models and compute their total flux, photon ring radii, and optical depth. The model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*. For the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between optically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon ring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of photon ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models, the highly lensed photon ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that at low frequencies, the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while at higher frequencies, the magnetic field strength plays a more significant role, demonstrating how multi-frequency analysis can also be used to infer plasma parameters. Lastly, we show how our implementation can qualitatively reproduce multifrequency black hole images from GRMHD simulations when adding time-variability to our disk model through Gaussian random fields. This approach provides a new method for simulating observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space mission.</description>

      <title>Exclusion of a direct progenitor detection for the Type Ic SN 2017ein based on late-time observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($&gt;$45 $M_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.</description>

      <title>Identifying dark matter signals by the radio continuum spectral data of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the signals of dark matter annihilation is one of the most popular ways to understand the nature of dark matter. In particular, many recent studies are focussing on using radio data to examine the possible signals of dark matter revealed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. In this article, we investigate on the spectral data of the central radio halo of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638. We show that the radio spectral data can be best accounted by the synchrotron emission due to dark matter annihilation via $\tau$ lepton channel (with dark matter mass $m=15$ GeV) or $b$ quark channel (with dark matter mass $m=110$ GeV), although using the very coarse spectral data with notable errors. Despite the fact that cosmic-ray emission can also provide a good explanation for the observed radio spectrum, our results suggest a possible positive evidence for dark matter annihilation revealed in the form of radio emission in RX J1720.1+2638 cluster.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- III: Long term evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. QPEs have shown to be invaluable in probing the orbits of SMOs in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this paper, we extend previous orbital analyses in Refs. arXiv:2401.11190, arXiv:2405.06429 by including extra effects, the SMO orbital decay due to collisions with the disk and the disk precession. We find clear Bayes evidence for orbital decay in GSN 069 and for disk precession in eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources. The detection of these effects provides informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. With tighter constraints on the SMO orbital parameters, we further confirm that these two QPE EMRIs are nearly circular orbiters which are consistent with the wet EMRI formation channel prediction, but are incompatible with either the dry loss-cone channel or the Hills mechanism. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.</description>

      <title>A new method for studying the blazar variability on the shortest time scales and its application to S5 1803+784</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for investigating the evolution of the properties of the blazar brightness variability on timescales from a few hours to a few days. Its essence lies in detecting sequentially located time intervals along the entire light curve, within which it is possible to determine the characteristic time of variability using the structure function. We applied this method to a uniform data series lasting several days provided by the TESS mission for blazar S5 1803+784. Then, we analyzed the found time parameters of variability coupled with the data of B-, V-, R-, and I-photometric observations. A correlation was found between the amplitude and the characteristic time of variability. The relation of these values with the spectral index of radiation has not been revealed. We conclude that the variability on a short time scale is formed due to the different Doppler factors for having different volume parts of the optical emitting region. At the same time, the radiation spectrum deflects slightly from the power-law.</description>

      <title>Timing analysis of rotating radio transients discovered with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit pulses of radiation at regular intervals, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The precise recording and modelling of the arrival times of pulsar emission is known as timing analysis. Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are a subclass of pulsars that emit pulses very sporadically. Because of the sparse pulse times of arrival (ToAs) typically available for these sources, they are much more difficult to time than regular pulsars, to the extent that few RRATs currently have coherent timing solutions. In this work, we present the results of timing analyses for four RRATs discovered by the MeerTRAP transient survey using MeerKAT. We incorporated additional pulse ToAs from each source that have been detected since their original analysis. We confirmed the known timing solution for PSR J1843$-$0757, with a period of $P=2.03$ seconds, and a period derivative of $\dot{P}=4,13\times10^{-15}$. However, our analysis did not comport with the solution of MTP0005, which we conclude may have been mistakenly identified with the known PSR J1840$-$0815 in the original analysis. Finally, the spin period for MTP0007 was determined to be $1.023(1)$ seconds using a brute-force period fitting approach.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival HST data and eruption properties with stellar and novae models, to comprise a 0.65 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ primary white dwarf and a K III cool giant secondary star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a timing study of the gamma and X-ray observations and analysis of a sample of bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; i.e. GRB 180720B, GRB 181222B, GRB 211211A and GRB 220910A), including the very bright and long GRB 211211A (a.k.a. kilonova candidate). They have been detected and observed by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on-board the Fermi mission. The early (T-T0=s) and high-energy (0.3-20 MeV) ASIM High Energy Detector (HED) and (150 keV-30 GeV) Fermi (BGO) light curves show well-defined peaks with a low quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency between 2.5-3.5 Hz that could be identified with the spin of the neutron star in the binary mergers (coinciding with the orbital frequency of the binary merger) originating these GRBs. These QPOs consist on the first detection of low-frequency QPOs (&lt;10 Hz) detected in magnetars so far. We also detect a strong QPO at 21.8-22 Hz in GRB 181222B together with its (less significant) harmonics. The low-frequency QPO would correspond to the signal of the orbiting neutron star (NS) previous to the final coalescence giving rise to the gravitational-wave (GW) signal.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Flux Transport in Advection Dominated Accretion Flow Towards the Formation of Magnetically Arrested Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetically arrested disks (MADs) have attracted much attention in recent years. The formation of MADs are usually attributed to the accumulation of a sufficient amount of dynamically significant poloidal magnetic flux. In this work, the magnetic flux transport within an advection dominated accretion flow and the formation of a MAD are investigated. The structure and dynamics of an inner MAD connected with an outer ADAF are derived by solving a set of differential equations with suitable boundary conditions. We find that an inner MAD disk is eventually formed at a region about several ten Schwarzschild radius outside the horizon. Due to the presence of strong large-scale magnetic field, the radial velocity of the accretion flow is significantly decreased. The angular velocity of the MAD region is highly subkeplerian with $\Omega \sim (0.4-0.5)\Omega_{\rm K}$ and the corresponding ratio of gas to magnetic pressure is about $\beta \lesssim 1$. Also, we find that MAD is unlikely to be formed through the inward flux advection process when the external magnetic field strength weak enough with $\beta_{\rm out}\gtrsim 100$ around $R_{\rm out}\sim 1000R_{\rm s}$. Based on the rough estimate, we find that the jet power of a black hole, with mass $M_{\rm BH}$ and spin $a_*$, surrounded by an ADAF with inner MAD region is about two order of magnitude larger than that of a black hole surrounded by a normal ADAF. This may account for the powerful jets observed in some Fanaroff Riley type I galaxies with a very low Eddington ratio.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization from accretion disk winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry is a fine tool to probe the accretion geometry and physical processes operating in the proximity of compact objects, black holes and neutron stars. Recent discoveries made by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer put our understanding of the accretion picture in question. The observed high levels of X-ray polarization in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei are challenging to achieve within the conventional scenarios. In this work we investigate a possibility that a fraction (or even all) of the observed polarized signal arises from scattering in the equatorial accretion disk winds, the slow and extended outflows, which are often detected in these systems via spectroscopic means. We find that the wind scattering can reproduce the levels of polarization observed in these sources.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon: The 1CGH Catalogue of Fermi-LAT detections above 10 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi-LAT satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified about 2900 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, including 69 reported here for the first time. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of about 500 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3.0. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources for understanding the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be effectively measured using Fermi-LAT data.</description>

      <title>A new potential method for the $X_{\rm max}$ measurement of extensive air showers based on backtracking radio signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}</description>

      <title>Accretion Disk-Outflow/Jet and Hard State ULXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have been objects of great interest for the past few decades due to their unusually high luminosities and spectral properties. A few of these sources exhibit super-Eddington luminosities assuming them to be centering around stellar mass objects, even in their hard state. It has been shown via numerical steady state calculations that ULXs in hard state can be interpreted as highly magnetised advective accretion sources around stellar mass black holes. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) framework to simulate highly magnetised advective accretion flows around a black hole and show that such systems can indeed produce high luminosities like ULXs. We also verify that the magnetic fields required for such high emissions is around $10^7$ G, in accordance with previous numerical steady state calculations. We further present power profiles for zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO) frame. These profiles show interesting features which can be interpreted as effects of emission due to the Blandford-Znajek and Blandford-Payne mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested advective accretion flows and jets/outflows around stellar mass black holes: Explaining hard state ULXs with GRMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optically thin advective accretion disk is crucial for explaining the hard state of black hole sources. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we investigate how a large-scale, strong magnetic field influences accretion and outflows/jets, depending on the field geometry, magnetic field strength, and the spin parameter of the black hole. We simulate a sub-Eddington, advective disk-outflow system in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which likely remains in the hard state. The model simulations based on HARMPI successfully explain ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in the hard state, typically observed with luminosities ranging from $10^{39}$ - $10^{40}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our simulations generally describe the bright, hard state of stellar-mass black hole sources without requiring a super-Eddington accretion rate. This work explores the characteristics of ULXs without invoking intermediate-mass black holes. The observed high luminosity is attributed to the energy stored in the strong magnetic fields, which can generate super-Eddington luminosity. The combined energy of the matter and magnetic field leads to such significant luminosity.</description>

      <title>Tidal Resonance in Binary Neutron Star Inspirals: A High-Precision Study in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal resonance of the fundamental ($f$-)mode in spinning neutron stars, robustly tracing the onset of the excitation to its saturation, using numerical relativity for the first time. We performed long-term ($\approx15$~orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the $f$-mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasi-circular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The $f$-mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of $\gtrsim6.3\%$ in the linear regime and much more as $\sim33\%$ during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of $\lesssim40$~radians is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the same satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes (f-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields. Some of them (soft-gamma repeaters, SGRs) demonstrate gigantic flares which nature is still unclear. At decay phase of such flares one often observes quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) which are treated as stellar oscillations triggered by the flares. We study, for the first time, magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars possessing toroidal magnetic fields confined in the stellar crust, without imposing axial symmetry of perturbations. We show that the Zeeman effect makes the oscillation spectrum much richer than for axially symmetric oscillations. The main properties of theoretical QPO spectra are discussed as well as their potential to interpret observations and explore magnetar physics.</description>

      <title>High density symmetry energy: A key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>Energetic Explosions from Collisions of Stars at Relativistic Speeds in Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider collisions occurring between stars moving near the speed of light around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $M_{\bullet}\gtrsim10^8\,M_\odot$, without being tidally disrupted. In this SMBH range, for sun-like stars, the tidal-disruption radius is smaller than the SMBH's event horizon; therefore we do not expect to observe tidal disruption events. Differential collision rates are calculated by defining probability distribution functions for various parameters such as the impact parameter, distance from SMBH at time of collision, relative velocity between the two colliding stars, and the masses of the two colliding stars. The relative velocity parameter is drawn from a distribution function for SMBHs. We integrate over all parameters to arrive at a total collision rate for a galaxy with a specific SMBH mass. We then consider how the stellar population in the vicinity of the SMBH is depleted and replenished over time, and calculate the effect on the collision rate over time. We calculate the differential collision rate as a function of total energy released, energy released per unit mass lost, and galactocentric radius. The overall rate for collisions taking place in the inner $\sim1$ pc of galaxies with $M_{\bullet}=10^8,10^9,10^{10}\,M_\odot$ are $\Gamma\sim2.2\times10^{-3},2.2\times10^{-4},4.7\times10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The most common collisions release energies on the order of $\sim10^{49}-10^{51}$ erg, with the energy distribution peaking at higher energies in galaxies with more massive SMBHs. In addition, we show example light curves for collisions with varying parameters, and find that the peak luminosity could reach or even exceed that of superluminous supernovae. Weaker events could initially be mistaken for low-luminosity supernovae.</description>

Abstract: The precise origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain unknown. Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources can provide important insights into the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. Here, we present results from a sensitive, broadband X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source (located 3.63 Mpc away in an ~10-Gyr-old globular cluster). We place deep limits on the persistent and prompt X-ray emission from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible origins for the source. We compare our results with various classes of X-ray sources, transients, and FRB models. We find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with ultraluminous X-ray bursts, magnetar-like giant flares, or an SGR 1935+2154-like intermediate flare. Although other types of bright magnetar-like intermediate flares and short X-ray bursts would have been detectable from FRB 20200120E during our observations, we cannot entirely rule them out as a class. We show that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be powered by an ultraluminous X-ray source or a young extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries. These results highlight the power of multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs for discriminating between FRB models.</description>

      <title>Case for Centaurus A as the main source of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that a dominant fraction of the cosmic rays above the ankle is due to a single nearby source, considering in particular the radio galaxy Centaurus A. We focus on the properties of the source spectrum and composition required to reproduce the observations, showing that the nuclei are strongly suppressed for E&gt;10Z EeV, either by a rigidity dependent source cutoff or by the photodisintegration interactions with the CMB at the giant dipole resonance. The very mild attenuation effects at lower energies imply that the secondary nuclei from this source only provide a small contribution. Given the moderate anisotropies observed, the deflections in extragalactic and Galactic magnetic fields should play a crucial role in determining the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution. The diffusion in extragalactic fields as well as the finite source lifetime also significantly affect the shape of the observed spectrum. The cosmic ray flux at tens of EeV is dominated by the CNO component, and we show that it is actually better reproduced by a mixture of C and O nuclei rather than by the usual assumption of a N component effectively describing this mass group. The Si and Fe group components become dominant above 70 EeV, in the energy range in which a strong spectral suppression is present. If the localised flux excess appearing above 40 EeV around the Centaurus A direction is attributed to the CNO component, the He nuclei from the source in the energy range from 10 to 20 EeV could lead to a similar anisotropy unless its contribution is suppressed. The cosmic ray flux at a few EeV should mostly result from a more isotropic light component associated to a population of extragalactic sources. The inclusion of the subdominant contribution of heavy nuclei from the Galactic component helps to reproduce the observations around 1 EeV.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and location of ongoing extreme particle acceleration in Cassiopeia A</title>

Abstract: Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the origin of energetic cosmic rays (CRs) below the "knee" of their spectrum at $\sim3$ petaelectronvolt (PeV, $10^{15}$ eV). Nevertheless, the precise location, duration, and operation of CR acceleration in young SNRs are open questions. Here, we report on multi-epoch X-ray observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a 350-year-old SNR, in the 15-50 keV band that probes the most energetic CR electrons. The observed X-ray flux decrease $(15\pm1\%)$, contrary to the expected $&gt;$90\% decrease based on previous radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations, provides unambiguous evidence for CR electron acceleration operating in Cas A. A temporal model for the radio and X-ray data accounting for electron cooling and continuous injection finds that the freshly injected electron spectrum is significantly harder (exponential cutoff power law index $q=2.15$), and its cutoff energy is much higher ($E_{cut}=36$ TeV) than the relic electron spectrum ($q=2.44\pm0.03$, $E_{cut}=4\pm1$ TeV). Both electron spectra are naturally explained by the recently developed modified nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (mNLDSA) mechanism. The CR protons producing the observed gamma rays are likely accelerated at the same location by the same mechanism as those for the injected electron. The Cas A observations and spectral modeling represent the first time radio, X-ray, gamma ray and CR spectra have been self-consistently tied to a specific acceleration mechanism -- mNLDSA -- in a young SNR.</description>

Abstract: A recent phenomenological study of radio emission from normal and millisecond pulsars by Karastergiou et al has lead these authors to state that they are unable to exclude a common physics process as the source although the rotation periods and magnetic fields of these two classes are very different. This has bearing on the nature of that source and it is the purpose the present Letter to explore this problem further, specifically for the ion-proton model and for all those models that assume electron-positron pair creation above the polar cap. The ion-proton model satisfies this commonality whereas pair creation does not. We mention briefly some consequences of these findings.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration via Transient Stagnation Surfaces in MADs During Flux Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the simulation of accretion processes in Magnetically Arrested Disks (MADs) and investigate the dynamics of plasma during flux eruption events.
  We employ general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and search for regions with a divergent velocity during a flux eruption event. These regions would experience rapid and significant depletion of matter. For this reason, we monitor the activation rate of the floor and the mass supply required for stable simulation evolution to further trace this transient stagnation surface.
  Our findings reveal an unexpected and persistent stagnation surface that develops during these eruptions, located around 2-3 gravitational radii (${\rm r_g}$) from the black hole. The stagnation surface is defined by a divergent velocity field and is accompanied by enhanced mass addition. This represents the first report of such a feature in this context. The stagnation surface is ($7-9\,\,{\rm r_g}$) long. We estimate the overall potential difference along this stagnation surface for a supermassive black hole like M87 to be approximately $\Delta V \approx 10^{16}$ Volts.
  Our results indicate that, in MAD configurations, this transient stagnation surface during flux eruption events can be associated with an accelerator of charged particles in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. In light of magnetic reconnection processes during these events, this work presents a complementary or an alternative mechanism for particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>New insight into the orbital parameters of the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057 consists of a Be star and an undetected compact object in a $\sim$317 day orbit. The interpretation of the emission from this system is complicated by the lack of a clear orbital solution, as two different and incompatible orbital solutions were obtained by previous radial velocity studies of this source. In order to address this, we report on 24 new observations, covering $\sim$60 per cent of the orbit which we have undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We obtained new radial velocity measurements from cross-correlation of the narrower spectral features, and by fitting Voigt profiles to the wings of the Balmer emission lines. Additionally, we find an indication of orbital variability in the equivalent widths and V/R of the Balmer lines. Using the combined data from this study, as well as archival data from the earlier radial velocity studies, we have derived updated orbital solutions. Using reported H $\alpha$ emission radial velocities - previously not considered for the orbital solution - along with the new SALT data, a solution is obtained where the brighter peak in the X-ray and gamma-ray light curves is closer to periastron. However, continuing sparse coverage in the data around the expected phases of periastron indicates that the orbital solution could be improved with further observation.</description>

      <title>Kicking the Tires on Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2 \times 10^{-16} M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12} M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 2 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Very-high-energy Diffuse Gamma-ray Emissions from the Galactic Plane with LHAASO-WCDA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission is a very important tool used to study the propagation and interaction of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. In this work, we report the measurements of the diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, covering Galactic longitudes from $15^{\circ}$ to $235^{\circ}$ and latitudes from $-5^{\circ}$ to $+5^{\circ}$, in an energy range of 1 TeV to 25 TeV, with the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). After masking the sky regions of known sources, the diffuse emission is detected with $24.6\sigma$ and $9.1\sigma$ significance in the inner Galactic plane($15^{\circ}&lt;l&lt;125^{\circ}$, $|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$) and outer Galactic plane ($125^{\circ}&lt;l&lt;235^{\circ}$, $|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$), respectively. The WCDA spectra in both regions can be well described by a power-law function, with spectral indices of $-2.67\pm0.05_{\rm stat}$ in the inner region and $-2.83\pm0.19_{\rm stat}$ in the outer region, respectively. Combined with the Square Kilometer Array (KM2A) measurements at higher energies, a clear softening of the spectrum is found in the inner region, with change of spectral indices by $\sim0.5$ at a break energy around $30$ TeV. The fluxes of the diffuse emission are higher by a factor of $1.5-2.7$ than the model prediction assuming local CR spectra and the gas column density, which are consistent with those measured by the KM2A. Along Galactic longitude, the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission shows deviation from that of the gas column density. The spectral shape of the diffuse emission are possibly variation in different longitude region. The results indicate further that the conventional model prediction of diffuse emission from cosmic ray interactions is not enough to account for the observations.</description>

      <title>The fate of EMRI-IMRI pairs in AGN accretion disks: hydrodynamic and three body simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are important gravitational wave (GW) sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It has been recently suggested that EMRIs and IMRIs can both form in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Considering the likely encounter between a sBH and an IMBH during the migration in the AGN disk, Paper I showed that a gap-opening IMBH can drive a surrounding sBH to migrate synchronously. In this work, we extend the study in Paper I with a more sophisticated model. We first use 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study the co-evolution of the disk and the migration of a sBH in the vicinity of an IMBH. We find that the gaseous torque, together with the tidal torque exerted by the IMBH, can drive synchronized migration until $\sim 10$ Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We further use a relativistic three-body code to study the final fate of the sBH in the GW-dominated regime. We find that the sBH can be either captured or kicked out by the IMBH, which will result in either two subsequent IMRIs or an EMRI followed by an IMRI. These events will bring rich information about the formation and evolution of sBHs and IMBHs in AGNs.</description>

      <title>Long Pulse by Short Central Engine: Prompt emission from expanding dissipation rings in the jet front of gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have challenged the long-held opinion that the duration of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is determined by the activity epochs of the central engine. Specifically, the observations of GRB 230307A have revealed a different scenario in which the duration of the prompt emission is predominantly governed by the energy dissipation process following a brief initial energy injection from the central engine. In this paper, we explore a mechanism where the energy injection from the central engine initially causes turbulence in a small region and radiates locally. This turbulence then propagates to more distant regions and radiates. Consequently, the emission regions form concentric rings that extend outward. Using an idealized toy model, we show that such a mechanism, initiated by a pulsed energy injection, can produce a prompt emission light curve resembling a single broad pulse exhibiting the typical softer-wider/softer-later feature. Under some parameters, the main characteristics of the GRB 230307A spectra and light curves can be reproduced by the toy model.</description>

      <title>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of$^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Could the neutrino emission of TXS 0506+056 come from the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy neutrinos from the blazar TXS~0506+056 are usually thought to arise from the relativistic jet pointing to us. However, the composition of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or Poynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays and neutrinos are expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether the neutrino emission from TXS~0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic reconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino flare of TXS~0506+056 in the year of 2014-2015, a super-Eddington accretion is needed. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a steady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term steady neutrino flux from TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically arrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime of accretion. In the MAD scenario, due to a high magnetic field, a large dissipation radius is required to avoid the cooling of protons due to the synchrotron emission.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the Hellings Downs correlation has been observed by different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, such as NANOGrav, European PTA, Parkes PTA, and Chinese PTA. These PTA measurements of the most precise pulsars within the Milky Way show the first evidence for the stochastic gravitational wave background of our Universe. We study the ultralight axion interpretation of the new discovery by investigating the gravitational wave from axion transitions between different energy levels of the gravitational atoms, which are composed of cosmic populated Kerr black holes and their surrounding axion clouds formed through the superradiant process. By Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate that this new observation naturally admits an ultralight axion interpretation around $10^{-21}$~eV, which is consistent in magnitude with the typical mass of fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing chiral and flavored $Z^\prime$ from cosmic bursts through neutrino interactions</title>

Abstract: The origin of tiny neutrino mass is an unsolved puzzle leading to a variety of phenomenological aspects beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We consider $U(1)$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM) where so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated with the help of thee generations of Majorana type right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking of $U(1)$ and electroweak gauge symmetries providing anomaly free structure. In this framework, a neutral BSM gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved. To explore the properties of its interactions we consider chiral (flavored) frameworks where $Z^\prime$ interactions depend on the handedness (generations) of the fermions. In this paper we focus on $Z^\prime-$neutrino interactions which could be probed from cosmic explosions. We consider $\nu \overline{\nu} \to e^+ e^-$ process which can energize gamma-ray burst (GRB221009A, so far the highest energy) through energy deposition. Hence estimating these rates we constrain $U(1)$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and $Z^\prime$ mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$ under Schwarzchild (Sc) and Hartle-Thorne (HT) scenarios. We also study $\nu-$DM scattering through $Z^\prime$ to constrain $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane using IceCube data considering high energy neutrinos from cosmic blazar (TXS0506+056), active galaxy (NGC1068), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Lyman-$\alpha$ data, respectively. Finally highlighting complementarity we compare our results with current and prospective bounds on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane from scattering, beam-dump and $g-2$ experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we embark on the thermodynamic investigation concerning a family of primary charged black holes within the context of shift and parity symmetric Beyond Horndeski gravity. Employing the Euclidean approach, we derive the functional expression for the free energy and derive the first thermodynamic law, offering a methodology to address the challenge of extracting the thermal quantities in shift-symmetric scalar tensor theories characterized by linear time dependence in the scalar field. Following the formal analysis, we provide some illustrative examples focusing on the thermal evaporation of these fascinating objects.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Prospect of unraveling the first-order phase transition in neutron stars with $f$ and $p_1$ modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes of neutron stars are an exciting prospect for analyzing the internal composition of NSs and studying matter at high densities. In this work, we focus on studying the $f$- and $p$- quadrupolar oscillation modes, which couple with gravitational waves. We construct two different equation of state ensembles, one without and one with a first-order phase transition, and examine how $f$- and $p$-modes might help us differentiate them. We find ensemble specific exclusion regions in the $65\%$ and $95\%$ confidence contours of the frequency-damping time relations. The exclusion regions become more prominent for the higher-order oscillation modes. However, these modes have higher frequencies, which are beyond the detection capabilities of present gravitational wave detectors. The quasi-universal relations of dimensionless quantities prove to be ineffective in differentiating the equation of state ensembles, as they obscure the details of the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Generalized uncertainty principle corrections in Rastall-Rainbow Casimir wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 157 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>
