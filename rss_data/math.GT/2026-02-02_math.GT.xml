      <title>Classification of horospherical invariant measures in higher rank: The Full Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify horospherical invariant Radon measures for Anosov subgroups of arbitrary semisimple real algebraic groups. This generalizes the works of Burger and Roblin in rank one to higher ranks. At the same time, this extends the works of Furstenberg, Veech, and Dani, and a special case of Ratner's theorem for finite-volume homogeneous spaces to infinite-volume Anosov homogeneous spaces.
  Especially, this resolves the open problems proposed by Landesberg--Lee--Lindenstrauss--Oh and by Oh. Our measure classification is in fact for a more general class of discrete subgroups, including relatively Anosov subgroups with respect to any parabolic subgroups, not necessarily minimal. Our method is rather geometric, not relying on continuous flows or ergodic theorems.</description>

      <title>Generators for automorphisms of special groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a (compact) special group in the sense of Haglund and Wise. We show that ${\rm Out}(G)$ is finitely generated, and provide a virtual generating set consisting of Dehn twists and ``pseudo-twists''. We exhibit instances where Dehn twists alone do not suffice and completely characterise this phenomenon: it is caused by certain abelian subgroups of $G$, called ``poison subgroups'', which can be removed by replacing $G$ with a finite-index subgroup. Similar results hold for coarse-median preserving automorphisms, without the pathologies: For every special group $G$, the coarse-median preserving subgroups ${\rm Out}(G,[\mu])\leq{\rm Out}(G)$ are virtually generated by finitely many Dehn twists with respect to splittings of $G$ over centralisers. Proofs are based on a novel, hierarchical version of Rips and Sela's shortening argument.</description>

      <title>Open strings on knot complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using skein valued holomorphic curve counting techniques, we give a flow loop formula for the skein valued partition function of the Lagrangian knot complement of a fibered knot (of the $A$-model open topological strings with Lagrangian $A$-branes wrapping the complement) in the cotangent bundle of the three-sphere and in the resolved conifold. For torus knots we show that the partition function in the cotangent bundle localizes on two or three holomorphic annuli and give a corresponding generalized quiver structure for the partition function in the resolved conifold.
  We connect the formula to the augmentation curve, the representation variety of the knot contact homology algebra of the knot, generated by Reeb chords of its Legendrian conormal and with differential given by holomorphic disks interpolating between words of Reeb chords. The curve admits a quantization as a $q$-difference equation for the generating function of symmetrically colored HOMFLYPT-polynomials of the knot or, geometrically, for the $U(1)$-partition function of the knot conormal. For $(2,2p+1)$-torus knots we show that, after a change of variables, the partition function of the knot complement also satisfies this $q$-difference equation. This gives another geometrically defined coordinate chart for the $D$-module defined by the quantized augmentation polynomial.</description>

      <title>Lannes' $T$-functor and mod-$p$ cohomology of profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lannes-Quillen theorem relates the mod-$p$ cohomology of a finite group $G$ with the mod-$p$ cohomology of centralizers of abelian elementary $p$-subgroups of $G$, for $p&gt;0$ a prime number. This theorem was extended to profinite groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology algebra is finitely generated by Henn. In a weaker form, the Lannes-Quillen theorem was then extended by Symonds to arbitrary profinite groups. Building on Symonds' result, we formulate and prove a full version of this theorem for all profinite groups. For this purpose, we develop a theory of products for families of discrete torsion modules, parameterized by a profinite space, which is dual, in a very precise sense, to the theory of coproducts for families of profinite modules, parameterized by a profinite space, developed by Haran, Melnikov and Ribes. In the last section, we give applications to the problem of conjugacy separability of $p$-torsion elements and finite $p$-subgroups.</description>
