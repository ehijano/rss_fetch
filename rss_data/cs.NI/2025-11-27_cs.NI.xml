      <title>Real-World Performance Evaluations of Low-Band 5G NR/4G LTE 4x4 MIMO on Commercial Smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All 3GPP-compliant commercial 5G New Radio (NR)-capable UEs on the market are equipped with 4x4 MIMO support for Mid-Band frequencies (&gt;1.7 GHz) and above, enabling up to rank 4 MIMO transmission. This doubles the theoretical throughput compared to rank 2 MIMO and also improves reception performance. However, 4x4 MIMO support on low-band frequencies (&lt;1 GHz) is absent in every commercial UEs, with the exception of the Xperia 1 flagship smartphones manufactured by Sony Mobile and the Xiaomi 14 Pro as of January 2024. The reason most manufacturers omit 4x4 MIMO support for low-band frequencies is likely due to design challenges or relatively small performance gains in real-world usage due to the lack of 4T4R deployment on low-band by mobile network operators around the world.
  In Thailand, 4T4R deployment on the b28/n28 (APT) band is common on True-H and dtac networks, enabling 4x4 MIMO transmission on supported UEs. In this paper, the real-world 4x4 MIMO performance on the b28/n28 (APT) band will be investigated by evaluating the reliability test under different signal conditions and the maximum throughput test by evaluating the performance under optimal conditions, using the Sony Xperia 1 III and the Sony Xperia 1 IV smartphone. Devices from other manufacturers are also used in the experiment to investigate the performance with 2Rx antennas for comparison. Through firmware modifications, the Sony Xperia 1 III and IV can be configured to use only 2 Rx ports on low-band, enabling the collection of comparative 2 Rx performance data as a reference.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Low-Latency Live Streaming of MPEG-DASH UHD video over Commercial 5G NSA/SA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G Standalone (SA) is the goal of the 5G evolution, which aims to provide higher throughput and lower latency than the existing LTE network. One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population.
  In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal.</description>

      <title>5G Network Automation Using Local Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This demonstration showcases the integration of a lightweight, locally deployed Large Language Model (LLaMA-3 8b Q-4b) empowered by retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to automate 5G network management, with a strong emphasis on privacy. By running the LLM on local or edge devices ,we eliminate the need for external APIs, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure and is not transmitted over the internet. Although lightweight models may not match the performance of more complex models like GPT-4, we enhance their efficiency and accuracy through RAG. RAG retrieves relevant information from a comprehensive database, enabling the LLM to generate more precise and effective network configurations based on natural language user input. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the generated configurations but also simplifies the process of creating and configuring private networks, making it accessible to users without extensive networking or programming experience. The objective of this demonstration is to highlight the potential of combining local LLMs and RAG to deliver secure, efficient, and adaptable 5G network solutions, paving the way for a future where 5G networks are both privacy-conscious and versatile across diverse user profiles.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Driven Secure Access Strategy for SAGIN-Enabled IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN)-enabled IoT networks, secure access has become a significant challenge due to the increasing risks of eavesdropping attacks. To address these threats to data confidentiality, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven secure access strategy. The strategy leverages a virtual replica of the physical SAGIN environment within the DT framework to continuously assess dynamic eavesdropping risks by quantifying secrecy capacity. Operating within this DT framework, an evolutionary game model dynamically balances the DT-updated secrecy capacity against queuing delay, steering IoT devices toward more secure and efficient access decisions. Furthermore, a novel distributed algorithm, integral to the DT operation, is developed to obtain the equilibrium access strategy for each device in a scalable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based approach substantially improves the security of SAGIN-enabled IoT networks. Additionally, it effectively balances system load, prevents overload occurrences, and decreases queuing delay compared to benchmark schemes, thereby comprehensively improving overall network performance.</description>

      <title>LatencyScope: A System-Level Mathematical Framework for 5G RAN Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents LatencyScope, a mathematical framework for accurately computing one-way latency (for uplink and downlink) in the 5G RAN across diverse system configurations. LatencyScope models latency sources at every layer of the Radio Access Network (RAN), pinpointing system-level bottlenecks--such as radio interfaces, scheduling policies, and hardware/software constraints--while capturing their intricate dependencies and their stochastic nature. LatencyScope also includes a configuration optimizer that uses its mathematical models to search through hundreds of billions of configurations and find settings that meet latency-reliability targets under user constraints. We validate LatencyScope on two open-sourced 5G RAN testbeds (srsRAN and OAI), demonstrating that it can closely match empirical latency distributions and significantly outperform prior analytical models and widely used simulators (MATLAB 5G Toolbox, 5G-LENA). It can also find system configurations that meet Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) targets and enable network operators to efficiently identify the best setup for their systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Secure Content-Centric Approaches for 5G-Based IoT: Advances and Emerging Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G technologies is transforming modern communication systems by enabling massive connectivity, low latency, and high-speed data transmission. In this evolving landscape, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional Internet Protocol (IP)-based architectures. CCN offers advantages such as in-network caching, scalability, and efficient content dissemination, all of which are particularly well-suited to the constraints of the IoT. However, deploying content-centric approaches in 5G-based IoT environments introduces significant security challenges. Key concerns include content authentication, data integrity, privacy protection, and resilience against attacks such as spoofing and cache poisoning. Such issues are exacerbated by the distributed, mobile, and heterogeneous nature of IoT and 5G systems. In this survey, we review and classify existing security solutions for content-centric architectures in IoT-5G scenarios. We highlight current trends, identify limitations in existing approaches, and outline future research directions with a focus on lightweight and adaptive security mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Near-realtime Earth Observation Via Starlink LEO Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are collecting vast amounts of data, which are invaluable for applications such as monitoring forest fires. However, data downloading from EO satellites faces significant challenges due to the limited number of ground stations and the brief communication windows with them. Conversely, emerging LEO constellations like Starlink have enabled continuous connectivity and revolutionized access for ordinary users globally, who can connect via a simple satellite dish. In this paper, we study the feasibility of supporting EO satellites with Starlink satellite infrastructure and introduce a novel data delivery system, designated as "Starlink Space User" (SSU), for relaying data from observation satellites. SSU treats EO satellites as space users of Starlink, facilitating efficient data transfer to Earth. At the core of SSU is a novel class of algorithms designed for link and PoP selection, as well as system scheduling optimization, that operate effectively atop Starlink's proprietary infrastructure. We assess the performance of SSU using trace-driven simulations alongside real-world Starlink performance measurements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Starlink-aided design can significantly reduce the median backlog (data not delivered) per satellite.</description>
