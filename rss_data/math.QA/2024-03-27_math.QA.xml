      <title>Quantized semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes present a quick introduction to the q-deformations of semisimple Lie groups from the point of view of unitary representation theory. In order to remain concrete, we concentrate entirely on the case of the lie algebra $\mathrm{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ and its associated compact and complex semisimple Lie groups $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$.
  We treat the following topics: The quantized enveloping algebra and its representations; Hopf algebras and the various notions of quantum groups; real structures; quantized algebras of functions on a compact semisimple group; quantized convolution algebras; the Peter-Weyl theorem; quantized complex semisimple Lie groups as quantum doubles; representations of quantized complex semisimple Lie groups; the quantum analogue of Harish-Chandra's Plancherel formula.</description>

      <title>Residual finiteness of fundamental $n$-quandles of links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate residual finiteness and subquandle separability of quandles. The existence of these finiteness properties implies the solvability of the word problem and the generalised word problem for quandles. We prove that the fundamental $n$-quandle of any link in the 3-sphere is residually finite for each $n \ge 2$. This supplements the recent result on residual finiteness of link quandles and the classification of links whose fundamental $n$-quandles are finite for some $n$. We also establish several general results on these finiteness properties and give many families of quandles admitting them.</description>

      <title>WKB asymptotics of Stokes matrices, spectral curves and rhombus inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $n\times n$ system of ODEs on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with a simple pole $A$ at $z=0$ and a double pole $u={\rm diag}(u_1, \dots, u_n)$ at $z=\infty$. This is the simplest situation in which the monodromy data of the system are described by upper and lower triangular Stokes matrices $S_\pm$, and we impose reality conditions which imply $S_-=S_+^\dagger$. We study leading WKB exponents of Stokes matrices in parametrizations given by generalized minors and by spectral coordinates, and we show that for $u$ on the caterpillar line (which corresponds to the limit $(u_{j+1}-u_j)/(u_j- u_{j-1}) \to \infty$ for $j=2, \cdots, n-1$), the real parts of these exponents are given by periods of certain cycles on the degenerate spectral curve $\Gamma(u_{\rm cat}(t), A)$.
  These cycles admit unique deformations for $u$ near the caterpillar line. Using the spectral network theory, we give for $n=2$, and $n=3$ exact WKB predictions for asymptotics of generalized minors in terms of periods of these cycles. Boalch's theorem from Poisson geometry implies that real parts of leading WKB exponents satisfy the rhombus (or interlacing) inequalities. We show that these inequalities are in correspondence with finite webs of the canonical foliation on the root curve $\Gamma^r(u, A)$, and that they follow from the positivity of the corresponding periods. We conjecture that a similar mechanism applies for $n&gt;3$.
  We also outline the relation of the spectral coordinates with the cluster structures considered by Goncharov-Shen, and with ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories in dimension four associated with some simple quivers.</description>

      <title>Classification of Self-Dual Vertex Operator Superalgebras of Central Charge at Most 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the self-dual (or holomorphic) vertex operator superalgebras of central charge 24, or in physics parlance the purely left-moving, fermionic 2-dimensional conformal field theories with just one primary field.
  There are exactly 969 such vertex operator superalgebras under suitable regularity assumptions (essentially strong rationality) and the assumption that the shorter moonshine module $V\!B^\natural$ is the unique self-dual vertex operator superalgebra of central charge 23.5 whose weight-1/2 and weight-1 spaces vanish. Additionally, there might be self-dual vertex operator superalgebras arising as fake copies of $V\!B^\natural$ tensored with a free fermion $F$.
  We construct and classify the self-dual vertex operator superalgebras by determining the 2-neighbourhood graph of the self-dual vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 and also by realising them as simple-current extensions of a dual pair containing a certain maximal lattice vertex operator algebra. We show that all vertex operator superalgebras besides $V\!B^\natural\otimes F$ and potential fake copies thereof stem from elements of the Conway group $\mathrm{Co}_0$, the automorphism group of the Leech lattice $\Lambda$.
  By splitting off free fermions $F$, if possible, we obtain the classification for all central charges less than or equal to 24.</description>

      <title>On multiplicity-free weight modules over quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, our goal is to construct and study the multiplicity-free weight modules of quantum affine algebras. For this, we introduce the notion of shiftability condition with respect to a symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrix, and investigate its applications on the study of quantum affine algebra structures and the realizations of the infinite-dimensional multiplicity-free weight modules. We also compute the highest $\ell$-weights of the infinite-dimensional multiplicity-free weight modules as highest $\ell$-weight modules.</description>

      <title>Deformed Double Current Algebras, Matrix Extended $\mathcal W_{\infty}$ Algebras, Coproducts, and Intertwiners from the M2-M5 Intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structures which govern the deformation of supersymmetric intersections of M2 and M5 branes. The universal algebras on M2 and M5 branes are deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra respectively. We give a new presentation of the deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$, and we give a rigorous mathematical construction of the $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra. A new presentation of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ is also obtained. We construct various coproducts of these algebras, which are expected to encode the fusions of defects in twisted M-theory. The matrix extended Miura operators are identified as intertwiners in certain bimodules of these algebras.</description>
