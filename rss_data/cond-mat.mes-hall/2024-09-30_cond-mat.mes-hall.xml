      <title>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Keldysh-Usadel formalism unravels crossed Andreev reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a process that creates entanglement between spatially separated electrons and holes. Such entangled pairs have potential applications in quantum information processing, and it is therefore relevant to determine how the probability for CAR can be increased. CAR competes with another non-local process called elastic cotunneling (EC), which does not create entanglement. In conventional normal metal/superconductor/normal metal heterostructures, earlier theoretical work predicted that EC dominates over CAR. Nevertheless, we show numerically that when the Keldysh-Usadel equations are solved self-consistently in the superconductor, CAR can dominate over EC. Self-consistency is necessary both for the conversion from a quasiparticle current to a supercurrent and to describe the spatial variation of the order parameter correctly. A requirement for the CAR probability to surpass the EC probability is that the inverse proximity effect is small. Otherwise, the subvoltage density of states becomes large and EC is strengthened by quasiparticles flowing through the superconductor. Therefore, CAR becomes dominant in the non-local transport with increasing interface resistance and length of the superconducting region. Our results show that even the simplest possible experimental setup with easily accessible normal metals and superconductors can provide dominant CAR by designing the experimental parameters correctly. We also find that spin-splitting in the superconductor increases the subvoltage density of states, and thus always favors EC over CAR. Finally, we tune the chemical potential in the leads such that transport is governed by electrons of one spin type. This can increase the CAR probability at finite values of the spin-splitting compared to using a spin-degenerate voltage bias, and provides a way to control the spin of the conduction electrons electrically.</description>

      <title>Scanning Thermal Microscopy method for self-heating in non-linear devices and application to current filaments in resistive RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive RAM (RRAM) devices are candidates for neuromorphic computing devices in which the functionality lies in the formation and reversible rupture and gap-closing of conducting filaments in insulating layers. To explore the thermal properties of these nanoscale filaments, Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) can be employed. However, since RRAM devices, as well as many other neuromorphic device types, have a non-linear resistance-voltage relationship, the high resolution and quantitative method of AC-modulated SThM cannot readily be used. To this end, an extended non-equilibrium scheme for temperature measurement using SThM is proposed, with which the self-heating of non-linear devices is studied without the need for calibrating the tip-sample contact for a specific material combination, geometry or roughness. Both a DC and an AC voltage are applied to the device, triggering a periodic temperature rise, which enables the simultaneous calculation of the tip-sample thermal resistance and the device temperature rise. The method is applied to $\mathrm{HfO_2}$-based RRAM devices to extract properties like the number of current filaments, thermal confinement and thermal cross-talk. This approach could be applied to other thermometry techniques, including infrafred imaging and Raman thermometry.</description>

      <title>Excitons in Atomically Thin TMD in Electric and Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field dependence of photoabsorption provides direct insights into the band structure of semiconductors. It is perhaps surprising that there is a large discrepancy between electron, hole, and reduced mass reported in the recent literature. Motivated by this puzzle we reconsider excitonic magneto-absorption and find that the commonly employed perturbative approach, namely for computing the diamagnetic shift, is inadequate to account for the parameter ranges considered in existing data. In particular, we develop the theory for strong magnetic field and, upon analysis of the data, arrive at the set of exciton parameters different to what has been estimated perturbatively in the literature. Only s-wave excitons are visible in photoluminescence as the spectral weight of p-wave states is too small, this limits the amount of information that can be extracted about the underlying band structure. To overcome this, we propose to study p-wave states by mixing them with s-wave states by external in-plane electric field and show that a moderate DC electric field would provide sufficient mixing to brighten p-wave states. We calculate energies of the p-wave states including the effects of valley-orbital splitting and the orbital Zeeman shift, and show that this provides direct information on the electron-hole mass asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) at the interface of a bilayer system of a ferromagnetic insulator and graphene. We compare the tunneling spin current at the interface due to the SSE and the spin pumping (SP), where the SSE and SP are induced by the temperature gradient and the microwave irradiation, respectively. We demonstrate that the thermally driven SSE exhibits a quantum oscillation pattern similar to that predicted in coherently driven SP. Additionally, we show a peak shift of the quantum oscillation due to the contribution of thermally excited magnons with higher frequencies, which becomes particularly pronounced at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Torque Driven Chiral Domain Wall Motion in Mn3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear chiral antiferromagnets, such as Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge), have garnered significant interest in spintronics due to their topologically protected Weyl nodes and large momentum-space Berry curvatures. In this study, we report rapid chirality domain-wall (CDW) motion in Mn3Sn, driven by spin-orbit torque at over 545.3 m.s^-1 a remarkably low current density of 9 10^10 A.m^-2. The results demonstrate that the chirality of the domain wall and the direction of the current collectively determine the displacement direction of the CDW. Theoretically, we provide ananalysis of the effective field experienced by the octupole moment, uncovering the underlying motion mechanism based on the unique profile of the chiral spin structure. Notably, CDWs with opposite chirality can form within the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction sample, and the Neel-like CDW type is dictated by the orientation of the kagome plane rather than the negligible magnetostatic energy associated with the small magnetization (approximately 3.957 10^-3). Additionally, the CDW, with a considerable width of 770 nm, is segmented into three 60 portions due to the six-fold anisotropy in Mn3Sn. These emphasize that CDW motion in Mn3Sn cannot be quantitatively studied using ferromagnetic frameworks. We also demonstrate that a small external field can effectively regulate CDW velocity. Our comprehensive results and theoretical analysis provide crucial guidelines for integrating antiferromagnet CDWs into functional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic variants in thin films of Mn5Si3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The altermagnet candidate Mn5Si3 has attracted wide attention in the context of non-relativistic spin physics, due to its composition of light elements. However, the presumed structure of the altermagnetic phase had yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we demonstrate a hallmark of altermagnetism in Mn5Si3 thin films, namely the three options, or variants, for the checkerboard distribution of the magnetic Mn atoms. The magnetic symmetries were altered by field-rotation of the N\'eel vector along relevant crystal directions, resulting in anomalous Hall effect anisotropy. The experimental results in nanoscale devices were corroborated by a theoretical model involving atomic site dependent anisotropy and bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for a single variant.</description>

      <title>Inverted Hanle spin precession induced magnetoresistance in chiral/semiconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, chiral materials have drawn significant attention because it is widely claimed that they can act as spin injectors/detectors due to the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. Nevertheless, the microscopic origin of this effect is not understood, and there is an intensive discussion about the manifestation of the magnetoresistance that is generated between a chiral system and a ferromagnet. Hanle spin precession measurements can unambiguously prove the injection and detection of a spin accumulation in a non-magnetic material, as was shown with traditional ferromagnetic injectors/detectors. Here, we analyze in detail the Hanle spin precession induced magnetoresistance and find that it is inverted as compared to the ferromagnetic case. We explicitly model the spin injection and detection by both a chiral system and a ferromagnetic system, as well as the spin transport in a semiconductor, for a general set of (spin) transport parameters that cover the relevant experimental regime. For all sets of parameters, we find that the Hanle signals for a chiral system and ferromagnet are each others opposites.</description>

      <title>Label-free identification of biomolecules by single-defect-spectroscopy at the aqueous hexagonal boron nitride interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-free single-molecule detection is essential for studying biomolecules in their native state, yet having materials with intrinsic molecular specificity to identify a broad range of molecules without complex functionalization remains challenging. We present a method that utilizes emissions from selectively activated defects at the aqueous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) interface to detect and identify biomolecules, including lipids, nucleotides, and amino acids. Using spectrally-resolved single-molecule localization microscopy combined with machine learning, we harvest spatial, spectral and temporal data of individual events to uncover optical fingerprints of biomolecules. This approach allows us to probe fine chemical differences, as small as the single deprotonation of an amino acid's side chain and detect dynamics of biomolecules at the interface with exceptional detail. As a proof-of-concept, we identified five different amino acids at the single-molecule level with high accuracy. Our findings shed light on hBN-biomolecule interactions and highlight the potential of hBN for label-free single-molecule identification.</description>

      <title>Effects of Peierls phases in open linear chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of Peierls phases in open tight-binding chains without closed paths in either real or synthetic dimensions is understood to be physically inconsequential, as one assumes they can always be gauged away. Here, we show that this assumption does not necessarily hold for all systems in open chains, as closed paths may appear in the Fock space where these phases can lead to the creation of magnetic flux analogs with physical effects. This idea is first illustrated in the quadratic Kitaev model, where different patterns for the Peierls phases are studied and their independent manipulation is seen to be able to drive the appearance of topological states and Majorana flat bands. We then consider a system with quartic interactions, namely an extended Bose-Hubbard (EBH) open chain with a finite Peierls phase associated with the hopping terms. Focusing on the strong interactions limit of the two-body sector, we show the decisive influence of these phases on the two-band spectrum of the higher energy subspace, which behaves as an effective sawtooth chain with magnetic flux at each plaquette. In particular, both the width of the energy gap between the two bands and the position of the in-gap edge states can be controlled by the Peierls phase. Finally, by translating this two-particle one-dimensional (1D) system into a single-particle two-dimensional (2D) one, and subsequently mapping it onto an equivalent electrical LC circuit, we identify a parameter set for which in-gap states are only present for certain finite phase values. Tuning the circuit to these parameters generates the corresponding boundary voltage states, providing an experimentally detectable signature of the effects induced by manipulating Peierls phases in a model built on an open linear chain.</description>

      <title>Correlated states in super-moire materials with a kernel polynomial quantics tensor cross algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-moire materials represent a novel playground to engineer states of matter beyond the possibilities of conventional moire materials. However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moire materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moire materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moire structure to a many-body Hilbert space efficiently sampled with a tensor cross matrix product state method, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moire systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moire-of-moire systems and domain walls between different moire systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moire phenomena.</description>

      <title>Shaping terahertz waves using anisotropic shear modes in a van der Waals mineral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturally occurring van der Waals (vdW) materials are currently attracting significant interest due to their potential as low-cost sources of two-dimensional materials. Valuable information on vdW materials' interlayer interactions is present in their low-frequency rigid-layer phonon spectra, which are experimentally accessible by terahertz spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we have used polarization-sensitive terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to investigate a bulk sample of the naturally abundant, large bandgap vdW mineral clinochlore. We observed a strong and sharp anisotropic resonance in the complex refractive index spectrum near 1.13 THz, consistent with our density functional theory predictions for shear modes. Polarimetry analysis revealed that the shear phonon anisotropy reshapes the polarization state of transmitted THz waves, inducing Faraday rotation and ellipticity. Furthermore, we used Jones formalism to discuss clinochlore phononic symmetries and describe our observations in terms of its eigenstates of polarization. These results highlight the potential of exploring vdW minerals as central building blocks for vdW heterostructures with compelling technological applications.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing sp3-type defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of sp3 doping. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.7 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Unitary Transmission Matrices in Silicon Photonic Coupled Waveguide Arrays using a Neural Adjoint Model</title>

Abstract: The development of low-loss reconfigurable integrated optical devices enables further research into technologies including photonic signal processing, analogue quantum computing, and optical neural networks. Here, we introduce digital patterning of coupled waveguide arrays as a platform capable of implementing unitary matrix operations. Determining the required device geometry for a specific optical output is computationally challenging and requires a robust and versatile inverse design protocol. In this work we present an approach using high speed neural network surrogate based gradient optimization, capable of predicting patterns of refractive index perturbations based on switching of the ultra-low loss chalcogenide phase change material, antimony tri-selinide ($\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$). Results for a $3 \times 3$ silicon waveguide array are presented, demonstrating control of both amplitude and phase for each transmission matrix element. Network performance is studied using neural network optimization tools such as dataset augmentation and supplementation with random noise, resulting in an average fidelity of 0.94 for unitary matrix targets. Our results show that coupled waveguide arrays with perturbation patterns offer new routes for achieving programmable integrated photonics with a reduced footprint compared to conventional interferometer-mesh technology.</description>

      <title>Understanding the chemical and structural variability in the efficiency of band edge optical transitions of 2D monolayer materials</title>

Abstract: We conducted a high-throughput density functional theory calculation and comprehensive analysis of the momentum matrix elements between the band edges across a wide range of nonmagnetic two-dimensional monolayer materials with direct band gaps. The primary objectives of our study were twofold: (i) to identify and rank the materials as potential optical emitters and (ii) to enhance our understanding of the physical and chemical factors that determine the strength of the optical coupling. The momentum matrix elements range from nearly 0 to 1.13 at.u., depending on the specific structure and composition of the materials. By comparison, the most prominent group III-V bulk semiconductors have momentum matrix elements on the order of 1 at.u., indicating the high potential of two-dimensional monolayer materials as optical emitters. We applied a criterion derived from the atomic orbital selection rules for electronic transitions. Finally, we examined the prominent family of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, which exhibited high optical coupling and low criterion values. We propose a connection between the significant contribution to the momentum matrix elements for interband optical transitions and the anomalous Born effective charge phenomena. The implications of this phenomenon are such that, unlike materials that exhibit conventional Born effective charges, in which increased ionicity leads to diminished optical coupling. If the anomalous situation is present, it arises from a distinctive charge transfer and bonding mechanism, resulting in a positive correlation between ionicity and the optical coupling.</description>

      <title>Achieving Different Stoichiometries and Morphologies in Vapor Phase Deposition of Inorganic Halide Perovskites: Single or Dual Precursor Sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inorganic halide perovskites have become attractive for many optoelectronic applications due to their outstanding properties. While chemical synthesis techniques have been successful in producing high-quality perovskite crystals, scaling up to wafer-scale thin films remains challenging. Vapor deposition methods, particularly physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition, have emerged as potential solutions for large-scale thin film fabrication. However, the control of phase purity during deposition remains problematic. Here, we investigate single-source (CsPbBr3) and dual-source (CsBr and PbBr2) vapor deposition techniques to achieve phase-pure CsPbBr3 thin films. Utilizing Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry, we demonstrate that while the single-source CsPbBr3 evaporation is partially congruent, it leads to compositional changes in the evaporant over time. The dual-source evaporation, with a precise control of the PbBr2/CsBr flux ratio, can improve phase purity, particularly at elevated substrate temperatures at excess PbBr2 conditions. Our results give direct evidence that the growth is CsBr-limited. Overall, our findings provide critical insights into the vapor phase deposition processes, highlighting the importance of evaporation conditions in achieving the desired inorganic perovskite stoichiometry and morphology.</description>

Abstract: The deposition of a two-dimensional material on the surface of a three-dimensional crystal can generate superlattices with electronic properties modified through the proximity spin-orbit effect. In this study, we found that Kekul\'e graphene superlattices are obtained by placing graphene on Cd-terminated (001)-(1$\times$1) cadmium sulfide (CdS) surface. From an effective model of Kekul\'e superlattices, which is corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we identified that the puckered surfqace of CdS modifies the on-site energies (staggered potential) and C-C bonds, giving rise to two possible $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ hexagonal superlattices, which are known as Kekul\'e-O graphene and Kekul\'e-Y with a quadratic band crossing point. Both Kekul\'e superlattices present spin-orbit coupling due to the interaction of graphene with the CdS surface. To guide the experimental realization of Kekul\'e superlattices based on graphene/CdS heterostructures, we simulate electron diffraction patterns, as well as images from High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy in the mode of High Angle Annular Dark Field (STEM-HAADF).</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of exciton diffusion near an electronic Mott insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bose-Fermi mixtures naturally appear in various physical systems. In semiconductor heterostructures, such mixtures can be realized, with bosons as excitons and fermions as dopant charges. However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges the comprehension of the mechanisms that determine physical properties such as mobility. In this study, we investigate interlayer exciton diffusion in an H-stacked WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer. Our measurements are performed in the dilute exciton density limit at low temperatures to examine how the presence of charges affects exciton mobility. Remarkably, for charge doping near the Mott insulator phase, we observe a giant enhancement of exciton diffusion of three orders of magnitude compared to charge neutrality. We attribute this observation to mobile valence holes, which experience a suppressed moir\'e potential due to the electronic charge order in the conduction band, and recombine with any conduction electron in a non-monogamous manner. This new mechanism emerges for sufficiently large fillings in the vicinity of correlated generalized Wigner crystal and Mott insulating states. Our results demonstrate the potential to characterize correlated electron states through exciton diffusion and provide insights into the rich interplay of bosons and fermions in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetically induced ferroelectrics in multiferroics provide an optimal approach to pursuit intrinsically strong magnetoelectricity. However, the complex antiferromagnetism, faint magnetically induced polarization, and low working temperatures make their magnetoelectric performance incompetent from the applications demands. Here, a family of two-dimensional $5d$ halides Os$X_2$ monolayers is predicted to be ferroelectric and ferromagnetic above room temperature. More interestingly, benefiting from the strong spin-orbital coupling and high-spin state of Os$^{2+}$ ion, the magnetically induced ferroelectric polarization can reach $5.9$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$, a record-large value in type-II multiferroics. The magnetoelectric effect, that is, controlling ferroelectric polarization by magnetic field has been demonstrated, and magnetically driven ferrovalley also emerges in this system. This work provides an effective way to solve the main defects of type-II multiferroics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional (2D) Dirac semimetal with concomitant superconductivity has been long sought but rarely reported. It is believed that light-element materials have the potential to realize this goal owing to their intrinsic lightweight and metallicity. Here, based on the recently synthesized $\beta_{12}$ hydrogenated borophene [Science 371, 1143 (2021)], we investigate its counterpart named $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$. Our first-principles calculations suggest it has good stability. $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is a scarce Dirac semimetal demonstrating a strain-tunable phase transition from three Dirac cones to a single Dirac cone. Additionally, $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is also a superior phonon-mediated superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of 32.4 K and can be further boosted to 42 K under external strain. The concurrence of Dirac fermions and superconductivity, supplemented with dual tunabilities, reveals $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is an attractive platform to study either quantum phase transition in 2D Dirac semimetal or the superconductivity or the exotic physics brought about by their interplay.</description>

      <title>Giant Magneto-Exciton Coupling in 2D van der Waals CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic order via external fields or heterostructures enables precise manipulation and tracking of spin and exciton information, facilitating the development of high-performance optical spin valves. However, the weak magneto-optical signals and instability of two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials have hindered comprehensive studies on the complex coupling between magnetic order and excitons in bulk-like systems. Here, we leverage magneto-optical spectroscopy to reveal the impact of magnetic order on exciton-phonon coupling and exciton-magnetic order coupling which remains robust even under non-extreme temperature conditions (80 K) in thick layered CrSBr. A 0.425T in-plane magnetic field is sufficient to induce spin flipping and transition from AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) magnetic order in CrSBr, while magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy under an out-of-plane magnetic field provides direct insight into the complex spin canting behavior in thicker layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong coupling between excitons and magnetic order, especially the 32 meV exciton energy shift during magnetic transitions, stems from the hybridization of Cr and S orbitals and the larger exciton wavefunction radius of higher-energy B excitons. These findings offer new opportunities and a solid foundation for future exploration of 2D AFM materials in magneto-optical sensors and quantum communication using excitons as spin carriers.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Truncated-Wigner-Approximation Theory of Molecular Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Optical Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular exciton polaritons are hybrid states resulting from the strong coupling of molecular electronic excitations with an optical cavity mode, presenting a promising approach for controlling photophysical and photochemical properties in molecular systems. In this study, we develop a semiclassical theory for molecular exciton-polariton dynamics using the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) to explore the collective behavior of molecular electronic excited states under strong light-matter coupling. Our approach expands the previously developed TWA theory for molecular vibration-polariton dynamics (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 3019--3027) by incorporating semiclassical treatment of quantum coherence between ground and excited molecular states. We initially apply the TWA theory to a simplified system of molecules modeled as two-level (spin-1/2) systems, omitting vibronic coupling. The semiclassical results derived from applying the TWA to single-spin operators demonstrate excellent agreement with full quantum dynamic simulations in systems with a sufficiently large number of molecules. Lastly, the TWA theory is extended to incorporate molecular vibronic coupling, revealing the dynamic polaron decoupling effect, where quantum coherence between molecular excitations is preserved under strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons are fundamental excitations that govern the optical properties of semiconductors. Interacting excitons can lead to various emergent phases of matter and large nonlinear optical responses. In most semiconductors, excitons interact via exchange interaction or phase space filling. Correlated materials that host excitons coupled to other degrees of freedom offer hitherto unexplored pathways for controlling these interactions. Here, we demonstrate magnon-mediated excitonic interactions in CrSBr, an antiferromagnetic semiconductor. This interaction manifests as the dependence of exciton energy on exciton density via a magnonic adjustment of the spin canting angle. Our study demonstrates the emergence of quasiparticle-mediated interactions in correlated quantum materials, leading to large nonlinear optical responses and potential device concepts such as magnon-mediated quantum transducers.</description>

      <title>Atomically Flat Dielectric Patterns for Band Gap Engineering and Lateral Junction Formation in MoSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining a precise sputter etching method with subsequent AlO$_x$ growth within an atomic layer deposition chamber enables fabrication of atomically flat lateral patterns of SiO$_2$ and AlO$_x$. The transfer of MoSe$_2$ monolayers onto these dielectrically modulated substrates results in formation of lateral heterojunctions, with the flat substrate topography leading to minimal strain across the junction. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements show significant variations in the contact potential difference (CPD) across the interface, with AlO$_x$ regions inducing a 230~mV increase in CPD. Spatially resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals shifts in spectral weight of neutral and charged exciton species across the different dielectric regions. On the AlO$_x$ side, the Fermi energy moves closer to the conduction band, leading to a higher trion-to-exciton ratio, indicating a bandgap shift consistent with CPD changes. In addition, transient reflection spectroscopy highlights the influence of the dielectric environment on carrier dynamics, with the SiO$_2$ side exhibiting rapid carrier decay typical of neutral exciton recombination. In contrast, the AlO$_x$ side shows slower, mixed decay behavior consistent with conversion of trions back into excitons. These results demonstrate how dielectric substrate engineering can tune the electronic and optical characteristics of proximal two-dimensional materials, allowing scalable fabrication of advanced junctions for novel (opto)electronics applications.</description>

Abstract: We consider a multilayered metamaterial composed of anisotropic layers with in-plane anisotropy axes periodically rotated with respect to each other. Due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, the structure develops an effective chirality. We derive the effective chirality tensor of the metamaterial describing both normal and oblique incidence scenarios. We also identify the arrangement of the layers maximizing chiral response for the fixed lattice period, wavelength and anisotropy of the layers.</description>

Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function clarifies the importance of orbital angular momentum to bulk thermodynamics in addition to the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. In particular, we make an experimentally testable prediction that the orbital contribution should preponderate over the spin contribution, and thus flip the sign of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the complexity of quantum systems in the real world, models with just a few effective many-body states often suffice to describe their quantum dynamics, provided decoherence is accounted for. We show that a machine learning algorithm is able to construct such models, given a straightforward set of quantum dynamics measurements. The effective Hilbert space can be a black box, with variations of the coupling to just one accessible output state being sufficient to generate the required training data. We demonstrate through simulations of a Markovian open quantum system that a neural network can automatically detect the number $N $ of effective states and the most relevant Hamiltonian terms and state-dephasing processes and rates. For systems with $N\leq5$ we find typical mean relative errors of predictions in the $10 \%$ range. With more advanced networks and larger training sets, it is conceivable that a future single software can provide the automated first stop solution to model building for an unknown device or system, complementing and validating the conventional approach based on physical insight into the system.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the interplay between quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity, which causes nontrivial effects on the structural and dynamical characteristics of silicene, a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of silicon with interesting electronic and mechanical properties. Employing path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations, we investigate the quantum delocalization of nuclei, unraveling its impact on the behavior of silicene at the atomic scale. Our study reveals that this delocalization induces significant deviations in the structural parameters of silicene, influencing in-plane surface area, bond lengths, angles, compressibility, and overall lattice dynamics. Through extensive simulations, we delve into the temperature-dependent behavior between 25 and 1200 K, unveiling the role of quantum nuclear fluctuations in dictating thermal expansion and phonon spectra. The extent of nuclear quantum effects is assessed by comparing results of PIMD simulations using an efficient tight-binding Hamiltonian, with those obtained from classical molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the magnitude of quantum effects in this material with those in other related 2D crystalline solids, such as graphene and SiC monolayers. The observed quantum effects showcase non-negligible deviations from classical predictions, emphasizing the need for accurate quantum treatments in understanding the material's behavior at finite temperatures. At low $T$, the 2D compression modulus of silicene decreases by a 14% due to quantum nuclear motion.</description>

      <title>Electrical Spectroscopy of Polaritonic Nanoresonators</title>

Abstract: One of the most captivating properties of polaritons is their capacity to confine light at the nanoscale. This confinement is even more extreme in two-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D polaritons have been investigated by optical measurements using an external photodetector. However, their effective spectrally resolved electrical detection via far-field excitation remains unexplored. This fact hinders their potential exploitation in crucial applications such as sensing molecules and gases, hyperspectral imaging and optical spectrometry, banking on their potential for integration with silicon technologies. Herein, we present the first electrical spectroscopy of polaritonic nanoresonators based on a high-quality 2D-material heterostructure, which serves at the same time as the photodetector and the polaritonic platform. We employ metallic nanorods to create hybrid nanoresonators within the hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic medium in the mid and long-wave infrared ranges. Subsequently, we electrically detect these resonators by near-field coupling to a graphene pn-junction. The nanoresonators simultaneously present a record of lateral confinement and high-quality factors of up to 200, exhibiting prominent peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, particularly at the underexplored lower reststrahlen band of hBN. We exploit the geometrical and gate tunability of these nanoresonators to investigate their impact on the photocurrent spectrum and the polaritonic's waveguided modes. This work opens a venue for studying this highly tunable and complex hybrid system, as well as for using it in compact platforms for sensing and photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Enabling P-type Conduction in Bilayer WS2 with NbP Topological Semimetal Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising for low-power complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, which require ultrathin n- and p-type transistor channels. Among 2D semiconductors, WS2 is expected to have good conduction for both electrons and holes, but p-type WS2 transistors have been difficult to realize due to the relatively deep valence band and the presence of mid-gap states with conventional metal contacts. Here, we report topological semimetal NbP as p-type electrical contacts to bilayer WS2 with up to 5.8 microamperes per micron hole current at room temperature; this is the highest to date for sub 2 nm thin WS2 and more than 50 times larger than with metals like Ni or Pd. The p-type conduction is enabled by the simultaneously high work function and low density of states of the NbP, which reduce Fermi level pinning. These contacts are sputter-deposited at room temperature, an approach compatible with CMOS fabrication, a step towards enabling ultrathin WS2 semiconductors in future nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Simulation and Machine Learning Facilitated Design of Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials-Based Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional transistors based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are facing significant limitations as device scaling reaches the limits of Moore's Law. These limitations include increased leakage currents, pronounced short-channel effects (SCEs), and quantum tunneling through the gate oxide, leading to higher power consumption and deviations from ideal behavior. Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) can overcome these challenges by utilizing quantum tunneling of charge carriers to switch between on and off states and achieve a subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV/decade. This allows for lower power consumption, continued scaling, and improved performance in low-power applications. This review focuses on the design and operation of TFETs, emphasizing the optimization of device performance through material selection and advanced simulation techniques. The discussion will specifically address the use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in TFET design and explore simulation methods ranging from multi-scale (MS) approaches to machine learning (ML)-driven optimization.</description>

Abstract: We study the frequency-dependent noise of a suspended carbon nanotube quantum dot nanoelectromechanical resonator induced by electron-vibration coupling. Using a rigorous Keldysh diagrammatic technique, we establish a formal framework connecting the vibrational properties to electrical measurements. We find that the noise power spectrum exhibits a narrow resonant peak at the frequency of the vibrational modes. However, this fine structure tends to disappear due to a coherent cancellation effect when the tunneling barriers are tuned to a symmetric point. Notably, measuring the electrical current noise spectra provides a sensitive alternative method for detecting the damping and dephasing of quantum vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Position operators and interband matrix elements of scalar and vector potentials in the 8-band Kane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We diagonalize the 8-band Kane Hamiltonian with a proper inclusion of the interband matrix elements of the scalar and vector potentials. This leads, among other results, to a modification of the conventional expression for the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength in narrow-gap semiconductors with the zinc blende symmetry. We find that in GaAs, at low temperatures, the correct expression for the SOC strength is actually twice as large as usually considered. In InSb it is $1.76$ times larger. We also provide a proper treatment of the interband matrix elements of the position operator. We show that the velocity operator in a crystal should be defined as a time-derivative of a fictitious position operator rather than the physical one. We compute the expressions for both these position operators projected to the conduction band of the 8-band Kane model. We also derive an expression for the projected velocity operator and demonstrate that the SOC strength in it differs from the SOC strength in the Hamiltonian. The ratio between them is not equal to $1$, as it is often assumed for the Rashba model. It does not equal $2$ either. The correct result for this ratio is given by a rational function of the parameters of the model. This function takes values between $4(23+3\sqrt{2})/73\approx 1.49$ and $2$. Our findings modify a vast number of research results obtained using the Rashba model and provide a path for a consistent treatment of the latter in future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the non-linear DC photoconductivity of graphene under strong infra-red (IR) radiation. The photoconductivity is obtained as the response to a strong DC electric field, with field strengths outside of the linear-response regime, while the IR radiation is described by a strong AC electric field. The conductivity displays two distinct regimes in which either the DC or the AC field dominates. We explore these regimes and associate them with the dynamics of driven Landau-Zener quenches in the case of a large DC field. In the limit of large AC field, we describe the conductivity in a Floquet picture and compare the results to the closely related Tien-Gordon effect. We present analytical calculations for the non-linear differential photoconductivity, for both regimes based on the corresponding mechanisms. As part of this discussion of the non-equilibrium state of graphene, we present analytical estimates of the conductivity of undriven graphene as a function of temperature and DC bias field strength that show very good agreement with our simulations.</description>

      <title>Dark versus blocking states in electronic transport: a Lee-Yang zero analysis of full counting statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic transport through nanostructures can be suppressed by coherent population trapping, in which quantum coherence leads to a dark state that decouples from the drain electrode. Finite transport, then, relies on decoherence of the dark state. An alternative scenario for reduced transport is weak coupling of a state, referred to as a blocking state, to the drain. This raises the question of whether and how these two scenarios can be distinguished in the transport features. For the example of electron transport through a carbon nanotube, we identify regimes, in which this distinction is possible by analyzing the full counting statistics in terms of Lee-Yang zeros and factorial cumulants.</description>

Abstract: We present QDarts, an efficient simulator for realistic charge stability diagrams of quantum dot array (QDA) devices in equilibrium states. It allows for pinpointing the location of concrete charge states and their transitions in a high-dimensional voltage space (via arbitrary two-dimensional cuts through it), and includes effects of finite tunnel coupling, non-constant charging energy and a simulation of noisy sensor dots. These features enable close matching of various experimental results in the literature, and the package hence provides a flexible tool for testing QDA experiments, as well as opening the avenue for developing new methods of device tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that 1D lattice models exhibit superdiffusive transport in the presence of random "nodal impurities" in the absence of interaction. Here a nodal impurity is defined as a localized state, the wave function of which has zeros (nodes) in momentum space. The dynamics exponent $z$, a defining quantity for transport behaviors, is computed to establish this result. To be specific, in a disordered system having only nodal impurities, the dynamical exponent $z=4n/(4n-1)$ where $n$ is the order of the node. If the system has time reversal, the nodes appear in pairs and the dynamical exponent can be enhanced to $z=8n/(8n-1)$. As $1&lt;z&lt;2$, both cases indicate superdiffusive transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of alternating-twist tetralayer graphene, especially near its magic angle $\theta = 1.75^\circ$, for different AA, AB, and SP sliding geometries at their middle interface that divides two twisted bilayer graphenes. This sliding dependence is shown for the bandwidths, band gaps, and $K$-valley Chern numbers of the lowest-energy valence and conduction bands as a function of twist angle and interlayer potential difference. Our analysis reveals that the AA sliding is most favorable for narrow bands and gaps, and the AB sliding is most prone to developing finite valley Chern numbers. We further analyze the linear longitudinal optical absorptions as a function of photon energy and the absorption map in the moir\'{e} Brillouin zone for specific transition energies. A self-consistent Hartree calculation reveals that the AA system's electronic structure is the most sensitive to variations in carrier density.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven systems offer a perfect breeding ground for out-of-equilibrium engineering of topological boundary states at zero energy ($0$-mode), as well as finite energy ($\pi$-mode), with the latter having no static analog. The Floquet operator and the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which encapsulate the stroboscopic features of the driven system, capture both spectral and localization properties of the $0$- and $\pi$-modes but sometimes fail to provide complete topological characterization, especially when $0$- and $\pi$-modes coexist. In this work, we utilize the spectral localizer, a powerful local probe that can provide numerically efficient, spatially local, and energy-resolved topological characterization. In particular, we apply the spectral localizer to the effective Floquet Hamiltonian for driven one- and two-dimensional topological systems with no or limited symmetries and are able to assign topological invariants, or local markers, that characterize the $0$- and the $\pi$-boundary modes individually and unambiguously. Due to the spatial resolution, we also demonstrate that the extracted topological invariants are suitable for studying driven disordered systems and can even capture disorder-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets exhibiting frustration. Their resonant magnetization dynamics have been broadly investigated from fundamental and applied points of view. In this work, we realize a dynamically driven macroscopic mechano-magnetic artificial spin ice, or macro-ASI, where permanent magnets are allowed to rotate on specially designed hinges and exhibit natural resonance frequencies on the order of several Hertz. A nonlinear dynamical regime is achieved experimentally and well reproduced by numerical modelling. The modulation of the magnetic coupling leads to a frequency comb that manifests itself as an amplitude-phase modulation of the magnets' motion due to a metastable condition, i.e., a Hopf bifurcation. Our results not only demonstrate a striking similarity across different physical systems, but also suggest that the mechanism to enable nonlinear phenomena could be realized in nanoscale systems using microresonators decorated with magnetic materials to dynamically modulate their coupling.</description>

      <title>Coupled Spin and Valley Hall Effects Driven by Coherent Tunneling</title>

Abstract: We predict the coexistence of tunneling spin and valley Hall effects when electrons in graphene coherently transmit through a barrier with broken inversion symmetry and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Due to the rotation of the pseudospin in the tunneling process, the transmitted electrons acquire a finite spin- and valley-dependent backreflection geometric phase when the two interfaces of the barrier are asymmetric. This results in a spin- and valley-dependent skew coherent tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse spin and valley Hall currents. We further demonstrate that the coherent-tunneling assisted charge-spin and charge-valley conversions are highly efficient with large Hall angles. Our work provides a new route for the generation of efficient spin and valley Hall effects, suggesting potential applications for spintronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Polaromechanics: photons, magnons and phonons in the triple strong-coupling regime</title>

Abstract: Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel polaromechanical hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at low bath temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</description>

      <title>Low-energy optical sum-rule in moir\'e graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few layers of graphene at small twist-angles have emerged as a fascinating platform for studying the problem of strong interactions in regimes with a nearly quenched single-particle kinetic energy and non-trivial band topology. Starting from the strong-coupling limit of twisted bilayer graphene with a vanishing single-electron bandwidth and interlayer-tunneling between the same sublattice sites, we present an {\it exact} analytical theory of the Coulomb interaction-induced low-energy optical spectral weight at all {\it integer} fillings. In this limit, while the interaction-induced single-particle dispersion is finite, the optical spectral weight vanishes identically at integer fillings. We study corrections to the optical spectral weight by systematically including the effects of experimentally relevant strain-induced renormalization of the single-electron bandwidth and interlayer tunnelings between the same sublattice sites. Given the relationship between the optical spectral weight and the diamagnetic response that controls superconducting $T_c$, our results highlight the relative importance of specific parent insulating phases in enhancing the tendency towards superconductivity when doped away from integer fillings.</description>

      <title>Quantum limitation on experimental testing of non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems</title>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Atomic Structures on Faceted and Nonflat Surfaces by the Difference-of-Gaussians Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detailed analysis of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) data acquired for faceted and non-flat surfaces is usually complicated due to the presence of a large number of surface areas tilted by large/variable angles relative to the scanning plane. As a consequence, standard methods of elimination of global or local slopes by either a plane subtraction or numerical differentiation seem to be ineffective. We demonstrate that a simple difference-of-Gaussians procedure provides output data corresponding to projection of a considered surface onto the scanning plane without undesirable contrast modifications. This method allows us to suppress small-scale noise, minimize effects of finite slopes in the SPM images along both fast and slow scanning directions and removes surface ripples without active participation of the operator. This method can be applied for fast on-the-fly visualization of experimental data, and for more detailed analysis, including high-precision determination of lattice parameters and angles between translation vectors for surface reconstruction of different terraces or surface domains. In order to estimate geometrical distortions introduced by our procedure, we compare the results obtained by the difference-of-Gaussians approach for the tilted surfaces with direct image rotation in 3D space.</description>
