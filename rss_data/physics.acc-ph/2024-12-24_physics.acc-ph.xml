      <title>Technical Status Report on Plasma Components and Systems in the context of EuPRAXIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EuPRAXIA project aims to construct two state-of-the-art accelerator facilities based on plasma accelerator technology. Plasma-based accelerators offer the possibility of a significant reduction in facility size and cost savings over current radio frequency (RF) accelerators. The two facilities - one laser-driven one a beam-driven - are envisioned to provide electron beams with an energy in the range of 1-5 GeV and beam quality comparable to existing RF machines. This will enable a versatile portfolio of applications from compact free-electron laser (FEL) drivers to sources for medical and industrial imaging.
  At the heart of both facilities is the use of plasma-based accelerator components and systems which encompass not only the accelerating medium itself, but also a range of auxiliary systems such as plasma-based electron beam optics and plasma-based mirrors for high-intensity lasers. From a technical standpoint, a high-degree of control over these plasma devices will be essential for EuPRAXIA to achieve its target performance goals. The ability to diagnose and characterize these plasma devices and to simulate their operation will be further essential success factors. Additionally, compatibility with extended operation at high-repetition rates and integration into the accelerator beamline will also prove crucial.
  In this work, we aim to review the current status of plasma components and related systems for both laser-driven and beam-driven plasma accelerators and to assess challenges to be addressed regarding implementation at future EuPRAXIA facilities.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic AI on Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized to control individual accelerator components.
  This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show three examples, where we demonstrate the viability of such architecture.</description>

      <title>Laser wakefield acceleration of ions with a transverse flying focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>
