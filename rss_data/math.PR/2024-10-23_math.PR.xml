      <title>Information-Based Martingale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized arcade processes are a class of continuous stochastic processes that interpolate in a strong sense, i.e., omega by omega, between any given ordered set of random variables, at fixed pre-specified times. Utilizing these processes as generators of partial information, a class of continuous-time martingale -- the filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) -- is constructed. FAMs interpolate through a sequence of target random variables, which form a discrete-time martingale. The research presented in this paper treats the problem of selecting the worst martingale coupling for given, convexly ordered, probability measures contingent on the paths of FAMs that are constructed using the martingale coupling. This optimization problem, that we term the information-based martingale optimal transport problem (IB-MOT), can be viewed from different perspectives. It can be understood as a model-free construction of FAMs, in the case where the coupling is not determined, {\it a priori}. It can also be considered from the vantage point of optimal transport (OT), where the problem is concerned with introducing a noise factor in martingale optimal transport, similarly to how the entropic regularization of optimal transport introduces noise in OT. The IB-MOT problem is static in its nature, since it is concerned with finding a coupling, but a corresponding dynamical solution can be found by considering the FAM constructed with the identified optimal coupling. Existence and uniqueness of its solution are shown, and an algorithm for empirical measures is proposed.</description>

      <title>Outliers of perturbations of banded Toeplitz matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toeplitz matrices form a rich class of possibly non-normal matrices whose asymptotic spectral analysis in high dimension is well-understood. The spectra of these matrices are notoriously highly sensitive to small perturbations. In this work, we analyze the spectrum of a banded Toeplitz matrix perturbed by a random matrix with iid entries of variance $\sigma_n^2 / n$ in the asymptotic of high dimension and $\sigma_n$ converging to $\sigma \geq 0$. Our results complement and provide new proofs on recent progresses in the case $\sigma = 0$. For any $\sigma \geq 0$, we show that the point process of outlier eigenvalues is governed by a low-dimensional random analytic matrix field, typically Gaussian, alongside an explicit deterministic matrix that captures the algebraic structure of the resonances responsible for the outlier eigenvalues. On our way, we prove a new functional central limit theorem for trace of polynomials in deterministic and random matrices and present new variations around Szego's strong limit theorem.</description>

      <title>The circular law for random band matrices: improved bandwidth for general models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the convergence of ESD for non-Hermitian random band matrices with independent entries to the circular law, where the bandwidth scales like $n^\gamma$ and $n$ is the matrix size. We prove that the circular law limit holds provided that $\gamma&gt;\frac{5}{6}$ for a very general class of inhomogeneous matrix models with Gaussian distribution and doubly stochastic variance profile, and provided that $\gamma&gt;\frac{8}{9}$ if entries have symmetric subGaussian distribution. This improves previous works which essentially require $\gamma&gt;\frac{32}{33}$. We also prove an extended form of product circular law with a growing number of matrices. Weak delocalization estimates on eigenvectors are also derived. The new technical input is new polynomial lower bounds on some intermediate small singular values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the construction of the semigroup of the two-dimensional delta-Bose gas in Gu, Quastel, and Tsai (2021) (based on Rajeev (1999) and Dimock and Rajeev (2004)) to a weighted $L^2$ space that allows exponentially growing functions. We further show that the semigroup of the mollified delta-Bose gas converges strongly to that of the delta-Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new spanning tree model called the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE), which interpolates between the uniform spanning tree and the minimum spanning tree as the inverse temperature (disorder strength) $\beta$ varies. On the complete graph with $n$ vertices and i.i.d.\ uniform disorder variables on the edges, we identify: (1) a low disorder regime with $\beta \leq C n/\log n$, where the diameter of the random spanning tree is typically of order $n^{1/2}$, the same as for the uniform spanning tree; (2) a high disorder regime with $\beta \geq n^{4/3} \log n$, where the diameter is typically of order $n^{1/3}$, the same as for the minimum spanning tree. We conjecture that for $\beta=n^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, 4/3)$, the diameter is of order $n^{\gamma+o(1)}$ for some $\gamma=\gamma(\alpha)$ strictly between $1/2$ and $1/3$.</description>

      <title>Local limits of random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the edge overlap and local limit of the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) on the complete graph with $n$ vertices and weights given by $\exp(-\beta \omega_e)$ for $\omega_e$ uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We show that for $\beta$ growing with $\beta = o(n/\log n)$, the edge overlap is $(1+o(1)) \beta$, while for $\beta$ much larger than $n \log^2 n$, the edge overlap is $(1-o(1))n$. Furthermore, there is a transition of the local limit around $\beta = n$. When $\beta = o(n/ \log n)$ the RSTRE locally converges to the same limit as the uniform spanning tree, whereas for $\beta$ larger than $n \log^\lambda n$, where $\lambda = \lambda(n) \rightarrow \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, the local limit of the RSTRE is the same as that of the minimum spanning tree.</description>

      <title>Inverse first-passage problems of a diffusion with resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address some inverse problems for the first-passage place and the first-passage time of a one-dimensional diffusion process $\mathcal X(t)$ with stochastic resetting, starting from an initial position $\mathcal X(0)= \eta ;$ this type of diffusion $\mathcal X(t)$ is characterized by the fact that a reset to the position $x_R $ can occur according to a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $r&gt;0.$ As regards the inverse first-passage place problem, for random $\eta \in (0,b), \ b &lt; + \infty$ (and fixed $r$ and $x_R \in (0,b))$, let $\tau_{0,b}$ be the first time at which $\mathcal X(t)$ exits the interval $(0,b),$ and $\pi _0 = P(\mathcal X(\tau_{0,b}) = 0)$ the probability of exit from the left end of $(0,b);$ given a probability $q \in (0,1),$ the inverse first-passage place problem consists in finding the density $g$ of $\eta ,$ if it exists, such that $\pi _0 = q.$ Concerning the inverse first-passage time problem, for random $\eta \in (0, + \infty)$ (and fixed $r$ and $x_R &gt;0)$, let $\tau$ be the first-passage time of $\mathcal X(t)$ through zero; for a given distribution function $F(t)$ on the positive real axis, the inverse first-passage time problem consists in finding the density $g$ of $\eta,$ if it exists, such that $P(\tau \le t ) = F(t), \ t &gt;0.$ In addition to the case of random initial position $\eta,$ we also study the case when the initial position $\eta$ and the resetting rate $r$ are fixed, whereas the reset position $x_R$ is random. For all types of inverse problems considered, several explicit examples of solutions are reported.</description>

Abstract: We present a method of solving a nonlinear Dirichlet problem with discontinuous boundary data and we give a probabilistic representation of the solution using the nonlocal branching process associated with the nonlinear term of the operator. Instead of the pointwise convergence of the solution to the given boundary data we use the controlled convergence which allows to have discontinuities at the boundary.</description>

      <title>An Additive-Noise Approximation to Keller-Segel-Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics: Small-Noise Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an additive-noise approximation to Keller--Segel--Dean--Kawasaki dynamics which is proposed as an approximate model to the fluctuating hydrodynamics of chemotactically interacting particles around their mean-field limit. Two parameters play a key r\^ole in the approximation: the noise intensity which captures the amplitude of these fluctuations (tending to zero as the effective system size tends to infinity) and the correlation length which represents the effective scale under consideration. Using a mixture of pathwise and probabilistic tools we obtain analogues of law of large numbers and large deviation principles in regular function spaces under restrictive relative scaling assumptions on the noise intensity and the correlation length. Using methods of singular stochastic partial differential equations we also obtain analogues of law of large numbers, central limit theorems and large deviation principles in irregular spaces of distributions under general relative scaling assumptions. We further describe consequences of these results relevant to applications of our approximation in studying continuum fluctuations of particle systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of the Largest Eigenvalue for Noncentral Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $p\times n$ independent identically distributed real Gaussian matrix with positive mean $\mu $ and variance $\sigma^2$ entries. The goal of this paper is to investigate the largest eigenvalue of the noncentral sample covariance matrix $W=XX^{T}/n$, when the dimension $p$ and the sample size $n$ both grow to infinity with the limit $p/n=c\,(0&lt;c&lt;\infty)$. Utilizing the von Mises iteration method, we derive an approximation of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}(W)$ and show that $\lambda_{1}(W)$ asymptotically has a normal distribution with expectation $p\mu^2+(1+c)\sigma^2$ and variance $4c\mu^2\sigma^2$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic sewing lemma on Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic sewing lemma recently introduced by Le~(2020) allows to construct a unique limit process from a doubly indexed stochastic process that satisfies some regularity. This lemma is stated in a given probability space on which these processes are defined. The present paper develops a version of this lemma for probability measures: from a doubly indexed family of maps on the set of probability measures that have a suitable probabilistic representation, we are able to construct a limit flow of maps on the probability measures. This result complements and improves the existing result coming from the classical sewing lemma. It is applied to the case of law-dependent jump SDEs for which we obtain weak existence result as well as the uniqueness of the marginal laws.</description>

      <title>SPDE for stochastic SIR epidemic models with infection-age dependent infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic SIR epidemic model with infection-age dependent infectivity for which a measure-valued process is used to describe the ages of infection for each individual. We establish a functional law large numbers (FLLN) and a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for the properly scaled measure-valued processes together with the other epidemic processes to describe the evolution dynamics. In the FLLN, assuming that the hazard rate function of the infection periods is bounded and the ages at time 0 of the infections of the initially infected individuals are bounded, we obtain a PDE limit for the LLN-scaled measure-valued process, for which we characterize its solution explicitly. The PDE is linear with a boundary condition given by the unique solution to a set of Volterra-type nonlinear integral equations. In the FCLT, we obtain an SPDE for the CLT-scaled measure-valued process, driven by two independent white noises coming from the infection and recovery processes. The SPDE is also linear and coupled with the solution to a system of stochastic Volterra-type linear integral equations driven by three independent Gaussian noises, one from the random infection functions in addition to the two white noises mentioned above. The solution to the SPDE can be also explicitly characterized, given this auxiliary process. The uniqueness of the SPDE solution is established under stronger assumptions (density and its derivative being locally bounded) on the distribution function of an infectious duration.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Risk Sensitive Control of Markovian Multiclass Many-Server Queues with Abandonment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal scheduling problem for a Markovian multiclass queueing network with abandonment in the Halfin--Whitt regime, under the long run average (ergodic) risk sensitive cost criterion. The objective is to prove asymptotic optimality for the optimal control arising from the corresponding ergodic risk sensitive control (ERSC) problem for the limiting diffusion. In particular, we show that the optimal ERSC value associated with the diffusion-scaled queueing process converges to that of the limiting diffusion in the asymptotic regime. The challenge that ERSC poses is that one cannot express the ERSC cost as an expectation over the mean empirical measure associated with the queueing process, unlike in the usual case of a long run average (ergodic) cost. We develop a novel approach by exploiting the variational representations of the limiting diffusion and the Poisson-driven queueing dynamics, which both involve certain auxiliary controls. The ERSC costs for both the diffusion-scaled queueing process and the limiting diffusion can be represented as the integrals of an extended running cost over a mean empirical measure associated with the corresponding extended processes using these auxiliary controls. For the lower bound proof, we exploit the connections of the ERSC problem for the limiting diffusion with a two-person zero-sum stochastic differential game. We also make use of the mean empirical measures associated with the extended limiting diffusion and diffusion-scaled processes with the auxiliary controls. One major technical challenge in both lower and upper bound proofs, is to establish the tightness of the aforementioned mean empirical measures for the extended processes. We identify nearly optimal controls appropriately in both cases so that the existing ergodicity properties of the limiting diffusion and diffusion-scaled queueing processes can be used.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Means in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there exists a well-developed asymptotic theory of Fr\'echet means of random variables taking values in a general "finite-dimensional" metric space, there are only a few known results in which the random variables can take values in an "infinite-dimensional" metric space. Presently, show that a natural setting for the study of probabilistic aspects of Fr\'echet means is that of metric spaces which admit a suitably powerful notion of "weak convergence". This allows us to recover, strengthen, and generalize virtually all known asymptotic theory for Fr\'echet means; in particular, we expand the possible geometric settings where such theorems can be applied, we reduce the moment assumptions to the provably minimal possible, and we completely remove assumption about uniqueness of the Fr\'echet mean. We also analyze many examples.</description>

      <title>Classical patterns in Mallows permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical pattern counts in Mallows random permutations with parameters $(n,q_n)$, as $n\to\infty$. We focus on three different regimes for the parameter $q = q_n$. When $n^{3/2}(1-q)\to0$, we use coupling techniques to prove that pattern counts in Mallows random permutations satisfy a central limit theorem with the same asymptotic mean and variance as in uniformly random permutations. When $q\to1$ and $n(1-q)\to\infty$, we use results on the displacements of permutation points to find the order of magnitude of pattern counts. When $q\in(0,1)$ is fixed, we use the regenerative property of the Mallows distribution to compare pattern counts with certain $U$-statistics, and establish central limit theorems. We also construct a specific Mallows process, that is a coupling of Mallows distributions with $q$ ranging from $0$ to $1$, for which the process of pattern counts satisfies a functional central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Infinite Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>

      <title>Weighted $L_\infty$ Asymptotic Characterisation of Perturbed Autonomous Linear Ordinary and Stochastic Differential Equations: Part I -- ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a two-part paper which determines necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotic behaviour of forcing functions so that the solutions of additively pertubed linear differential equations obey certain growth or decay estimates. Part I considers deterministic equations, and part II It\^o-type stochastic differential equations. Results from part I are used to deal with deterministically and stochastically forced equations in the second part. Results apply to both scalar and multi-dimensional equations, and connect the asymptotic behaviour of time averages of the forcing terms on finite intervals with the growth or decay rate of the solution. Mainly, results deal with large perturbations, but some indications of how results extend to tackle subdominant perturbations are also sketched.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the asymptotic behaviour of deterministically and stochastically forced linear pantograph equations. The asymptotic behaviour is studied in the case when all solutions of the pantograph equation without forcing tend to a trivial equilibrium. In all cases, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the forcing terms which enable all solutions to converge to the equilibrium of the unforced equation, and which enable solutions to remain bounded. In the deterministic case, we give sharp conditions on forcing terms which enable the solutions of the forced equations to inherit the power law behaviour of the unforced equation, as well as slower rates of decay or growth not present in the unforced equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo matrix trace estimation is a popular randomized technique to estimate the trace of implicitly-defined matrices via averaging quadratic forms across several observations of a random vector. The most common approach to analyze the quality of such estimators is to consider the variance over the total number of observations. In this paper we present a procedure to compute the variance of the estimator proposed by Kong and Valiant [Ann. Statist. 45 (5), pp. 2218 - 2247] for the case of Gaussian random vectors and provide a sharper bound than previously available.</description>

Abstract: We consider inclusions $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$ of discrete, probability measure-preserving orbit equivalence relations. In previous work with Ab\'{e}rt-Fra\c{c}zyk, we established the pointwise almost sure existence of the cospectral radius of a random walk on the $\mathcal{R}$-classes. In this paper, we investigate the connections of this cospectral radius to the coamenability of the inclusion $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$. We also undertake a systematic study of coamenability for inclusions of relations, establishing several equivalence formulations of this notion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising from the biomathematics, which consists of a chemotaxis model with cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by virtue of the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators and cut-off functions, which makes it possible for constructing sufficiently smooth approximation solutions, and facilitating the effective use of stochastic entropy-energy estimates. Then, building on the entropy-energy estimates, we further derive some higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method permits us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic equation for arctic curves of the Aztec diamond with a doubly (quasi-)periodic weight structure and obtain similar results for certain models of the hexagon. In particular, we determine the algebraic degree of such curves as a function of the number of frozen and smooth (or gaseous) regions. The key to our result is the construction of a discriminant for meromorphic differentials on a higher genus Riemann surface. This construction works analogously for meromorphic sections of arbitrary holomorphic line bundles. In the genus $g = 0$ case this notion reduces to the usual discriminant of a polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the method of paracontrolled distributions, we show the local well-posedness of an additive noise approximation to the fluctuating hydrodynamics of the Keller-Segel model on the two-dimensional torus. Our approximation is a non-linear, non-local, parabolic-elliptic stochastic PDE with an irregular, heterogeneous space-time noise. As a consequence of the irregularity and heterogeneity, solutions to this equation must be renormalised by a sequence of diverging fields. Using the symmetry of the elliptic Green's function, which appears in our non-local term, we establish that the renormalisation diverges at most logarithmically, an improvement over the linear divergence one would expect by power counting. Similar cancellations also serve to reduce the number of diverging counterterms.</description>

Furthermore, we construct the integrated density of states of these Anderson Hamiltonians, and we relate the Lifschitz tails (the asymptotics of the left tails of the integrated density of states) to the left tails of the principal eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation for the Moving Averaged Modulus Wavelet Transform and its Variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moving average of the complex modulus of the analytic wavelet transform provides a robust time-scale representation for signals to small time shifts and deformation. In this work, we derive the Wiener chaos expansion of this representation for stationary Gaussian processes by the Malliavin calculus and combinatorial techniques. The expansion allows us to obtain a lower bound for the Wasserstein distance between the time-scale representations of two long-range dependent Gaussian processes in terms of Hurst indices. Moreover, we apply the expansion to establish an upper bound for the smooth Wasserstein distance and the Kolmogorov distance between the distributions of a random vector derived from the time-scale representation and its normal counterpart. It is worth mentioning that the expansion consists of infinite Wiener chaos and the projection coefficients converge to zero slowly as the order of the Wiener chaos increases, and we provide a rational-decay upper bound for these distribution distances, the rate of which depends on the nonlinear transformation of the amplitude of the complex wavelet coefficients.</description>

      <title>New asymptotic expansion formula via Malliavin calculus and its application to rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13405v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generic asymptotic expansion formula of expectations of multidimensional Wiener functionals through a Malliavin calculus technique. The uniform estimate of the asymptotic expansion is shown under a weaker condition on the Malliavin covariance matrix of the target Wiener functional. In particular, the method provides a tractable expansion for the expectation of an irregular functional of the solution to a multidimensional rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&lt;1/2$, without using complicated fractional integral calculus for the singular kernel. In a numerical experiment, our expansion shows a much better approximation for a probability distribution function than its normal approximation, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low temperature $(2+1)$D Solid-On-Solid model on $[[1, L ]]^2$ with zero boundary conditions and nonnegative heights (a floor at height $0$). Caputo et al. (2016) established that this random surface typically admits either $\mathfrak h $ or $\mathfrak h+1$ many nested macroscopic level line loops $\{\mathcal L_i\}_{i\geq 0}$ for an explicit $\mathfrak h\asymp \log L$, and its top loop $\mathcal L_0$ has cube-root fluctuations: e.g., if $\rho(x)$ is the vertical displacement of $\mathcal L_0$ from the bottom boundary point $(x,0)$, then $\max \rho(x) = L^{1/3+o(1)}$ over $x\in I_0:=L/2+[[-L^{2/3},L^{2/3}]]$. It is believed that rescaling $\rho$ by $L^{1/3}$ and $I_0$ by $L^{2/3}$ would yield a limit law of a diffusion on $[-1,1]$. However, no nontrivial lower bound was known on $\rho(x)$ for a fixed $x\in I_0$ (e.g., $x=\frac L2$), let alone on $\min\rho(x)$ in $I_0$, to complement the bound on $\max\rho(x)$. Here we show a lower bound of the predicted order $L^{1/3}$: for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that $\min_{x\in I_0} \rho(x) \geq \delta L^{1/3}$ with probability at least $1-\epsilon$. The proof relies on the Ornstein--Zernike machinery due to Campanino-Ioffe-Velenik, and a result of Ioffe, Shlosman and Toninelli (2015) that rules out pinning in Ising polymers with modified interactions along the boundary. En route, we refine the latter result into a Brownian excursion limit law, which may be of independent interest. We further show that in a $ K L^{2/3}\times K L^{2/3}$ box with boundary conditions $\mathfrak h-1,\mathfrak h,\mathfrak h,\mathfrak h$ (i.e., $\mathfrak h-1$ on the bottom side and $\mathfrak h$ elsewhere), the limit of $\rho(x)$ as $K,L\to\infty$ is a Ferrari--Spohn diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the question of whether the strong law of large numbers (SLLN) holds uniformly in a rich family of distributions, culminating in a distribution-uniform generalization of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund SLLN. These results can be viewed as extensions of Chung's distribution-uniform SLLN to random variables with uniformly integrable $q^\text{th}$ absolute central moments for $0 &lt; q &lt; 2$. Furthermore, we show that uniform integrability of the $q^\text{th}$ moment is both sufficient and necessary for the SLLN to hold uniformly at the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund rate of $n^{1/q - 1}$. These proofs centrally rely on novel distribution-uniform analogues of some familiar almost sure convergence results including the Khintchine-Kolmogorov convergence theorem, Kolmogorov's three-series theorem, a stochastic generalization of Kronecker's lemma, and the Borel-Cantelli lemmas. We also consider the non-identically distributed case.</description>

Abstract: First passage percolation with recovery is a process aimed at modeling the spread of epidemics. On a graph $G$ place a red particle at a reference vertex $o$ and colorless particles (seeds) at all other vertices. The red particle starts spreading a \emph{red first passage percolation} of rate $1$, while all seeds are dormant. As soon as a seed is reached by the process, it turns red and starts spreading {red first passage percolation}. All vertices are equipped with independent exponential clocks ringing at rate $\gamma&gt;0$, when a clock rings the corresponding \emph{red vertex turns black}. For $t\geq 0$, let $H_t$ and $M_t$ denote the size of the longest red path and of the largest red cluster present at time $t$. %, respectively. If $G$ is the semi-line, then for all $\gamma&gt;0$ almost surely $\limsup_{t}\frac{H_t\log\log t}{\log t}=1 $ and $\liminf_{t}H_t=0$. In contrast, if $G$ is an infinite Galton-Watson tree with offspring mean $\mathbf{m}&gt;1$ then, for all $\gamma&gt;0$, almost surely $\liminf_{t}\frac{H_t\log t}{t}\geq\mathbf{m}-1 $ and $\liminf_{t}\frac{M_t\log\log t}{t}\geq \mathbf{m}-1$, while $\limsup_{t} \frac{M_t}{e^{c t}}\leq 1$, for all $c&gt;\mathbf{m} -1$. Also, almost surely as $t\to \infty$, for all $\gamma&gt;0$ $H_t$ is of order at most $t$. Furthermore, if we restrict our attention to bounded-degree graphs, then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there is a critical value $\gamma_c&gt;0$ so that for all $\gamma&gt;\gamma_c$, almost surely $\limsup_{t}\frac{M_t}{t}\leq \varepsilon $.</description>

We show that the distribution of the infinite volume partition function $W^{\beta}_{\infty}$ displays a power-law decay, with an exponent $p^*(\beta)\in [1+\frac{2}{d},\infty)$. We also prove that the distribution of the suprema of the point-to-point and point-to-line partition functions display the same behavior. On the way to these results, we prove a technical estimate of independent interest: the $L^p$-norm of the partition function at the time when it overshoots a high value $A$ is comparable to $A$. We use this estimate to extend the validity of many recent results that were proved under the assumption that the environment is upper bounded.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the regularization by nonlinear noise for a class of partial differential equations that may only have local solutions. In particular, we obtain the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which provide positive answers to a longstanding open problem in this field.
  Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system. Our main results have broad applications, including stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic surface growth models and stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>Wright--Fisher kernels: from linear to non-linear dynamics, ergodicity and McKean--Vlasov scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population of hosts infected by a pathogen that exists in two strains. We use a two-parameter family of Markov kernels on $[0,1]$ to describe the discrete-time evolution of the pathogen type-composition within and across individuals. First, we assume that there is no interaction between pathogen populations across host individuals. For a particular class of parameters, we establish moment duality between the type-frequency process and a process reminiscent of the \emph{Ancestral Selection Graph}. We also show convergence, under appropriate scaling of parameters and time, to a Wright-Fisher diffusion with drift. Next, we assume that pathogen-type compositions are correlated across hosts by their empirical measure. We show a propagation of chaos result comparing the pathogen type-composition of a given host with the evolution of a non-linear chain. Furthermore, we show that under appropriate scaling, the non-linear chain converges to a McKean-Vlasov diffusion. To illustrate our results, we consider a population affected by mutation rates that depend on the instantaneous distribution across multiple hosts. For this example, we study the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos and the ergodicity of the limiting McKean-Vlasov SDE.</description>

Abstract: Discrete signatures are invariants computed from time series corresponding to the discretised version of the signature of paths. We study the algebraic varieties arising from their images, the discrete signature varieties. We introduce them and compute their dimension in many cases. From a particular subclass of these varieties, we derive a partial solution to the Chen-Chow theorem for complex-valued time series.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria for dividend distribution with competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Nash equilibria in feedback form for a class of two-person stochastic games of singular control with absorption, arising from a stylized model for corporate finance. More precisely, the paper focusses on a strategic dynamic game in which two financially-constrained firms operate in the same market. The firms distribute dividends and are faced with default risk. The strategic interaction arises from the fact that if one firm defaults, the other one becomes a monopolist and increases its profitability. The firms choose their dividend distribution policies from a class of randomised strategies and we identify two types of equilibria, depending on the firms' initial endowments. In both situations the optimal strategies and the equilibrium payoffs are found explicitly.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation property of Banach space-valued random feature models including random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Banach space-valued extension of random feature learning, a data-driven supervised machine learning technique for large-scale kernel approximation. By randomly initializing the feature maps, only the linear readout needs to be trained, which reduces the computational complexity substantially. Viewing random feature models as Banach space-valued random variables, we prove a universal approximation result in the corresponding Bochner space. Moreover, we derive approximation rates and an explicit algorithm to learn an element of the given Banach space by such models. The framework of this paper includes random trigonometric/Fourier regression and in particular random neural networks which are single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly initialized, whence only the linear readout needs to be trained. For the latter, we can then lift the universal approximation property of deterministic neural networks to random neural networks, even within function spaces over non-compact domains, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. In addition, we analyze when the training costs for approximating a given function grow polynomially in both the input/output dimension and the reciprocal of a pre-specified tolerated approximation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a numerical example the empirical advantages of random feature models over their deterministic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive limits beyond the Marcus regime for deterministic fast-slow systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider deterministic fast-slow dynamical systems of the form \[ x_{k+1}^{(n)} = x_k^{(n)} + n^{-1} A(x_k^{(n)}) + n^{-1/\alpha} B(x_k^{(n)}) v(y_k), \quad y_{k+1} = Ty_k, \] where $\alpha\in(1,2)$ and $x_k^{(n)}\in{\mathbb R}^m$. Here, $T$ is a slowly mixing nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical system and the process $W_n(t)=n^{-1/\alpha}\sum_{k=1}^{[nt]}v(y_k)$ converges weakly to a $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process $L_\alpha$.
  We are interested in convergence of the $m$-dimensional process $X_n(t)=x_{[nt]}^{(n)}$ to the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) \[ dX = A(X)\,dt + B(X)\, dL_\alpha. \] In the simplest cases considered in previous work, the limiting SDE has the Marcus interpretation. In particular, the SDE is Marcus if the noise coefficient $B$ is exact or if the excursions for $W_n$ converge to straight lines as $n\to\infty$.
  Outside these simplest situations, it turns out that typically the Marcus interpretation fails. We develop a general theory that does not rely on exactness or linearity of excursions. To achieve this, it is necessary to consider suitable spaces of ``decorated'' c\`adl\`ag paths and to interpret the limiting decorated SDE. In this way, we are able to cover more complicated examples such as billiards with flat cusps where the limiting SDE is typically non-Marcus for $m\ge2$.</description>

      <title>$p$-Wasserstein barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study barycenters of $N$ probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the $p$-Wasserstein metric ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$). We prove that
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters of absolutely continuous measures are unique, and again absolutely continuous
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters admit a multi-marginal formulation
  -- the optimal multi-marginal plan is unique and of Monge form if the marginals are absolutely continuous, and its support has an explicit parametrization as a graph over any marginal space.
  This extends the Agueh--Carlier theory of Wasserstein barycenters [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 43 (2011), no.2, 904--924] to exponents $p\neq 2$. A key ingredient is a quantitative injectivity estimate for the (highly non-injective) map from $N$-point configurations to their $p$-barycenter on the support of an optimal multi-marginal plan. We also discuss the statistical meaning of $p$-Wasserstein barycenters in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac Formula for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Applications in Numerical Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a Feynman-Kac formula for general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with applications in numerical approximations. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations. Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for numerical approximation. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a convergence analysis is provided to support the results.</description>

      <title>The hitting time of nice factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the random $u$-uniform hypergraph (or $u$-graph) process on $n$ vertices, where $n$ is divisible by $r&gt;u\ge 2$. It was recently shown that with high probability, as soon as every vertex is covered by a copy of the complete $u$-graph $K_r$, it also contains a $K_r$-factor (RSA, Vol. 65 II, Sept. 2024). The hitting time result is obtained using a process coupling, which is based on the proof of the corresponding sharp threshold result (RSA, Vol. 61 IV, Dec. 2022). The latter, however, was not only derived for complete $u$-graphs, but for a broader class of so-called nice $u$-graphs.
  The purpose of this article is to extend the process coupling for complete $u$-graphs to the full scope of the sharp threshold result: nice $u$-graphs. As a byproduct, we obtain the extension of the hitting time result to nice $u$-graphs. Since the relevant combinatorial bounds in the proof for the $K_r$-case cannot be generalized, we introduce new arguments that do not only apply to nice u-graphs, but will be relevant for the broader class of strictly 1-balanced u-graphs. Further, we show how the remainder of the process coupling for the $K_r$-case can be utilized in a black-box manner for any u-graph. These advances pave the way for future generalizations.</description>

      <title>Three connected problems: principal with multiple agents in cooperation, Principal--Agent with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics and multitask Principal--Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address three Principal--Agent problems in a moral hazard context and show that they are connected. We start by studying the problem of Principal with multiple Agents in cooperation. The term cooperation is manifested here by the fact that the agents optimize their criteria through Pareto equilibria. We show that as the number of agents tends to infinity, the principal's value function converges to the value function of a McKean--Vlasov control problem. Using the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem, we derive a constructive method for obtaining approximately optimal contracts for the principal's problem with multiple agents in cooperation. In a second step, we show that the problem of Principal with multiple Agents turns out to also converge, when the number of agents goes to infinity, towards a new Principal--Agent problem which is the Principal--Agent problem with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics. This is a Principal--Agent problem where the agent--controlled production follows a Mckean-Vlasov dynamics and the contract can depend of the distribution of the production. The value function of the principal in this setting is equivalent to that of the same McKean--Vlasov control problem from the multi--agent scenario. Furthermore, we show that an optimal contract can be constructed from the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem. We conclude by discussing, in a simple example, the connection of these problems with the multitask Principal--Agent problem which is a situation when a principal delegates multiple tasks that can be correlated to a single agent.</description>
