      <title>Spin relaxation in graphite due to spin-orbital-phonon interaction from first-principles density-matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict "intrinsic" spin relaxation times ($T_{1}$) of graphite due to spin-orbit-phonon interaction, i.e., the combination of spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interaction, using our developed first-principles density-matrix approach. We obtain ultralong $T_{1}$, e.g., $\sim$600 ns at 300 K, which leads to ultralong in-plane spin diffusion length $\sim$110 $\mu$m within the drift-diffusion model. Our prediction sets the upper bound of $T_{1}$ of graphite at each given temperature and Fermi level. The anisotropy ratios of $T_{1}$ or values of $T_{1z}/T_{1x}$ are found small and around 0.6. We examine the applicability of the well-known Elliot-Yafet (EY) relation, which declares that spin relaxation rate $T_{1\alpha}^{-1}$ ($\alpha=x,y,z$) is proportional to the product of the ensemble average of spin mixing parameter $\left\langle b_{\alpha}^{2}\right\rangle $ and carrier relaxation rate $\tau_{p}^{-1}$. Our numerical tests suggest that the EY relation works qualitatively if the degeneracy threshold $t^{\mathrm{deg}}$ for evaluating $b_{\alpha}^{2}$ is elatively large (not much smaller than or comparable to $k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-3}$ eV or larger, but fails if $t^{\mathrm{deg}}$ is too tiny (much smaller than $k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-6}$ eV or smaller.</description>

      <title>Finite-order method to calculate approximate density matrices in the Fock-space multireference coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient approach to calculate approximate pure-state and transition reduced density matrices in the framework of the multireference relativistic Fock-space coupled cluster (FS CC) theory is proposed. The method is based on the effective operator formalism and consists of the direct substitution of the FS CC Ansatz for a wave operator into the effective operator expression with the subsequent truncation of expansion at the terms quadratic in cluster amplitudes. The final density matrix is defined by active-space density matrices of different ranks "dressed" with contributions from cluster operators. The method gives a connected expression for pure-state density matrices, provided that the intermediate normalization condition is fulfilled. Moreover, under some additional assumptions, the connectivity can also be ensured for calculated transition property matrix elements and natural transition spinors. The developed technique allows for fast and accurate calculations of one-particle reduced density matrices for a wide range of electronic states. A pilot application of the new technique to construct averaged atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis sets for fully relativistic electronic structure calculations is presented.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular-anisotropy artificial spin ice with spontaneous ordering: a platform for neuromorphic computing with flexible timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of coupled nanomagnets have wide-ranging fundamental and practical applications in artificial spin ices, neuromorphic computing and spintronics. However, lacking in these fields are nanomagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with sufficient magnetostatic interaction. This would not only open up new possibilities for artificial spin ice geometries but also enable novel coupling methods for applications. Here we demonstrate a method to engineer the energy landscape of artificial spin lattices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. With this, we are able to realize for the first time magnetostatically-coupled 2D lattices of out-of-plane Ising spins that spontaneously order at room temperature on timescales that can be precisely engineered. We show how this property, together with straightforward electrical interfacing, make this system a promising platform for reservoir computing. Our results open the way to investigate the thermodynamics of out-of-plane magnetostatically coupled nanomagnet arrays with novel spin ice geometries, as well as to exploit such nanomagnet arrays in unconventional computing, taking advantage of the adjustable temporal dynamics and strong coupling between nanomagnets.</description>

      <title>Physics of the low momentum diffusivity regime in tokamaks and its experimental applicability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong $E\times B$ plasma flow shear is beneficial for reducing turbulent transport. However, traditional methods of driving flow shear do not scale well to large devices such as future fusion power plants. In this paper, we use a large number of nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations to study a novel approach to increase flow shear: decreasing the momentum diffusivity to make the plasma ``easier to push''. We first use an idealized circular geometry and find that one can obtain low momentum diffusivity at tight aspect ratio, low safety factor, high magnetic shear and low temperature gradient. This is the so-called Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. To drive intrinsic momentum flux, we then tilt the flux surface, making it up-down asymmetric. In the LMD regime, this intrinsic momentum flux drives strong flow shear that can significantly reduce the heat flux and increase the critical temperature gradient. We also consider the actual experimental geometry of the MAST tokamak to illustrate that this strategy can be practical and create experimentally significant flow shear. Lastly, a preliminary prediction for the SMART tokamak is made.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Atomic-Scale Pathways Driving Pressure-Induced Phase Transitions in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon exhibits several metastable allotropes which recently attracted attention in the quest for materials with superior (e.g. optical) properties, compatible with Si technology. In this work we shed light on the atomic-scale mechanisms leading to phase transformations in Si under pressure. To do so, we synergically exploit different state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we use the advanced GAP interatomic potential both in NPT molecular dynamics simulations and in solid-state nudged elastic band calculations, validating our predictions with ab initio DFT calculations.
  We provide a link between evidence reported in experimental nanoindentation literature and simulation results. Particular attention is dedicated to the investigation of atomistic transition paths allowing for the transformation between BC8/R8 phases to the hd one under pure annealing. In this case we show a direct simulation of the local nucleation of the hexagonal phase in a BC8/R8 matrix and its corresponding atomic-scale mechanism extracted by the use of SS-NEB. We extend our study investigating the effect of pressure on the nucleation barrier, providing an argument for explaining the heterogeneous nucleation of the hd phase observed in experiments reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Non-universality for Crossword Puzzle Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A percolation model inspired by crossword puzzle games is introduced. A game proceeds by solving words, which are segments of sites in a two-dimensional lattice. As test case, the \emph{iid} variant allows for independently occupying sites with letters, only the percolation criterion depends on the existence of solved words. For the \emph{game} variant, inspired by real crossword puzzles, it becomes more likely to solve crossing words which share sites with the already solved words. In this way avalanches of solved words may occur. Both model variants exhibit a percolation transition as function of the a-priori site or word solving probability, respectively. The \emph{iid} variant is in the universality class of standard two-dimensional percolation. The \emph{game} variant exhibits a non-universal critical exponent $\nu$ of the correlation length. The actual value of $\nu$ depends on the function which controls how much solved words accelerate the solved of crossing words.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mechanisms of Solid/Liquid Interfacial Heat Transfer in the Presence of a Meniscus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ molecular simulations to investigate the enhancement in thermal conductance at the solid/liquid interface in the presence of a meniscus reported previously (Klochko et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 25(4):3298-3308, 2023). We vary the solid/liquid interaction strength at Lennard-Jones interfaces for both confined liquid and meniscus systems, finding that the presence of a meniscus yields an enhancement in the interfacial thermal conductance across all wettabilities. However, the magnitude of the enhancement is found to depend on the surface wettability, initially rising monotonously for low to moderate wettabilities, followed by a sharp rise between moderate and high wettabilities. The spectral decomposition of heat flux formalism was applied to understand the nature of this phenomenon further. By computing the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the heat fluxes within both the interfacial solid and liquid, we show that the initial monotonous rise in conductance enhancement predominantly stems from a rise in the coupling of out-of-plane vibrations within both the solid and the liquid. In contrast, the subsequent sharp rise at more wetting interfaces is linked to sharp increases in the utilization of the in-plane modes of the solid and liquid. These observations result from the interplay between the solid/liquid adhesive forces and the liquid/vapor interfacial tension. Our results can aid engineers in optimizing thermal transport at realistic interfaces, which is critical to designing effective cooling solutions for electronics, among other applications.</description>

      <title>RBMD: A molecular dynamics package enabling to simulate 10 million all-atom particles in a single graphics processing unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random-batch molecular dynamics (RBMD) package for fast simulations of particle systems at the nano/micro scale. Different from existing packages, the RBMD uses random batch methods for nonbonded interactions of particle systems. The long-range part of Coulomb interactions is calculated in Fourier space by the random batch Ewald algorithm, which achieves linear complexity and superscalability, surpassing classical lattice-based Ewald methods. For the short-range part, the random batch list algorithm is used to construct neighbor lists, significantly reducing both computational and memory costs. The RBMD is implemented on GPU-CPU heterogeneous architectures, with classical force fields for all-atom systems. Benchmark systems are used to validate accuracy and performance of the package. Comparison with the particle-particle particle-mesh method and the Verlet list method in the LAMMPS package is performed on three different NVIDIA GPUs, demonstrating high efficiency of the RBMD on heterogeneous architectures. Our results also show that the RBMD enables simulations on a single GPU with a CPU core up to 10 million particles. Typically, for systems of one million particles, the RBMD allows simulating all-atom systems with a high efficiency of 8.20 ms per step, demonstrating the attractive feature for running large-scale simulations of practical applications on a desktop machine.</description>

      <title>Hairygami: Analysis of DNA Nanostructures' Conformational Change Driven by Functionalizable Overhangs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA origami is a widely used method to construct nanostructures by self-assembling designed DNA strands. These structures are often used as "pegboards" for templated assembly of proteins, gold nanoparticles, aptamers, and other molecules, with applications ranging from therapeutics and diagnostics to plasmonics and photonics.
  Imaging these structures using AFM or TEM does not capture their full conformation ensemble as they only show their shape flattened on a surface. However, certain conformations of the nanostructure can position guest molecules into distances unaccounted for in their intended design, thus leading to spurious interactions between guest molecules that are designed to be separated. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to capture conformational ensemble of 2D DNA origami tiles and show that introducing single-stranded overhangs, which are typically used for functionalization of the origami with guest molecules, induces a curvature of the tile structure in the bulk. We show that the shape deformation is of entropic origin, with implications for design of robust DNA origami breadboards as well as potential approach to modulate structure shape by introducing overhangs. We then verify experimentally that the DNA overhangs introduce curvature into the DNA origami tiles in divalent as well as monovalent salt buffer conditions. We further experimentally verify that DNA origami functionalized with attached proteins also experience such induced curvature. We provide the developed simulation code implementing the enhanced sampling to characterize conformational space of DNA origami as open source software.</description>

Abstract: The precise control of complex reactions is critical for biological processes yet our inability to design for specific outcomes limits the development of synthetic analogues. Here, we leverage differentiable simulators to design nontrivial reaction pathways in colloidal assemblies. By optimizing over external structures, we achieve controlled disassembly and particle release from colloidal shells. Lastly, we characterize the role of configurational entropy in the structure via both forward calculations and optimization, inspiring new parameterizations of designed colloidal reactions.</description>

      <title>Circle packing on spherical caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the packing of congruent disks on a spherical cap, for caps of different size and number of disks, $N$. This problem has been considered before only in the limit cases of circle packing inside a circle and on a sphere (Tammes problem), whereas all intermediate cases are unexplored. Finding the preferred packing configurations for a domain with both curvature and border could be useful in the description of physical and biological systems (for example, colloidal suspensions or the compound eye of an insect), with potential applications in engineering and architecture (e.g. geodesic domes).
  We have carried out an extensive search for the densest packing configurations of congruent disks on spherical caps of selected angular widths ($\theta_{\rm max} = \pi/6$, $\pi/4$, $\pi/2$, $3\pi/4$, $5 \pi/6$) and for several values of $N$. The numerical results obtained in the present work have been used to establish (at least qualitatively) some general features for these configurations, in particular the behavior of the packing fraction as function of the number of disks and of the angular width of the cap, or the nature of the topological defects in these configurations (it found that as the curvature increases the overall topological on the border tends to become more negative).
  Finally we have studied the packing configurations for $N = 19$, $37$, $61$, $91$ (hexagonal numbers) for caps ranging from the flat disk to the whole sphere, to observe the evolution (and eventual disappearance) of the curved hexagonal packing configurations while increasing the curvature.</description>
