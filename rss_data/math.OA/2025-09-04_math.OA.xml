      <title>A trace pairing and Elliott invariant for groupoid homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an \'{e}tale groupoid, we define a pairing between the Crainic-Moerdijk groupoid homology and the simplex of invariant Borel probability measures on the base space. The main novelty here is that the groupoid need not have totally disconnected base space, and thus the pairing can give more refined information than the measures of clopen subsets of the base space.
  Our principal motivation is $C^*$-algebra theory. The Elliott invariant of a $C^*$-algebra is defined in terms of $K$-theory and traces; it is fundamental in the long-running program to classify simple $C^*$-algebras (satisfying additional necessary conditions). We use our pairing to define a groupoid Elliott invariant, and show that for many interesting groupoids it agrees with the $C^*$-algebraic Elliott invariant of the groupoid $C^*$-algebra: this includes irrational rotation algebras and the $C^*$-algebras arising from orbit breaking constructions studied by the first listed author, Putnam, and Strung. These results can be thought of as establishing a refinement of Matui's HK conjecture for the relevant groupoids.</description>

      <title>G-kernels and Crossed Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework based on topological crossed modules for various lifting obstructions for $\Gamma$-kernels. It allows us to identify actions, cocycle actions and $\Gamma$-kernels up to their natural equivalence relations with cohomology sets. The obstructions then appear as boundary maps in corresponding exact sequences. Since topological crossed modules are topological $2$-groups (in the categorical sense), they have classifying spaces, which come with a natural transformation from the cohomology to a homotopy set. For the crossed module that gives cocycle actions we prove a weak equivalence of the classifying space of the crossed module with one from bundle theory. In case the algebra is strongly self-absorbing we show that the homotopy set is a group and that the above natural transformation is a group isomorphism on an appropriate restriction of the cohomology set.</description>

      <title>Disjoint additivity and local quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems of physical interest are often local, but there are at least three competing perspectives on how "locality" should be formalized: an algebraic framework, a path-integral framework, and a lattice framework. One puzzle in this competition is that systems with higher-form symmetries, which are perfectly local from the path-integral and lattice perspectives, can violate the algebraic principle of "additivity". In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle by introducing a weaker locality principle, "disjoint additivity", which together with Haag duality should always be satisfied in local quantum systems. As evidence, we give examples in which disjoint additivity is preserved when ordinary additivity is violated; we show that Haag duality and disjoint additivity are satisfied in rather general lattice systems with local symmetry constraints; we give examples of nonlocal theories in which either disjoint additivity or Haag duality is violated; and finally we give examples of systems with nonlocal symmetry constraints in which disjoint additivity is violated, but can be restored by passing to a local "SymTFT" system in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>The Global Glimm Property for C*-algebras of topological dimension zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a C*-algebra with topological dimension zero has the Global Glimm Property (every hereditary subalgebra contains an almost full nilpotent element) if and only if it is nowhere scattered (no hereditary subalgebra admits a finite-dimensional representation). This solves the Global Glimm Problem in this setting.
  It follows that nowhere scattered C*-algebras with finite nuclear dimension and topological dimension zero are pure.</description>
