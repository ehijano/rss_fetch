      <title>Three Pillars Towards Next-Generation Routing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The routing results are playing an increasingly important role in transportation efficiency, but they could generate traffic congestion unintentionally. This is because the traffic condition and routing system are disconnected components in the current routing paradigm. In this paper, we propose a next-generation routing paradigm that could reduce traffic congestion by considering the influence of the routing results in real-time. Specifically, we regard the routing results as the root cause of the future traffic flow, which at the same time is identified as the root cause of traffic conditions. To implement such a system, we identify three essential components: 1) the traffic condition simulation that establishes the relation between traffic flow and traffic condition with guaranteed accuracy; 2) the future route management that supports efficient simulation with dynamic route update; 3) the global routing optimization that improves the overall transportation system efficiency. Preliminary design and experimental results will be presented, and the corresponding challenges and research directions will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is a recent, purely forward-mode learning method, that updates weights locally and layer-wise and supports supervised as well as unsupervised learning. These features make it ideal for applications such as brain-inspired learning, low-power hardware neural networks, and distributed learning in large models. However, while FF has shown promise on written digit recognition tasks, its performance on natural images and time-series remains a challenge. A key limitation is the need to generate high-quality negative examples for contrastive learning, especially in unsupervised tasks, where versatile solutions are currently lacking. To address this, we introduce the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) method, inspired by self-supervised contrastive learning. SCFF generates positive and negative examples applicable across different datasets, surpassing existing local forward algorithms for unsupervised classification accuracy on MNIST (MLP: 98.7%), CIFAR-10 (CNN: 80.75%), and STL-10 (CNN: 77.3%). Additionally, SCFF is the first to enable FF training of recurrent neural networks, opening the door to more complex tasks and continuous-time video and text processing.</description>

      <title>Retrieve, Annotate, Evaluate, Repeat: Leveraging Multimodal LLMs for Large-Scale Product Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating production-level retrieval systems at scale is a crucial yet challenging task due to the limited availability of a large pool of well-trained human annotators. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to address this scaling issue and offer a viable alternative to humans for the bulk of annotation tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework for assessing the product search engines in a large-scale e-commerce setting, leveraging Multimodal LLMs for (i) generating tailored annotation guidelines for individual queries, and (ii) conducting the subsequent annotation task. Our method, validated through deployment on a large e-commerce platform, demonstrates comparable quality to human annotations, significantly reduces time and cost, facilitates rapid problem discovery, and provides an effective solution for production-level quality control at scale.</description>

      <title>CEF: Connecting Elaborate Federal QKD Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As QKD infrastructure becomes increasingly complex while being developed by different actors (typically national governments), interconnecting them into a federated network of very elaborate sub-networks that maintain a high degree of autonomy will pose unique challenges. We identify several such challenges and propose a 4-step orchestration framework to address them based on centralized research, target network planning, optimal QKD design, and protocol enforcement.</description>

      <title>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>WAGONN: Weight Bit Agglomeration in Crossbar Arrays for Reduced Impact of Interconnect Resistance on DNN Inference Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) accelerators employing crossbar arrays capable of in-memory computing (IMC) are highly promising for neural computing platforms. However, in deeply scaled technologies, interconnect resistance severely impairs IMC robustness, leading to a drop in the system accuracy. To address this problem, we propose SWANN - a technique based on shuffling weights in crossbar arrays which alleviates the detrimental effect of wire resistance on IMC. For 8T-SRAM-based 128x128 crossbar arrays in 7nm technology, SWANN enhances the accuracy from 47.78% to 83.5% for ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. We also show that SWANN can be used synergistically with Partial-Word-LineActivation, further boosting the accuracy. Moreover, we evaluate the implications of SWANN for compact ferroelectric-transistorbased crossbar arrays. SWANN incurs minimal hardware overhead, with less than a 1% increase in energy consumption. Additionally, the latency and area overheads of SWANN are ~1% and ~16%, respectively when 1 ADC is utilized per crossbar array.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling 5G-NTN Satellite Communications for Manned and Unmanned Rotary Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite Communications (SatCom) are a backbone of worldwide development. In contrast with the past, when the GEO satellites were the only means for such connectivity, nowadays the multi-orbital connectivity is emerging, especially with the use of satellite constellations. Simultaneously, SatCom enabled the so-called In-Flight Connectivity, while with the advent of 5G-NTN, the development of this market is being accelerated. However, there are still various missing points before such a technology becomes mainstream, especially in the case of Rotary Wing Aircraft (RWA). Indeed, due to their particular characteristics, such as the low altitude flights and the blade interference, there are still open challenges. In this work, an End-to-End (E2E) analysis for the performance of SatCom under 5G-NTN for manned and unmanned RWA is performed. Various scenarios are examined, and related requirements are shown. The effects of blades and other characteristics of the RWA are established, and simulations for these cases are developed. Results along with related discussion are presented, while future directions for development are suggested. This work is part of the ESA ACROSS-AIR project.</description>
