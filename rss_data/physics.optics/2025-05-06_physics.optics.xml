      <title>Exploring Metamaterial Lasers through Non-Hermitian Scattering Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the exciting properties of metamaterials and their innovative applications in non-Hermitian physics, with particular emphasis on the scattering formalism, a key topic of recent research. We have analyzed how light behaves in a negative index metamaterial (NIM), allowing us to develop a transfer matrix and identify the essential conditions for the occurrence of spectral singularities. These findings are crucial for fine-tuning system parameters that will drive the development of metamaterial slab lasers and coherent perfect absorber (CPA) systems. Overall, our research demonstrates the enormous potential of metamaterials and their significant role in driving innovation in various technology areas.</description>

      <title>Fully Integrated Vacuum-based Quantum Random Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random number generators play a crucial role in securing high-demand information contexts by producing true random numbers. Nevertheless, the large volume and high-cost limit their widespread use. Here, we propose a system on chip that fully leverages the advantages of different photonic integrated platforms, where the interference optical paths and photodiodes are integrated on a standard silicon process, while the laser source on-chip is realized on a III-V platform. Using micro-lens coupling package technology, which contributes to a topnotch coupling loss lower than 2dB, the components on different platforms are combined and packaged with the amplifier circuits in a 42mm* 24mm footprint in a butterfly form. This complete miniaturized and cost-effective entropy source enables outputting a vacuum noise signal with a 3dB bandwidth of over 500MHz. After sampling and post-processing, a random number generation rate of up to 6.57Gbps is achieved. The results show a feasible way of overcoming the laser integration problem with silicon-based integrated quantum photonics. Foreseeable, commercial applications on a large scale are significantly promoted.</description>

      <title>All-fiber highly efficient delivery of 2 kW laser over 2.45 km hollow-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-resonant hollow-core fibers (AR-HCFs) have emerged as an important medium for high-power laser delivery due to their low optical nonlinearity and high damage threshold. However, current delivery systems of high-power laser based on AR-HCFs mainly rely on free-space optical components, which limits long-term stability in dynamic environments. Here, we report an all-fiber delivery of 2 kW laser with 85.3% transmission efficiency over 2.45 km, using a self-fabricated AR-HCF with a record low transmission loss of 0.175 dB/km at 1080 nm. This represents a nearly 500-fold improvement in the power-distance product compared to reported all-fiber AR-HCF-based laser transmission systems, achieving a record transmission distance for high-power laser delivery. Notably, we observed the phenomenon of stimulated Raman scattering amplified within the silica nested tubes in AR-HCF for the first time. By effectively suppressing the Raman noise from the laser source, we achieve an all-fiber laser delivery without stimulated Raman scattering of silica glass. This work marks a significant breakthrough in multi-kilometer and multi-kilowatt power delivery that is potentially useful for industrial manufacturing, nuclear decommissioning, laser drilling of oil, particle acceleration and so on.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Perfectly-Matched Metamaterials Via Circuit-Based Surrogate Models and the Adjoint Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, perfectly-matched metamaterials (PMMs) are described and combined with inverse design to realize broadband devices. PMMs are discretized metamaterials with anisotropic unit cells selected from a constrained design space, referred to as perfectly-matched media. PMMs exhibit the unique property that all their unit cells are impedance-matched to each other as well as to the host medium they are embedded within under all excitations. As a result, PMM devices rely on reflectionless refractive effects to achieve a prescribed function. This property enables true time delay performance and promises broadband capabilities. Two design examples are presented to demonstrate the potential of inverse-designed PMMs: a compact, broadband beam-collimator with a prescribed amplitude taper and a multi-input multi-output beamformer exhibiting zero scan loss.</description>

      <title>Roughness-Limited Performance in Ultra-Low-Loss Lithium Niobate Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01913v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving low optical loss is critical for scaling complex photonic systems. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) offers strong electro-optic and nonlinear properties in a compact platform, making it ideal for quantum and nonlinear optics. While $Q$ factors above $10^7$ have been achieved, they remain below the intrinsic material limit. We present a systematic study of scattering losses due to roughness in TFLN racetrack cavities, isolating contributions from sidewall and interface roughness. Quality factors up to $27 \times 10^6$ are demonstrated in waveguides with widths of $2.2\lambda$ ($\sim3.5\,\mu$m), where interface roughness dominates, and up to $1.2 \times 10^7$ in narrower waveguides $0.8\lambda$ wide ($\sim1.2\,\mu$m), where sidewall roughness is the primary limitation. Our modeling framework, based on 3D wave simulations informed by AFM-measured roughness, is material-independent and broadly applicable across integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum and dynamics of off-axis vortex light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light and optical vortices are closely related concepts that are often conflated. The conserved OAM arises fundamentally from the SO(3) rotational symmetry of spacetime, while the concept of vortices originates from fluid mechanics. In this work, we investigate the OAM of off-axis vortex light to clarify the distinction between the two concepts. We also examine the propagation of vortex beams, revealing the dynamic behavior of both the off-axis vortex center and photon flux within the transverse plane. This helps us explore the fundamental differences between the OAM quantum number and the vortex topological charge (TC).</description>

      <title>Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include color shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies -- for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces in Adaptive Optics: A New Opportunity in Optical Wavefront Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past fifty years, wavefront sensing technology has continuously evolved from basic techniques to high-precision systems, serving as a core methodology in adaptive optics (AO). Beyond traditional wavefront retrieval methods based on spot displacement, direct phase retrieval techniques with greater accuracy have emerged, jointly driving advancements in wavefront sensing precision. This evolution is fueled by increasing demands for accuracy, which have prompted iterative upgrades in system architectures and algorithms. Recently, breakthroughs in metasurface technology have opened new possibilities for wavefront sensing. By utilizing subwavelength microstructures, metasurfaces enable multi-dimensional control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light fields. Their high degree of design flexibility presents transformative opportunities for advancing wavefront sensing capabilities. This review examines the fundamental principles of wavefront sensing and the development of key enabling devices, highlighting how metasurface technology is reshaping traditional paradigms. We discuss recent research progress and emerging innovations, aiming to establish a theoretical framework for next-generation wavefront sensing technologies. Ultimately, we hope this review provides technical insights for applications in astronomical observation, biological microscopy, laser engineering, and beyond.</description>

      <title>High-Order Harmonic Generation in Organic Molecular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is a powerful tool for probing electronic structure and ultrafast dynamics in matter. Traditionally studied in atomic and molecular gases, HHG has recently been extended to condensed matter, enabling all-optical investigations of electronic and crystal structures. Here, we experimentally demonstrate HHG in a new class of materials: thin organic molecular crystals with perfectly aligned molecules, using pentacene as a model system. Organic molecular crystals, characterized by weak intermolecular coupling, flat electronic bands, and large unit cells, differ fundamentally from conventional covalent or ionic crystals and have attracted significant interest as promising candidates for organic electronics. We show that pentacene crystals endure laser intensities sufficient for efficient HHG up to the 17th order. The harmonic yield as a function of laser polarization reveals a strong dependence on intermolecular interactions, with higher harmonic orders particularly sensitive to both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor couplings. Model calculations indicate that weaker intermolecular interactions necessitate probing with higher harmonic orders to resolve the crystal structure. These findings suggest that HHG may serve as a powerful tool for probing the electronic structure of organic molecular crystals, enhancing all-optical techniques for studying electronic properties and ultrafast dynamics in complex organic materials.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic structures on polycarbonate via UV femtosecond pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on bulk polycarbonate (PC) using 258 nm femtosecond laser pulses. A systematic approach was pursued to investigate the influence of various laser parameters such as fluence, effective number of pulses, energy dose and polarisation on the features of the generated LIPSS. Experimental results showed that linearly polarized beams produce LIPSS with period comparable to the laser wavelength. Moreover, it was observed that the orientation of LIPSS is either parallel or perpendicular to the laser polarization, depending on the excitation level. These features are similar to the LIPSS formed on dielectrics, despite the considerably higher absorption and larger extinction coefficient (~10-2) of polycarbonate at 258 nm. The orientation and features of the patterns at different excitation levels are explained using Sipe's theory, while the excitation and induced carrier densities were quantified through the application of a theoretical physical model that describes ultrafast dynamics in polymers. Furthermore, observations revealed that low excitation levels with linearly polarized enhance the uniformity of LIPSS, whereas irradiating PC targets with circularly polarized beams leads to the formation of microscale topographies decorated with protruding nanosphered-like structures, with their size varying based on the laser conditions. A detailed analysis of the impact of the induced topographies on their wetting and optical properties demonstrated a steady increase in hydrophilicity over time, in contrast to a modest increase in optical absorbance. The results regarding the morphological features and properties of the induced topographies on PC are anticipated to support future efforts in creating patterned surfaces on polymeric materials for potential applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled surface plasmon and resonant optical tunnelling in symmetric optical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetrical structure consisting of a low refractive index dielectric layer between two metallic films, i.e. an optical cavity, surrounded by a semi-infinite dielectric medium of higher refractive index, forms an optical system capable of supporting both volume and surface resonances. The latter are associated with synchronized collective electronic oscillations in the inner surfaces of the two thin metallic films, called coupled surface plasmons. These oscillations are generated by an evanescent wave in the cavity and therefore the thickness of the cavity is limited to the micron range for visible radiation. Under suitable incident conditions, light propagating in the microcavity will resonate with these plasmonic oscillations and can be strongly transmitted into the surrounding medium. In this work, we establish a simple model of the transmission characteristics of the cavity and define resonance conditions that allow high transmittance even for inner dielectric layer thicknesses of various wavelengths. This phenomenon is an enhanced version of the optical process of frustrated total reflection between dielectrics analogous to quantum tunnelling effect. In the present situation, the phenomenon is more striking because it takes place in a system with two absorbing metal films which, under resonant conditions, favour a superior transmission.</description>

      <title>Novel Long-Wave Near-Infrared Fluorescence Bands in Tricarbocyanine Dyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-wave near-infrared (LWNIR) dyes have garnered significant attention, particularly in biomedical applications, due to their ability to enhance light absorption, making them highly effective for in vivo imaging and phototherapy. Among these dyes, cyanines are notable for their broad tunability across the ultraviolet (UV) to LWNIR spectrum and their ability to form J-aggregates, which result in narrow absorption and enhanced emission peaks, often accompanied by a red-shift in their spectra. In this study, we investigate the fluorescence properties of three known tricarbocyanine dyes, uncovering new emission bands in the LWNIR region. These dyes exhibit two distinct fluorescence peaks between 1605 and 1840 nm, with an emission tail extending up to ~2200 nm. The intensity of these peaks varies depending on dye concentration. Furthermore, we assess the photostability, pH sensitivity, and thermal stability of the dyes, providing key insights into their potential for stable and efficient biomedical applications. Our study provides a deep investigation of the spectral characteristics of these dyes, seeking to enhance their potential application in biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of self-frequency-shifting Raman quasi-solitons in a fiber Fabry-Perot resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of self-frequency-shifting Raman quasi-solitons in a pulse-pumped high-Q fiber Fabry-Perot resonator in the weak normal dispersion regime. They are induced by modulation instability mediated by fourth-order dispersion in a regime where the Raman gain overwhelms the cavity losses. The resulting spectrum, spanning over 50 THz, is reminiscent of the supercontinuum generated in single-pass waveguides. For the first time to our knowledge, we clearly identify this process using a dispersive Fourier transform experiment. Additionally, we demonstrate the suppression of modulation instability by tuning the synchronization mismatch between the pump repetition rate and the cavity roundtrip time, enabling the generation of a standard dissipative Kerr soliton in this system. These observations align remarkably well with numerical simulations based on a generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation, incorporating the Raman response of the optical fiber.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Compact Silicon Nitride Devices for High-Density Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic devices made of silicon nitride (SiN), which can be integrated with silicon on insulator and III V platforms, are expected to drive the expansion of silicon photonics technology. SiN offers lower propagation losses and a broad transparency window compared to other platforms, enabling substantial advancements in key photonic devices, including filters, multiplexers, high Q resonators, and nonlinear components. However, the relatively low refractive index contrast of SiN is often considered a limitation for creating compact and efficient devices. Herein, we present three fundamental devices: a coarse wavelength division multiplexer, a five mode mode division multiplexer, and a polarization beam splitter, all with extremely compact footprints. By achieving a reduction in device footprint of up to 1200 times, this work demonstrates the potential for significantly enhancing component density in silicon nitride chips without sacrificing performance. These results show that inverse design techniques can yield state of the art performance on the SiN platform.</description>

      <title>Exceptional, but Separate: Precursors to Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and exceptional points (EPs) are often assumed to be inherently linked. Here we investigate the intricate relationship between SSB and specific classes of EPs across three distinct, real-world scenarios in nonlinear optics. In these systems, the two phenomena do not coincide for all classes of EPs; they can occur at dislocated points in parameter space. This recurring behavior across disparate platforms implies that such decoupling is not unique to these optical systems, but likely reflects a more general principle. Our results highlight the need for careful analysis of assumed correlations between SSB and EPs in both theoretical and applied contexts. They deepen our understanding of nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and prompt a broader reconsideration of contexts where EPs and SSB are thought to be interdependent.</description>

      <title>Goos-Hanchen Shift and Slow Light Enhancement in a Fixed Cavity: Bose-Einstein Condensate Bogoliubov Modes as Mechanical Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamics of slow and fast light propagation in a system consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) acting as a mechanical oscillator coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) within a fixed-mirror cavity. The system's response is investigated through a comprehensive analysis of the transmission spectrum, output probe field characteristics (real and imaginary components), group delay, and Goos-H\"anchen shift (GHS). Our findings reveal that variations in the effective coupling strength and the OPA gain have a profound impact on the system's behavior. Specifically, as the OPA gain increases, a Fano-like resonance emerges, enhancing the transparency window and altering the dispersion, which in turn influences the group delay. The GHS is shown to be sensitive to both the incident angle and the BEC-cavity coupling strength. These results offer valuable insights into the intricate interplay between the probe field, the mechanical oscillator, and the amplified modes of the OPA, highlighting the role of these interactions in shaping the propagation of light in such systems.</description>

      <title>Spacing and Wavelength Tunable Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs are increasingly used in applications such as optical communications, radio signal processing, and dual-comb spectroscopy. Many of these applications require a broad, flat spectrum with tunable center wavelength and tone spacing, while maintaining a consistent spectral profile. However, most existing OFC generators either lack tunability or cannot preserve their spectral shape during tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate a cavity-less OFC system based on an electro-optic comb combined with parametric spectral broadening, achieving tone spacing tunability from 25 to 32 GHz and wavelength tunability from 1548 to 1568 nm. Our OFC features high output power (greater than 2 W), broad bandwidth (greater than 90 nm), high optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR greater than 25 dB), and, critically, a preserved spectral profile. We show that this consistent spectral shape can be maintained by primarily adjusting the RF drive power and the gain of the optical amplifiers. We also provide a quantitative analysis of the spectral profile variations during tuning.</description>

      <title>Microwave-field quantum metrology with error correction enabled by Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieve a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here we combine capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and to be used for quantum information processing to largely overcome the issue of detection losses. While using the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $39\ \mathrm{nV}/\mathrm{cm}\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity we employ the inter-atomic dipolar interactions to execute an error-correction protocol, that protects sensing information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the idea of the protocol is based on introduction of additional non-linear lossy quantum channel, which results in enhancement of Fisher information by a factor of 3.3. The presented results open up a path towards broader usage of quantum-information-inspired error correction in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</description>

      <title>A low-loss, 24-mode laser-written universal photonic processor in a glass-based platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of the first 24-mode universal photonic processor (UPP) realized through femtosecond laser writing (FLW), marking the most complex UPP demonstrated to date. Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.5 %. This work establishes FLW-based integrated photonics as a scalable and robust platform for advancing quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Bounds of Wavefront Shaping of Spatially Entangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables control of classical light through scattering media. Extending these techniques to spatially entangled photons promises new quantum applications, but their fundamental limits, especially when both photons scatter, remain unclear. Here, we theoretically and numerically investigate the enhancement of two-photon correlations through thick scattering media. We analyze configurations where a spatial light modulator shapes one or both photons, either before or after the medium, and show that the optimal enhancement differs fundamentally from classical expectations. For a system with $N$ modes, we show that shaping one photon yields the classical enhancement $\eta \approx (\pi/4)N$, while shaping both photons before the medium reduces it to $\eta \approx (\pi/4)^2N$. However, in some symmetric detection schemes, when both photons are measured at the same mode, perfect correlations are restored with $\eta \approx N$, resembling digital optical phase conjugation. Conversely, shaping both photons after the medium leads to a complex, NP-hard-like optimization problem, yet achieves superior enhancements, up to $\eta \approx 4.6N$. These results reveal unique quantum effects in complex media and identify strategies for quantum imaging and communication through scattering environments.</description>

      <title>Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging due to their momentum mismatch with photons and energy mismatch with plasmons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that graphene's ability to sustain a high bias and support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population enables near-infrared SPP generation in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of undoped monolayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and silver (Ag). We show that this mechanism requires neither optical gratings nor electron tunneling to produce non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission, which is uniform along the Ag-hBN interface and achieves an internal conversion efficiency of up to $10^{-3}$ with the Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology and cryptography can be combined in a distributed and/or remote sensing setting, where distant end-users with limited quantum capabilities can employ quantum states, transmitted by a quantum-powerful provider via a quantum network, to perform quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in a private fashion. Previous works on the subject have been limited by restricted assumptions on the capabilities of a potential eavesdropper and the use of abort-based protocols that prevent a simple practical realization. Here we introduce, theoretically analyze, and experimentally demonstrate single- and two-way protocols for distributed sensing combining several unique and desirable features: (i) a safety-threshold mechanism that allows the protocol to proceed in low-noise cases and quantifying the potential tampering with respect to the ideal estimation procedure, effectively paving the way for wide-spread practical realizations; (ii) equivalence of entanglement-based and mutually-unbiased-bases-based formulations; (iii) robustness against collective attacks via a LOCC-de-Finetti theorem, for the first time to our knowledge. Finally, we demonstrate our protocols in a photonic-based implementation, observing that the possibility of guaranteeing a safety threshold may come at a significant price in terms of the estimation bias, potentially overestimating the effect of tampering in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Estimations of lung structural properties from a single propagation-based dark-field X-ray image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this investigation, we applied a single-projection dark-field imaging technique to gain statistical information on the smallest airway structures within the lung$\unicode{x2014}$the alveoli$\unicode{x2014}$focusing on their size and number as key indicators of lung health. The algorithm employed here retrieves the projected thickness of the sample from a propagation-based phase contrast image using the transport-of-intensity equation. The first Born approximation is then used to isolate the dark-field signal associated with edge scattering, which increases the visibility of microstructure boundaries. PMMA spheres of known sizes were imaged first as an idealised alveolar model. The dark-field signal was then recovered from propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray images of the lungs of small mammals using this method. The retrieved dark-field signal was found to be proportional to both the alveolar size ($R^2 = 0.85$) and the number in projection ($R^2 = 0.69$), and these measurements could be combined to provide an estimate of the total surface area of the alveolar interfaces ($R^2 = 0.78$). This demonstrates the approach's ability to indicate lung health using the dark-field signal retrieved from a single-phase-contrast X-ray image.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Hermitian, nonlocal parametric pairing processes can induce non-Hermitian topology and skin modes, offering a simple alternative to complex bath engineering. Our model, stabilized by local dissipation and operating in the continuum limit, reveals exceptional points that spawn a tilted diabolical line in the dispersion. Local dissipation prevents instabilities, while a bulk anomaly signals unscreened current response. Upon opening the boundaries, we observe a non-Hermitian skin effect with localized edge modes. Through bulk winding indices and non-Bloch theory, we establish a robust bulk-boundary correspondence, highlighting parametric drives as a scalable route to non-Hermitian topology in bosonic systems.</description>

Abstract: High harmonic spectra generated in condensed matter carry the fingerprints of sub-cycle electronic motion and the energy structure of the studied system. Here we show that tailoring the waveform of mid-infrared driving light by using a coherent combination with its third harmonic frequency allows to control the time of electron tunneling to the conduction band within each half-cycle of the fundamental wave with attosecond precision. We introduce an experimental scheme in which we simultaneously monitor the modulation of amplitude and emission delays of high harmonic radiation and the excited electron population generated in crystalline silicon as a function of the relative phase between the $\omega$-3$\omega$ fields. We observe that the mutual $\omega$-3$\omega$ phase required for the maximum yield of high harmonic generation is shifted by approximately $\pi/2$ with respect to the phase leading to maximal generated carrier population. The observed emission delays of high harmonic photons of up to few hundred attoseconds scale with the time delay and with the ratio between the electric field amplitudes of the two-color fields. These results reveal the connection between electron tunneling and high harmonic emission processes in solids.</description>

Abstract: The study of coupled networks with parametric amplification of the vacuum fluctuations has garnered increasing interest due to its intricate physics and potential applications. In these systems, parametric interactions lead to beam-splitter coupling and two-mode squeezing, creating quadrature-dependent dynamics. These systems can be modeled as bosonic networks, arrays or lattices, exhibiting exotic effects such as unidirectional amplification and non-Hermitian chiral transport which influence multimode squeezing. However, exploring and controlling these network dynamics experimentally in all-optical systems remains challenging. Recent advancements in integrated nonlinear micro-resonators, known as Kerr microcombs, enable the generation and control of broadband high-repetition pulses on microchips. Kerr microcombs exhibit intriguing nonlinear dynamics, where coherent photons occupy discrete spectral lines, leading to multimode squeezed vacuum states. In this work, we explore the lattice dynamics of vacuum fluctuations driven by dissipative Kerr microcombs. We design a photonic chip where a spontaneously emergent pair of pulses creates extended multimode states of parametrically amplified vacuum fluctuations. These states exhibit oscillatory dynamics, with implications on squeezing and secondary comb formation. By employing integrated micro-heaters, we tune the vacuum fluctuations to eliminate the oscillations, establishing a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian lattice symmetries and Kerr combs, paving the way for exotic quadrature-dependent optical networks with broad implications for quantum and classical photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: The x-ray vortex optical beam, distinguished by its topological charge and orbital angular momentum, offers new insights in probing complex electronic structures, enhancing material characterization, and advancing high-resolution imaging techniques. Here we propose a straightforward and effective method to generate intense x-ray vortices with tunable wavelengths in high-gain free-electron lasers (FELs). By simply adjusting the wavefront tilt of the radiation pulse during the FEL gain process, high-quality vortex beam can be amplified until saturation. Compared to existing methods for FEL vortex generation, the proposed technique imposes no wavelength limitations and can be easily implemented in high-gain FEL facilities, regardless of the operation modes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Broadband THz Generation from NV Centers in Bulk Diamond Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond single crystals are promising nonlinear THz sources due to their high damage threshold, transparency, and small dispersion linear dispersion over THz-NIR which enables relaxing the need for additional phase-matching engineering . However, the centrosymmetry of a diamond's lattice prohibits even-order nonlinear effects, including second harmonic generation and optical rectification. We demonstrate broadband THz emission via optical rectification in an NV-doped diamond, where NV centers break inversion symmetry and induce a nonlinear susceptibility in the lattice. THz time-domain spectroscopy reveals single-cycle emission spanning over 4 THz bandwidth, enabled by a high NV density (~200 ppm) and lattice strain. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms the emergence of finite second-order nonlinear susceptibility, directly linking symmetry breaking to THz generation. The wide bandgap and defect-induced strain support efficient THz emission without crystal damage, establishing NV-diamond as a robust platform for high-field ultrabroadband THz generation.</description>

      <title>HfO$_2$-based platform for high-index-contrast visible/UV integrated photonics</title>

Abstract: Ultraviolet and visible integrated photonics are enabling for applications in quantum information, sensing, and spectroscopy, among others. Few materials support low-loss photonics into the UV, and the relatively low refractive index of known depositable materials limits the achievable functionality. Here we present a high-index integrated photonics platform based on HfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ composites deposited via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) with low loss in the visible and near-UV. We show that Al$_2$O$_3$ incorporation dramatically decreases bulk loss compared to pure HfO$_2$, consistent with inhibited crystallization due to the admixture of Al$_2$O$_3$. Composites exhibit refractive index $n$ following the average of that of HfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$, weighted by the HfO$_2$ fractional composition $x$. At $\lambda=375$ nm, composites with $x=0.67$ exhibit $n=2.08$ preserving most of HfO$_2$'s significantly higher index, and $3.8(7) $ dB/cm material loss. We further present fully etched and cladded waveguides, grating couplers, and ring resonators, realizing single-mode waveguide loss of $0.25(2)$ dB/cm inferred from resonators of 2.6 million intrinsic quality factor at $\lambda=729$ nm, $2.6(2)$ dB/cm at $\lambda=405$ nm, and $7.7(6)$ dB/cm at $\lambda=375$ nm. We measure the composite's thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) to be $2.44(3) \times 10^{-5}$ RIU/$^\circ$C near $\lambda=397$ nm. This work establishes (HfO$_2$)$_x$(Al$_2$O$_3$)$_{1-x}$ composites as a platform amenable to integration for low-loss, high-index photonics spanning the UV to NIR.</description>

      <title>Sub-quadratic scalable approximate linear converter using multi-plane light conversion with low-entropy mode mixers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical computing is emerging as a promising platform for energy-efficient, high-throughput hardware in deep learning. A key challenge lies in the realization of optical matrix-vector multiplication, which often requires $O(N^2)$ phase shifters for exact synthesis of $N \times N$ matrices, limiting scalability. In this study, we propose an approximate matrix realization method using multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) that reduces both the system size and the number of phase shifters while maintaining acceptable error bounds. This approach uses low-entropy mode mixers, allowing more compact implementations compared to conventional mixers. We introduce Shannon matrix entropy as a measure of mode coupling strength in mixers and demonstrate that low-entropy mixers can preserve computational accuracy while reducing the requirements for the mixers. The approximation quality is evaluated using the maximum norm between the target and realized matrices. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves sub-quadratic scaling of phase shifters by tolerating predefined error thresholds. To identify efficient architectures for implementing general linear matrices, we compare block-encoding (BE) and singular-value decomposition (SVD) schemes for realizing general linear matrices using unitary converters based on MPLC. Results indicate that BE exhibits superior iterative configuration properties beyond the unitary group. By characterizing the trade-offs between matrix entropy, number of phase shifter layers, and the error tolerance, this study provides a framework for designing scalable and efficient approximate optical converters.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-scale Cavities for Mid-infrared Radiation via Image Phonon Polariton Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface-polaritons play a pivotal role in strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale due to their ability to confine light to deep subwavelength dimensions. A promising class of materials exhibiting such polaritonic response are polar dielectrics, which support surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs). While SPhPs offer significantly lower losses compared to other polaritons, their potential has been underutilized due to limited ability to reach large continent factors. Here, we demonstrate a system composed of silver nanocubes deposited on a SiC polar dielectric, which experimentally realizes the antisymmetric-image-phonon-polaritons (AIPhPs) mode: a hybridized SPhPs mode that can confine mid-infrared radiation to extremely small mode-volumes, almost a billion times smaller than their free-space volume, with quality-factors an order-of-magnitude greater than those of surface-plasmons or graphene-plasmons, surpassing values of 180. Our method is general, scalable, and applicable to any polar dielectric, opening the path for controlling and manipulating strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale in the long-wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Light Localization via Coherent Control: The Interplay of Transmission, Absorption and Disorder in Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between structural disorder, absorption, and Lyapunov exponent dynamics to exploit localization phenomena in photonic crystals with engineered defect layers. We generate disorder by introducing random refractive index variations in one of the bilayers, while the application of a control field to $\Lambda$-type atoms within a central defect layer enables dynamic tuning of the effective refractive index of crystal. We have employed traditional transfer matrix method to demonstrate transmission, Lyapunov exponents and absorption in the crystal. Through coherent control, we dynamically tune absorption, revealing sharp contrasts in band gap and band edge regions. while Lyapunov exponents, quantifying localization lengths, exhibit a consistent scaling across both band gap and band edge frequencies, and this behavior remains robust even in the presence of disorder. Hence, distinct localization mechanisms emerge at bandgap and band-edge frequencies. Bandgap localization arises from optical mode confinement and resonant alignment of atomic transitions with the probe field while band edge localization stems from a synergy of loss-difference-induced trapping and Anderson like disorder effects. Notably, while disorder weakens confinement localization in the band gap, it actually strengthens localization at the band edges. These results deepen the understanding of light-matter coupling in disordered photonic systems and provide a framework for designing reconfigurable optical devices with tailored localization properties.</description>

Abstract: We compare the enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in argon using 800--400 and 800--266~nm laser fields with their optimized single-color counterparts. We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the single-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon energy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme is optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG produced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other single- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm fields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short" electron trajectories.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupling in Helical Waveguides: A Local Duality Perspective and Emergent Gauge Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual symmetry is an intrinsic property of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to a global U(1) symmetry in vacuum, with helicity as the associated conserved quantity. In this paper, we investigate light propagation in a spin-degenerate medium using a field-theoretical approach and introduce an effective gauge field A_s that emerges from the localization of dual symmetry. Within the geometric optics approximation, we show that the helical trajectory of light rays reveals this gauge field as a manifestation of spin-orbit coupling. Although orbital-orbit coupling also arises in such systems, the spin-orbit interaction possesses deeper physical significance, as it originates from the intrinsic dual symmetry embedded in Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a hybrid light-matter unitary transformation for cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the spectral shift of an atom induced by quantum fluctuations in a chiral vacuum cavity. Remarkably, we find an intriguing angular momentum-dependent shift in the spectra of bound states. Our approach shows promise in going beyond traditional perturbative methods and demonstrates effectiveness even in the strong-coupling limit, as evidenced by our numerical benchmarks in the case of a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. In addition, we establish a cavity-interaction picture for calculating the chiral vacuum Rabi oscillation in the strong-coupling limit for a generic central potential. The anomalous spectral shift revealed in this study possesses both fundamental and practical significance and could be readily observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Evolution of a Dense Ensemble of Optically Pumped Excitons to a Charge Transfer State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses are mainstream in studies on the dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as in, e.g., organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground state ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt, for the phase transition, a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor that appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state that then evolves, while interacting with other degrees of freedom which are prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density, which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains that evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</description>

      <title>Non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction of an rf/microwave signal to the optical domain, and vice versa, paves the way for technologies that exploit the advantages of each domain to perform quantum operations. Since electro-optomechanical devices implement a simultaneous coupling of a mechanical oscillator to both an rf/microwave field and an optical field, they are suitable for the realization of a quantum transducer. The membrane-in-the-middle setup is a possible solution, once its vibrational mode is cooled down to ultra cryogenic temperature for achieving quantum operation. This work is focused on the mechanical characterization via an optical interferometric probe, down to T=18mK, of a loss-shielded metalized membrane designed for this purpose. A stroboscopic technique has been exploited for revealing a mechanical quality factor up to 64 millions at the lowest temperature. In fact, with continuous illumination and a cryostat temperature below 1K, the heat due to optical absorption is not efficiently dissipated anymore, and the membrane remains hotter than its environment.</description>
