      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed or evolved towards the current strains of a virus. In learning terms, this corresponds to a myopic best response, i.e., not considering the possible adaptive moves of the opponent. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. To motivate our work, we consider antibody designs that target not only the current viral strains but also the wide range of possible future variants that the virus might evolve into under the evolutionary pressure exerted by said antibodies. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of the viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simple model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.</description>

      <title>Foundations of ecological and evolutionary change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological evolution is realised through the same mechanisms of birth and death that underlie change in population density. The deep interdependence between ecology and evolution is well-established, but much theory in each discipline has been developed in isolation. While recent work has accomplished eco-evolutionary synthesis, a gap remains between the logical foundations of ecology and evolution. We bridge this gap with a new equation that defines a summed value for a characteristic across individuals in a population, from which the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolutionary biology (the Price equation) are derived. We thereby unify the fundamental equations of population ecology and biological evolution under a general framework. Our unification further demonstrates the equivalence between mean population growth rate and evolutionary fitness, shows how ecological and evolutionary change are reflected in the first and second statistical moments of fitness, respectively, and links this change to ecosystem function.</description>

      <title>Higher-order interactions in random Lotka-Volterra communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use generating functionals to derive a dynamic mean-field description for generalised Lotka-Volterra systems with higher-order quenched random interactions. We use the resulting single effective species process to determine the stability diagram in the space of parameters specifying the statistics of interactions, and to calculate the properties of the surviving community in the stable phase. We find that the behaviour as a function of the model parameters is often similar to the pairwise model. For example, the presence of more exploitative interactions increases stability. However we also find differences. For instance, we confirm in more general settings an observation made previously in model with third-order interactions that more competition between species can increase linear stability, and the diversity in the community, an effect not seen in the pairwise model. The phase diagram of the model with higher-order interactions is more complex than that of the model with pairwise interactions. We identify a new mathematical condition for a sudden onset of diverging abundances.</description>

      <title>Substantial extension of the lifetime of the terrestrial biosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximately one billion years (Gyr) in the future, as the Sun brightens, Earth's carbonate-silicate cycle is expected to drive CO$_2$ below the minimum level required by vascular land plants, eliminating most macroscopic land life. Here, we couple global-mean models of temperature- and CO$_2$-dependent plant productivity for C$_3$ and C$_4$ plants, silicate weathering, and climate to re-examine the time remaining for terrestrial plants. If weathering is weakly temperature-dependent (as recent data suggest) and/or strongly CO$_2$-dependent, we find that the interplay between climate, productivity, and weathering causes the future luminosity-driven CO$_2$ decrease to slow and temporarily reverse, averting plant CO$_2$ starvation. This dramatically lengthens plant survival from 1 Gyr up to $\sim$1.6-1.86 Gyr, until extreme temperatures halt photosynthesis, suggesting a revised kill mechanism for land plants and potential doubling of the future lifespan of Earth's land macrobiota. An increased future lifespan for the complex biosphere may imply that Earth life had to achieve a smaller number of ``hard steps'' (unlikely evolutionary transitions) to produce intelligent life than previously estimated. These results also suggest that complex photosynthetic land life on Earth and exoplanets may be able to persist until the onset of the moist greenhouse transition.</description>

      <title>Equidistant Circular Split Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are generalizations of trees that allow for the modeling of non-tree like evolutionary processes. Split networks give a useful way to construct networks with intuitive distance structures induced from the associated split graph. We explore the polyhedral geometry of distance matrices built from circular split systems which have the added property of being equidistant. We give a characterization of the facet defining inequalities and the extreme rays of the cone of distances that arises from an equidistant network associated to any circular split network. We also explain a connection to the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope from geometric combinatorics.</description>
