      <title>Exact solution for a discrete-time SIR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonstandard finite difference scheme for the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) continuous model. We prove that our discretized system is dynamically consistent with its continuous counterpart and we derive its exact solution. We end with the analysis of the long-term behavior of susceptible, infected and removed individuals, illustrating our results with examples. In contrast with the SIR discrete-time model available in the literature, our new model is simultaneously mathematically and biologically sound.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial Kron Reduction for Power Grid Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kron reduction is used in power grid modeling when the analysis can -- supposedly -- be restricted to a subset of nodes. Typically, when one is interested in the phases' dynamics, it is common to reduce the load buses and focus on the generators' behavior. The rationale behind this reduction is that voltage phases at load buses adapt quickly to their neighbors' phases and, at the timescale of generators, they have virtually no dynamics. We show that the dynamics of the Kron-reduced part of a network can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the non-reduced buses. Therefore, Kron reduction should be used with care and, depending on the context, reduced nodes cannot be simply ignored. We demonstrate that the noise in the reduced part can unexpectedly affect the non-reduced part, even under the assumption that nodal disturbances are independent. Therefore, the common assumption that the noise in the non-reduced part is uncorrelated may lead to inaccurate assessments of the grid's behavior. To cope with such shortcomings of the Kron reduction, we show how to properly incorporate the contribution of the reduced buses into the reduced model using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fully describe all horocycle orbit closures in $ \mathbb{Z} $-covers of compact hyperbolic surfaces. Our results rely on a careful analysis of the efficiency of all distance minimizing geodesic rays in the cover. As a corollary we obtain in this setting that all non-maximal horocycle orbit closures, while fractal, have integer Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Horizontally stationary generalized Bratteli diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bratteli diagrams with countably infinite levels exhibit a new phenomenon: they can be horizontally stationary. The incidence matrices of these horizontally stationary Bratteli diagrams are infinite banded Toeplitz matrices. In this paper, we study the fundamental properties of horizontally stationary Bratteli diagrams. In these diagrams, we provide an explicit description of ergodic tail invariant probability measures. For a certain class of horizontally stationary Bratteli diagrams, we prove that all ergodic tail invariant probability measures are extensions of measures from odometers. Additionally, we establish conditions for the existence of a continuous Vershik map on the path space of a horizontally stationary Bratteli diagram.</description>

      <title>Participation Factors for Nonlinear Autonomous Dynamical Systems in the Koopman Operator Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise a novel formulation and propose the concept of modal participation factors to nonlinear dynamical systems. The original definition of modal participation factors (or simply participation factors) provides a simple yet effective metric. It finds use in theory and practice, quantifying the interplay between states and modes of oscillation in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. In this paper, with the Koopman operator framework, we present the results of participation factors for nonlinear dynamical systems with an asymptotically stable equilibrium point or limit cycle. We show that participation factors are defined for the entire domain of attraction, beyond the vicinity of an attractor, where the original definition of participation factors for LTI systems is a special case. Finally, we develop a numerical method to estimate participation factors using time series data from the underlying nonlinear dynamical system. The numerical method can be implemented by leveraging a well-established numerical scheme in the Koopman operator framework called dynamic mode decomposition.</description>

      <title>A cytokine-enhanced viral infection model with CTL immune response, distributed delay and saturation incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a delayed cytokine-enhanced viral infection model incorporating saturation incidence and immune response. We compute the basic reproduction numbers and introduce a convex cone to discuss the impact of non-negative initial data on solutions. By defining appropriate Lyapunov functionals and employing LaSalle's invariance principle, we investigate the stability of three equilibria: the disease-free equilibrium, the immunity-inactivated equilibrium, and the immunity-activated equilibrium. We establish conditions under which these equilibria are globally asymptotically stable. Numerical analyses not only corroborate the theoretical results but also reveal that intervention in virus infection can be achieved by extending the delay period.</description>

      <title>Pressure path metrics on parabolic families of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a subfamily of the moduli space of degree $D\ge2$ polynomials defined by a finite number of parabolic relations. Let $\Omega$ be a bounded stable component of $\Lambda$ with the property that all critical points are attracted by either the persistent parabolic cycles or by attracting cycles in $\mathbb C$. We construct a positive semi-definite pressure form on $\Omega$ and show that it defines a path metric on $\Omega$. This provides a counterpart in complex dynamics of the pressure metric on cusped Hitchin components recently studied by Kao and Bray-Canary-Kao-Martone.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of bilinear polynomial averages over the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that on a $\sigma$-finite measure preserving system $X = (X,\nu, T)$, the non-conventional ergodic averages $$ \mathbb{E}_{n \in [N]} \Lambda(n) f(T^n x) g(T^{P(n)} x)$$ converge pointwise almost everywhere for $f \in L^{p_1}(X)$, $g \in L^{p_2}(X)$, and $1/p_1 + 1/p_2 \leq 1$, where $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree at least $2$. This had previously been established with the von Mangoldt weight $\Lambda$ replaced by the constant weight $1$ by the first and third authors with Mirek, and by the M\"obius weight $\mu$ by the fourth author. The proof is based on combining tools from both of these papers, together with several Gowers norm and polynomial averaging operator estimates on approximants to the von Mangoldt function of ''Cram\'er'' and ''Heath-Brown'' type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general and natural framework to study the dynamics of composition operators on spaces of measurable functions, in which we then reconsider the characterizations for hypercyclic and mixing composition operators obtained by Bayart, Darji and Pires. We show that the notions of hypercyclicity and weak mixing coincide in this context and, if the system is dissipative, the recurrent composition operators agree with the hypercyclic ones. We also give a characterization for invertible composition operators satisfying Kitai's Criterion, and we construct an example of a mixing composition operator not satisfying Kitai's Criterion. For invertible dissipative systems with bounded distortion we show that composition operators satisfying Kitai's Criterion coincide with the mixing operators.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamics of the extension graph of graph product of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the extension graph of graph product of groups and study its geometry. This enables us to study properties of graph products of groups by exploiting large scale geometry of its defining graph. In particular, we show that the extension graph exhibits the same phenomenon about asymptotic dimension as quasi-trees of metric spaces studied by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara. Moreover, we present three applications of the extension graph of graph product when a defining graph is hyperbolic. First, we provide a new class of convergence groups by considering the action of graph product of finite groups on a compactification of the extension graph and identify the if and only if condition for this action to be geometrically finite. Secondly, we prove relative hyperbolicity of the semi-direct product of groups that interpolates between wreath product and free product. Finally, we provide a new class of graph product of finite groups whose group von Neumnann algebra is strongly solid.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Ensemble Kalman Filter in the Near-Linear Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution captures the statistics of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. Classical particle filters provably approximate this distribution in quite general settings; however they behave poorly for high dimensional problems, suffering weight collapse. This issue is circumvented by the ensemble Kalman filter which is an equal-weight interacting particle system. However, this finite particle system is only proven to approximate the true filter in the linear Gaussian case. In practice, however, it is applied in much broader settings; as a result, establishing its approximation properties more generally is important. There has been recent progress in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm, establishing stability and error estimates in non-Gaussian settings, but the assumptions on the dynamics and observation models rule out the unbounded vector fields that arise in practice and the analysis applies only to the mean field limit of the ensemble Kalman filter. The present work establishes error bounds between the filtering distribution and the finite particle ensemble Kalman filter when the model exhibits linear growth.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a new scheme for studying the dynamics of a quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping in a 3D smooth bounded domain. As an application, the existence and structure of weak, strong, and exponential attractors for the solution semigroup of this equation are obtained. The investigation sheds light on the well-posedness and long-time behavior of nonlinear dissipative evolution equations with nonlinear damping and critical nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Data-free Non-intrusive Model Reduction for Nonlinear Finite Element Models via Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing rigorous, low-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs) of high-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems. A direct computation of SSMs requires explicit knowledge of nonlinear coefficients in the equations of motion, which limits their applicability to generic finite-element (FE) solvers. Here, we propose a non-intrusive algorithm for the computation of the SSMs and the associated ROMs up to arbitrary polynomial orders. This non-intrusive algorithm only requires system nonlinearity as a black box and hence, enables SSM-based model reduction via generic finite-element software. Our expressions and algorithms are valid for systems with up to cubic-order nonlinearities, including velocity-dependent nonlinear terms, asymmetric damping, and stiffness matrices, and hence work for a large class of mechanics problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-intrusive approach over a variety of FE examples of increasing complexity, including a micro-resonator FE model containing more than a million degrees of freedom.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales, whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work, we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged Euler-Poincare (LAEP) theory.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for the Kontsevich-Zorich Cocycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a central limit theorem holds for exterior powers of the Kontsevich-Zorich (KZ) cocycle. In particular, we show that, under the hypothesis that the top Lyapunov exponent on the exterior power is simple, a central limit theorem holds for the lift of the (leafwise) hyperbolic Brownian motion to any strongly irreducible, symplectic, $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-invariant subbundle, that is moreover symplectic-orthogonal to the so-called tautological subbundle. We then show that this implies that a central limit theorem holds for the lift of the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow to the same bundle.
  For the random cocycle over the hyperbolic Brownian motion, we prove under the same hypotheses that the variance of the top exponent is strictly positive. For the deterministic cocycle over the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow we prove that the variance is strictly positive only for the top exponent of the first exterior power (the KZ cocycle itself) under the hypothesis that its Lyapunov spectrum is simple.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds For Some Asymptotic Formulas for Counting Words in Shift Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13898v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a version of the counting problem in dynamical systems that is of interest, especially in conformal dynamical systems where the functions of the systems are angle preserving. Recently, M. Pollicott and M. Urba\'{n}ski published a result in this context for D-generic systems where the complex transfer operator behaves nicely on the critical line of the Poincar\'{e} series. Their result contains an asymptotic formula for the Apollonian circle packing. We lift the D-generic condition and conformality of the functions system in this paper to see how their asymptotic formula changes. We use some recent Tauberian theorem to show that the formula gets a form whose limit infimum and limit supremum bounds can be obtained in the sharpest sense. Further, we observed an asymptotic of length closely related to this counting problem. In fact, not only the number of words is subject to some formula, but also their length as well.</description>

      <title>Semi-conjugacy rigidity for endomorphisms derived from Anosov on the 2-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a non-invertible partially hyperbolic endomorphism on $\mathbb{T}^2$ which is derived from a non-expanding Anosov endomorphism. Differing from the case of diffeomorphisms derived from Anosov automorphisms, there is no a priori semi-conjugacy between $f$ and its linearization on $\mathbb{T}^2$. We show that $f$ is semi-conjugate to its linearization if and only if $f$ admits the partially hyperbolic splitting with two $Df$-invariant subbundles.
  Moreover, if we assume that $f$ has the unstable subbundle, then the semi-conjugacy is exactly a topological conjugacy, and the center Lyapunov exponents of periodic points of $f$ coincide and equal to the stable Lyapunov exponent of its linearization. In particular, $f$ is an Anosov endomorphism and the conjugacy is smooth along the stable foliation.
  For the case that $f$ has the stable subbundle, there is still some rigidity on its stable Lyapunov exponents. However, we also give examples which admit the partially hyperbolic splitting with the center subbundle but the semi-conjugacy is indeed non-injective.
  Finally, We present some applications for the conservative case. In particular, we show that if $f$ is volume-preserving and semi-conjugate to its linear part, then the semi-conjugacy is actually a smooth conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Investigating Ocean Circulation Dynamics Through Data Assimilation: A Mathematical Study Using the Stommel Box Model with Rapid Oscillatory Forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate ocean circulation changes through the lens of data assimilation using a reduced-order model. Our primary interest lies in the Stommel box model which reveals itself to be one of the most practicable models that has the ability of reproducing the meridional overturning circulation. The Stommel box model has at most two regimes: TH (temperature driven circulation with sinking near the north pole) and SA (salinity driven with sinking near the equator). Currently, the meridional overturning is in the TH regime. Using box-averaged Met Office EN4 ocean temperature and salinity data, our goal is to provide a probability that a future regime change occurs and establish how this probability depends on the uncertainties in initial conditions, parameters and forcings. We will achieve this using data assimilation tools and DAPPER within the Stommel box model with fast oscillatory regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a theory for multivariate extreme value analysis of dynamical systems. Namely, we provide conditions adapted to the dynamical setting which enable the study of dependence between extreme values of the components of $\R^d$-valued observables evaluated along the orbits of the systems. We study this cross-sectional dependence, which results from the combination of a spatial and a temporal dependence structures. We give several illustrative applications, where concrete systems and dependence sources are introduced and analysed.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the least-deletion map on the Cantor space, namely the map that changes the first 1 in a binary sequence to 0, and construct product measures on $2^\mathbb{N}$ so that the corresponding Radon-Nikodym cocycles oscillate or converge to zero nonsummably along the forward geodesic of the map. These examples answer two questions of Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob. We analyze the oscillating example in terms of random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, using the Chung-Fuchs theorem.</description>

      <title>Cartan subalgebras of C*-algebras associated with complex dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a rational function with degree $\geq 2$ and $X$ be its Julia set, its Fatou set, or the Riemann sphere. Suppose that $X$ is not empty. We can regard $R$ as a continuous map from $X$ onto itself. Kajiwara and Watatani showed that in the case that $X$ is the Julia set, $C_0(X)$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$, where $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$ denotes the C*-algebra associated with the dynamical system $(X,R)$ introduced by them. In this paper, we develop their result and give the equivalent condition for $C_0(X)$ to be a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$.</description>

      <title>Vector bundle automorphisms preserving Morse-Bott foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\mathcal{F}$ a Morse-Bott foliation on $M$ with a compact critical manifold $\Sigma$. Denote by $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ leaving invariant each leaf of $\mathcal{F}$. Under certain assumptions on $\mathcal{F}$ it is shown that the computation of the homotopy type of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ reduces to three rather independent groups: the group of diffeomorphisms of $\Sigma$, the group of vector bundle automorphisms of some regular neighborhood of $\Sigma$, and the subgroup of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ consisting of diffeomorphisms fixed near $\Sigma$. Examples of computations of homotopy types of groups $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ for such foliations are also presented.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Partitioned Distributed Observer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper develops a greedy-idea-based large-scale system partition algorithm, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the partitioned distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between partitions. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proven, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the partitioned distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the partitioned distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show that when the similarity between the physical network and the communication network is about 80%, the local observer dimension is greatly reduced by 90% and the relative error between the performance of the distributed control law and that of the centralized control law is less than 1%.</description>

      <title>Incentive Designs for Learning Agents to Stabilize Coupled Exogenous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a large population of learning agents noncooperatively selecting strategies from a common set, influencing the dynamics of an exogenous system (ES) we seek to stabilize at a desired equilibrium. Our approach is to design a dynamic payoff mechanism capable of shaping the population's strategy profile, thus affecting the ES's state, by offering incentives for specific strategies within budget limits. Employing system-theoretic passivity concepts, we establish conditions under which a payoff mechanism can be systematically constructed to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the ES's equilibrium. In comparison to previous approaches originally studied in the context of the so-called epidemic population games, the method proposed here allows for more realistic epidemic models and other types of ESs, such as predator-prey dynamics. The stability of the equilibrium is established with the support of a Lyapunov function, which provides useful bounds on the transient states.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

Abstract: We study the property of uniform discreteness within discrete orbits of non-uniform lattices in $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, acting on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by linear transformations. We provide quantitative consequences of previous results by using Diophantine properties. We give a partial result toward a conjecture of Leli\`evre regarding the set of long cylinder holonomy vectors of the "golden L" translation surface: for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, three points of this set can be found on a horizontal line within a distance of $\epsilon$ of each other.</description>
