      <title>A Monotone Circuit Construction for Individually-Secure Multi-Secret Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new technique for taking a single-secret sharing scheme with a general access structure and transforming it into an individually secure multi-secret sharing scheme where every secret has the same general access structure. To increase the information rate, we consider Individual Security which guarantees zero mutual information with each secret individually, for any unauthorized subsets. Our approach involves identifying which shares of the single-secret sharing scheme can be replaced by linear combinations of messages. When $m-1$ shares are replaced, our scheme obtains an information rate of $m/|S|$, where $S$ is the set of shares. This provides an improvement over the information rate of $1/|S|$ in the original single-secret sharing scheme.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerant Codebooks for Semi-Quantitative Group Testing: Application to Spatial Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in spatial genomics, we revisit group testing (Dorfman~1943) and propose the class of $\lambda$-{\sf ADD}-codes, studying such codes with certain distance $d$ and codelength $n$. When $d$ is constant, we provide explicit code constructions with rates close to $1/2$. When $d$ is proportional to $n$, we provide a GV-type lower bound whose rates are efficiently computable. Upper bounds for such codes are also studied.</description>

      <title>Syndrome-based Fusion Rules in Heterogeneous Distributed Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the heterogeneous distributed quickest change detection (HetDQCD) with 1-bit non-anonymous feedback is studied. The concept of syndromes is introduced and the family of syndrome-based fusion rules is proposed, which encompasses all deterministic fusion rules as special cases. Through the Hasse diagram of syndromes, upper and lower bounds on the second-order performance of expected detection delay as a function of average run length to false alarm are provided. An interesting instance, the weighted voting rule previously proposed in our prior work, is then revisited, for which an efficient pruning method for breadth-first search in the Hasse diagram is proposed to analyze the performance. This in turn assists in the design of the weight threshold in the weighted voting rule. Simulation results corroborate that our analysis is instrumental in identifying a proper design for the weighted voting rule, demonstrating consistent superiority over both the anonymous voting rule and the group selection rule in HetDQCD.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Radar Spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic countermeasure (ECM) technology plays a critical role in modern electronic warfare, which can interfere with enemy radar detection systems by noise or deceptive signals. However, the conventional active jamming strategy incurs additional hardware and power costs and has the potential threat of exposing the target itself. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided radar spoofing strategy in this letter, where IRS is deployed on the surface of a target to help eliminate the signals reflected towards the hostile radar to shield the target, while simultaneously redirecting its reflected signal towards a surrounding clutter to generate deceptive angle-of-arrival (AoA) sensing information for the radar. We optimize the IRS's reflection to maximize the received signal power at the radar from the direction of the selected clutter subject to the constraint that its received power from the direction of the target is lower than a given detection threshold. We first solve this non-convex optimization problem using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and further propose a lower-complexity solution for real-time implementation. Simulation results validate the efficacy of our proposed IRS-aided spoofing system as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Configuration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces With Non-uniform Phase Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing methods for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) beamforming in wireless communication are typically limited to uniform phase quantization. However, in real world applications, the phase and bit resolution of RIS units are often non-uniform due to practical requirements and engineering challenges. To fill this research gap, we formulate an optimization problem for discrete non-uniform phase configuration in RIS assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communications. Subsequently, a partition-and-traversal (PAT) algorithm is proposed to solve that, achieving the global optimal solution. The efficacy and superiority of the PAT algorithm are validated through numerical simulations, and the impact of non-uniform phase quantization on system performance is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity OTFS-Based Over-the-Air Computation Design for Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates over-the-air computation (AirComp) over multiple-access time-varying channels, where devices with high mobility transmit their sensing data to a fusion center (FC) for averaging. To combat the Doppler shift induced by time-varying channels, each device adopts orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Our objective is minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) for the target function estimation. Due to the multipath time-varying channels, the OTFS-based AirComp not only suffers from noise but also interference. Specifically, we propose three schemes, namely S1, S2, and S3, for the target function estimation. S1 directly estimates the target function under the impacts of noise and interference. S2 mitigates the interference by introducing a zero padding-assisted OTFS. In S3, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate the function in a matrix form. In the numerical results, we evaluate the performance of S1, S2, and S3 from the perspectives of MSE and computational complexity, and compare them with benchmarks. Specifically, compared to benchmarks, S3 outperforms them with a significantly lower MSE but incurs a higher computational complexity. In contrast, S2 demonstrates a reduction in both MSE and computational complexity. Lastly, S1 shows superior error performance at small SNR and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Group Complete-$\{s\}$ Pliable Index Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of PICOD($t$) problems referred to as $g$-group complete-$S$ PICOD($t$) problems. It constructs a multi-stage achievability scheme to generate pliable index codes for group complete PICOD problems when $S = \{s\}$ is a singleton set. Using the maximum acyclic induced subgraph bound, lower bounds on the broadcast rate are derived for singleton $S$, which establishes the optimality of the achievability scheme for a range of values for $t$ and for any $g$ and $s$. For all other values, it is shown that the achievability scheme is optimal among the restricted class of broadcast codes.</description>

      <title>Capacity Maximization for Base Station with Hybrid Fixed and Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an effective solution for enhancing wireless network capacity through the adjustment of both 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces. Although freely positioning/rotating 6DMA surfaces offers the greatest flexibility and thus highest capacity improvement, its implementation may be challenging in practice due to the drastic architecture change required for existing base stations (BSs), which predominantly adopt fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays (e.g., sector antenna arrays). Thus, we introduce in this letter a new BS architecture called hybrid fixed and movable antennas (HFMA), which consists of both conventional FPA arrays and position/rotation-adjustable 6DMA surfaces. For ease of implementation, we consider that all 6DMA surfaces can rotate along a circular track above the FPA arrays. We aim to maximize the network capacity via optimizing the rotation angles of all 6DMA surfaces based on the users' spatial distribution. Since this problem is combinatorial and its optimal solution requires prohibitively high computational complexity via exhaustive search, we propose an alternative adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo based method to solve it more efficiently. Finally, we present simulation results that show significant performance gains achieved by our proposed design over various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Repairing Reed-Solomon Codes with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the problem of recovering a lost/erased symbol in a Reed-Solomon code to the scenario in which some side information about the lost symbol is known. The side information is represented as a set $S$ of linearly independent combinations of the sub-symbols of the lost symbol. When $S = \varnothing$, this reduces to the standard problem of repairing a single codeword symbol. When $S$ is a set of sub-symbols of the erased one, this becomes the repair problem with partially lost/erased symbol. We first establish that the minimum repair bandwidth depends on $|S|$ and not the content of $S$ and construct a lower bound on the repair bandwidth of a linear repair scheme with side information $S$. We then consider the well-known subspace-polynomial repair schemes and show that their repair bandwidths can be optimized by choosing the right subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate several parameter regimes where the optimal bandwidths can be achieved for full-length Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <title>Information Rates Over Multi-View Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of reliable communication over multi-view channels, in which the channel output is comprised of a large number of independent noisy views of a transmitted symbol. We consider first the setting of multi-view discrete memoryless channels and then extend our results to general multi-view channels (using multi-letter formulas). We argue that the channel capacity and dispersion of such multi-view channels converge exponentially fast in the number of views to the entropy and varentropy of the input distribution, respectively. We identify the exact rate of convergence as the smallest Chernoff information between two conditional distributions of the output, conditioned on unequal inputs. For the special case of the deletion channel, we compute upper bounds on this Chernoff information. Finally, we present a new channel model we term the Poisson approximation channel -- of possible independent interest -- whose capacity closely approximates the capacity of the multi-view binary symmetric channel for any fixed number of views.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Preserving Integrated Sensing and Communication with Secure Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution-preserving integrated sensing and communication with secure reconstruction is investigated in this paper. In addition to the distortion constraint, we impose another constraint on the distance between the reconstructed sequence distribution and the original state distribution to force the system to preserve the statistical property of the channel states. An inner bound of the distribution-preserving capacity-distortion region is provided with some capacity region results under special cases. A numerical example demonstrates the tradeoff between the communication rate, reconstruction distortion and distribution preservation. Furthermore, we consider the case that the reconstructed sequence should be kept secret from an eavesdropper who also observes the channel output. An inner bound of the tradeoff region and a capacity-achieving special case are presented.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming with Gradient-based Liquid Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication with the advanced beamforming technologies is a key enabler to meet the growing demands of future mobile communication. However, the dynamic nature of cellular channels in large-scale urban mmWave MIMO communication scenarios brings substantial challenges, particularly in terms of complexity and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a robust gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) framework that utilizes ordinary differential equation-based liquid neurons to solve the beamforming problem. Specifically, our proposed GLNN framework takes gradients of the optimization objective function as inputs to extract the high-order channel feature information, and then introduces a residual connection to mitigate the training burden. Furthermore, we use the manifold learning technique to compress the search space of the beamforming problem. These designs enable the GLNN to effectively maintain low complexity while ensuring strong robustness to noisy and highly dynamic channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the GLNN can achieve 4.15% higher spectral efficiency than that of typical iterative algorithms, and reduce the time consumption to only 1.61% that of conventional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of computing $\alpha$-capacity for $\alpha&gt;1$ is equivalent to that of computing the correct decoding exponent. Various algorithms for computing them have been proposed, such as Arimoto and Jitsumatsu--Oohama algorithm. In this study, we propose a novel alternating optimization algorithm for computing the $\alpha$-capacity for $\alpha&gt;1$ based on a variational characterization of the Augustin--Csisz{\'a}r mutual information. A comparison of the convergence performance of these algorithms is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Networked Control with Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study feedback control of a dynamical process over a lossy channel equipped with a hybrid automatic repeat request protocol that connects a sensor to an actuator. The dynamical process is modeled by a Gauss-Markov process, and the lossy channel by a packet-erasure channel with ideal feedback. We suppose that data is communicated in the format of packets with negligible quantization error. In such a networked control system, whenever a packet loss occurs, there exists a tradeoff between transmitting new sensory information with a lower success probability and retransmitting previously failed sensory information with a higher success probability. In essence, an inherent tradeoff between freshness and reliability. To address this tradeoff, we consider a linear-quadratic-regulator performance index, which penalizes state deviations and control efforts over a finite horizon, and jointly design optimal policies for an encoder and a decoder, which are collocated with the sensor and the actuator, respectively. Our emphasis here lies specifically on designing switching and control policies, rather than error-correcting codes. We derive the structural properties of the optimal encoding and decoding policies. We show that the former is a threshold switching policy and the latter is a certainty-equivalent control policy. In addition, we specify the iterative equations that the encoder and the decoder need to solve in order to implement the optimal policies.</description>

      <title>On Securing Analog Lagrange Coded Computing from Colluding Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Lagrange Coded Computing (ALCC) is a recently proposed coded computing paradigm wherein certain computations over analog datasets can be efficiently performed using distributed worker nodes through floating point implementation. While ALCC is known to preserve privacy of data from the workers, it is not resilient to adversarial workers that return erroneous computation results. Pointing at this security vulnerability, we focus on securing ALCC from a wide range of non-colluding and colluding adversarial workers. As a foundational step, we make use of error-correction algorithms for Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codes to build novel algorithms to nullify the erroneous computations returned from the adversaries. Furthermore, when such a robust ALCC is implemented in practical settings, we show that the presence of precision errors in the system can be exploited by the adversaries to propose novel colluding attacks to degrade the computation accuracy. As the main takeaway, we prove a counter-intuitive result that not all the adversaries should inject noise in their computations in order to optimally degrade the accuracy of the ALCC framework. This is the first work of its kind to address the vulnerability of ALCC against colluding adversaries.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Compression Method for Sign Information of DCT Coefficients via Sign Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compression of the sign information of discrete cosine transform coefficients is an intractable problem in image compression schemes due to the equiprobable occurrence of the sign bits. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an efficient compression method for such sign information based on phase retrieval, which is a classical signal restoration problem attempting to find the phase information of discrete Fourier transform coefficients from their magnitudes. In our compression strategy, the sign bits of all the AC components in the cosine domain are excluded from a bitstream at the encoder and are complemented at the decoder by solving a sign recovery problem, which we call \textit{sign retrieval}. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous techniques for sign compression in terms of a rate-distortion criterion. Our method implemented in Python language is available from \url{https://github.com/ctsutake/sr}.</description>

      <title>Variable-Length Secret Key Agreement via Random Stopping Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a key agreement setting where two parties observe correlated random sources, and want to agree on a secret key via public discussions. In order to allow the key length to adapt to the realizations of the random sources, we allow the key to be of variable length, subject to a novel variable-length version of the uniformity constraint based on random stopping time. We propose simple, computationally efficient key agreement schemes under the new constraint. The proposed scheme can be considered as the key agreement analogue of variable-length source coding via Huffman coding, and the Knuth-Yao random number generator.</description>

      <title>Channel Coding Toward 6G: Technical Overview and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel coding plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliable communication over wireless channels. With the growing need for ultra-reliable communication in emerging wireless use cases, the significance of channel coding has amplified. Furthermore, minimizing decoding latency is crucial for critical-mission applications, while optimizing energy efficiency is paramount for mobile and the Internet of Things (IoT) communications. As the fifth generation (5G) of mobile communications is currently in operation and 5G-advanced is on the horizon, the objective of this paper is to assess prominent channel coding schemes in the context of recent advancements and the anticipated requirements for the sixth generation (6G). In this paper, after considering the potential impact of channel coding on key performance indicators (KPIs) of wireless networks, we review the evolution of mobile communication standards and the organizations involved in the standardization, from the first generation (1G) to the current 5G, highlighting the technologies integral to achieving targeted KPIs such as reliability, data rate, latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, connection density, and traffic capacity. Following this, we delve into the anticipated requirements for potential use cases in 6G. The subsequent sections of the paper focus on a comprehensive review of three primary coding schemes utilized in past generations and their recent advancements: low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, turbo codes (including convolutional codes), polar codes (alongside Reed-Muller codes). Additionally, we examine alternative coding schemes like Fountain codes and sparse regression codes. Our evaluation includes a comparative analysis of error correction performance and the performance of hardware implementation for these coding schemes, providing insights into their potential and suitability for the upcoming 6G era.</description>

      <title>On the Coexistence of eMBB and URLLC in the Cell-Free Massive MIMO Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-orthogonal coexistence between the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) in the downlink of a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We provide a unified information-theoretic framework that combines a finite-blocklength analysis of the URLLC error probability based on the use of mismatched decoding with an infinite-blocklength analysis of the eMBB spectral efficiency. Superposition coding and three levels of puncturing are considered as alternative downlink coexistence strategies to cope with the inter-service interference and the URLLC random activation pattern, under the assumption of imperfect pilot-based channel state information acquisition at the access points and statistical channel knowledge at the users. Numerical results shed light into the trade-off between eMBB and URLLC performances considering different precoding and power control strategies.</description>

      <title>Local Mutual-Information Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local mutual-information differential privacy (LMIDP) is a privacy notion that aims to quantify the reduction of uncertainty about the input data when the output of a privacy-preserving mechanism is revealed. We study the relation of LMIDP with local differential privacy (LDP), the de facto standard notion of privacy in context-independent (CI) scenarios, and with local information privacy (LIP), the state-of-the-art notion for context-dependent settings. We establish explicit conversion rules, i.e., bounds on the privacy parameters for a LMIDP mechanism to also satisfy LDP/LIP, and vice versa. We use our bounds to formally verify that LMIDP is a weak privacy notion. We also show that uncorrelated Gaussian noise is the best-case noise in terms of CI-LMIDP if both the input data and the noise are subject to an average power constraint.</description>

      <title>Partial information decomposition as information bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial information decomposition (PID) aims to quantify the amount of redundant information that a set of sources provide about a target. Here we show that this goal can be formulated as a type of information bottleneck (IB) problem, which we term the "redundancy bottleneck" (RB). The RB formalizes a tradeoff between prediction and compression: it extracts information from the sources that predicts the target, without revealing which source provided the information. It can be understood as a generalization "Blackwell redundancy", which we previously proposed as a principled measure of PID redundancy. The "RB curve" quantifies the prediction/compression tradeoff at multiple scales. This curve can also be quantified for individual sources, allowing subsets of redundant sources to be identified without combinatorial optimization. We provide an efficient iterative algorithm for computing the RB curve.</description>

      <title>New Solutions to Delsarte's Dual Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the maximum size of a code with a given minimum distance is a major question in computer science and discrete mathematics. The most fruitful approach for finding asymptotic bounds on such codes is by using Delsarte's theory of association schemes. With this approach, Delsarte constructs a linear program such that its maximum value is an upper bound on the maximum size of a code with a given minimum distance. Bounding this value can be done by finding solutions to the corresponding dual linear program. Delsarte's theory is very general and goes way beyond binary codes.
  In this work, we provide universal bounds in the framework of association schemes that generalize the Hamming bound and the Elias-Bassalygo bound, which can be applied to any association scheme constructed from a distance function. These bounds are obtained by constructing new solutions to Delsarte's dual linear program. We instantiate these results and we recover known bounds for $q$-ary codes and for constant-weight binary codes but which didn't come from the linear program method. Our other contribution is to recover, for essentially any $Q$-polynomial scheme, MRRW-type solutions to Delsarte's dual linear program which are inspired by the Laplacian approach of Friedman and Tillich instead of using the Christoffel-Darboux formulas. We show in particular how the second linear programming bound can be interpreted in this framework.</description>

      <title>Practical Short-Length Coding Schemes for Binary Distributed Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates practical coding schemes for Distributed Hypothesis Testing (DHT). While the literature has extensively analyzed the information-theoretic performance of DHT and established bounds on Type-II error exponents through quantize and quantize-binning achievability schemes, the practical implementation of DHT coding schemes has not yet been investigated. Therefore, this paper introduces practical implementations of quantizers and quantize-binning schemes for DHT, leveraging short-length binary linear block codes. Furthermore, it provides exact analytical expressions for Type-I and Type-II error probabilities associated with each proposed coding scheme. Numerical results show the accuracy of the proposed analytical error probability expressions, and enable to compare the performance of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>The $\sigma$ hulls of matrix-product codes and related entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{SLAut}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n})$ denote the group of all semilinear isometries on $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$, where $q=p^{e}$ is a prime power. Matrix-product (MP) codes are a class of long classical codes generated by combining several commensurate classical codes with a defining matrix. We give an explicit formula for calculating the dimension of the $\sigma$ hull of a MP code. As a result, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the MP codes to be $\sigma$ dual-containing and $\sigma$ self-orthogonal. We prove that $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(\mathrm{Hull}_{\sigma}(\mathcal{C}))=\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(\mathrm{Hull}_{\sigma}(\mathcal{C}^{\bot_{\sigma}}))$. We prove that for any integer $h$ with $\mathrm{max}\{0,k_{1}-k_{2}\}\leq h\leq \mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(\mathcal{C}_{1}\cap\mathcal{C}_{2}^{\bot_{\sigma}})$, there exists a linear code $\mathcal{C}_{2,h}$ monomially equivalent to $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ such that $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(\mathcal{C}_{1}\cap\mathcal{C}_{2,h}^{\bot_{\sigma}})=h$, where $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ is an $[n,k_{i}]_{q}$ linear code for $i=1,2$. We show that given an $[n,k,d]_{q}$ linear code $\mathcal{C}$, there exists a monomially equivalent $[n,k,d]_{q}$ linear code $\mathcal{C}_{h}$, whose $\sigma$ dual code has minimum distance $d'$, such that there exist an $[[n,k-h,d;n-k-h]]_{q}$ EAQECC and an $[[n,n-k-h,d';k-h]]_{q}$ EAQECC for every integer $h$ with $0\leq h\leq \mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(\mathrm{Hull}_{\sigma}(\mathcal{C}))$. Based on this result, we present a general construction method for deriving EAQECCs with flexible parameters from MP codes related to $\sigma$ hulls.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Frequency-based Channels: Encoding Information in Molecular Concentrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a molecular channel, in which messages are encoded to the frequency of objects (or concentration of molecules) in a pool, and whose output during reading time is a noisy version of the input frequencies, as obtained by sampling with replacement from the pool. We tightly characterize the capacity of this channel using upper and lower bounds, when the number of objects in the pool of objects is constrained. We apply this result to the DNA storage channel in the short-molecule regime, and show that even though the capacity of this channel is technically zero, it can still achieve a large information density.</description>

      <title>Decoding Geometric Properties in Non-Random Data from First Information-Theoretic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the principles of information theory, measure theory, and theoretical computer science, we introduce a univariate signal deconvolution method with a wide range of applications to coding theory, particularly in zero-knowledge one-way communication channels, such as in deciphering messages from unknown generating sources about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our multidimensional space reconstruction method from an arbitrary received signal is proven to be agnostic vis-a-vis the encoding-decoding scheme, computation model, programming language, formal theory, the computable (or semi-computable) method of approximation to algorithmic complexity, and any arbitrarily chosen (computable) probability measure of the events. The method derives from the principles of an approach to Artificial General Intelligence capable of building a general-purpose model of models independent of any arbitrarily assumed prior probability distribution. We argue that this optimal and universal method of decoding non-random data has applications to signal processing, causal deconvolution, topological and geometric properties encoding, cryptography, and bio- and technosignature detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalization of the recently proposed quantum Tanner codes by Leverrier and Z\'emor, which contains a construction of asymptotically good quantum LDPC codes. Quantum Tanner codes have so far been constructed equivalently from groups, Cayley graphs, or square complexes constructed from groups. We show how to enlarge this to group actions on finite sets, Schreier graphs, and a family of square complexes which is the largest possible in a certain sense. Furthermore, we discuss how the proposed generalization opens up the possibility of finding other families of asymptotically good quantum codes.</description>

      <title>ISR: Invertible Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an Invertible Symbolic Regression (ISR) method. It is a machine learning technique that generates analytical relationships between inputs and outputs of a given dataset via invertible maps (or architectures). The proposed ISR method naturally combines the principles of Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) and Equation Learner (EQL), a neural network-based symbolic architecture for function learning. In particular, we transform the affine coupling blocks of INNs into a symbolic framework, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable symbolic invertible architecture that allows for efficient gradient-based learning. The proposed ISR framework also relies on sparsity promoting regularization, allowing the discovery of concise and interpretable invertible expressions. We show that ISR can serve as a (symbolic) normalizing flow for density estimation tasks. Furthermore, we highlight its practical applicability in solving inverse problems, including a benchmark inverse kinematics problem, and notably, a geoacoustic inversion problem in oceanography aimed at inferring posterior distributions of underlying seabed parameters from acoustic signals.</description>

      <title>Energy Reduction in Cell-Free Massive MIMO through Fine-Grained Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical layer foundations of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) have been well-established. As a next step, researchers are investigating practical and energy-efficient network implementations. This paper focuses on multiple sets of access points (APs) where user equipments (UEs) are served in each set, termed a federation, without inter-federation interference. The combination of federations and CF-mMIMO shows promise for highly-loaded scenarios. Our aim is to minimize the total energy consumption while adhering to UE downlink data rate constraints. The energy expenditure of the full system is modelled using a detailed hardware model of the APs. We jointly design the AP-UE association variables, determine active APs, and assign APs and UEs to federations. To solve this highly combinatorial problem, we develop a novel alternating optimization algorithm. Simulation results for an indoor factory demonstrate the advantages of considering multiple federations, particularly when facing large data rate requirements. Furthermore, we show that adopting a more distributed CF-mMIMO architecture is necessary to meet the data rate requirements. Conversely, if feasible, using a less distributed system with more antennas at each AP is more advantageous from an energy savings perspective.</description>

      <title>Multi-Relational Structural Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural Entropy (SE) measures the structural information contained in a graph. Minimizing or maximizing SE helps to reveal or obscure the intrinsic structural patterns underlying graphs in an interpretable manner, finding applications in various tasks driven by networked data. However, SE ignores the heterogeneity inherent in the graph relations, which is ubiquitous in modern networks. In this work, we extend SE to consider heterogeneous relations and propose the first metric for multi-relational graph structural information, namely, Multi-relational Structural Entropy (MrSE). To this end, we first cast SE through the novel lens of the stationary distribution from random surfing, which readily extends to multi-relational networks by considering the choices of both nodes and relation types simultaneously at each step. The resulting MrSE is then optimized by a new greedy algorithm to reveal the essential structures within a multi-relational network. Experimental results highlight that the proposed MrSE offers a more insightful interpretation of the structure of multi-relational graphs compared to SE. Additionally, it enhances the performance of two tasks that involve real-world multi-relational graphs, including node clustering and social event detection.</description>

      <title>A Pair of Bayesian Network Structures has Undecidable Conditional Independencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Bayesian network structure (directed acyclic graph), the celebrated d-separation algorithm efficiently determines whether the network structure implies a given conditional independence relation. We show that this changes drastically when we consider two Bayesian network structures instead. It is undecidable to determine whether two given network structures imply a given conditional independency, that is, whether every collection of random variables satisfying both network structures must also satisfy the conditional independency. Although the approximate combination of two Bayesian networks is a well-studied topic, our result shows that it is fundamentally impossible to accurately combine the knowledge of two Bayesian network structures, in the sense that no algorithm can tell what conditional independencies are implied by the two network structures. We can also explicitly construct two Bayesian network structures, such that whether they imply a certain conditional independency is unprovable in the ZFC set theory, assuming ZFC is consistent.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Compressive Sensing: Enabling Site-Specific MIMO Hybrid Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressive sensing is a promising solution for the channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with large antenna arrays and constrained hardware. Utilizing site-specific channel data from real-world systems, deep learning can be employed to learn the compressive sensing measurement vectors with minimum redundancy, thereby focusing sensing power on promising spatial directions of the channel. Collecting real-world channel data, however, is challenging due to the high overhead resulting from the large number of antennas and hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose leveraging a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic channel data, which shares a similar distribution with real-world data. The synthetic data is then used to train the deep learning models for learning measurement vectors and hybrid precoder/combiner design in an end-to-end manner. We further propose a model refinement approach to fine-tune the model pre-trained on the digital twin data with a small amount of real-world data. The evaluation results show that, by training the model on the digital twin data, the learned measurement vectors can be efficiently adapted to the environment geometry, leading to high performance of hybrid precoding for real-world deployments. Moreover, the model refinement approach can enable the digital twin aided model to achieve comparable performance to the model trained on the real-world dataset with a significantly reduced amount of real-world data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose fault-tolerant encoders for quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. By grouping qubits within a quantum code over contiguous blocks and applying preshared entanglement across these blocks, we show how transversal implementation can be realized. The proposed encoder reduces the error propagation while using multi-qubit gates and is applicable for both entanglement-unassisted and entanglement-assisted quantum LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Universal Batch Learning Under The Misspecification Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of universal {\em batch} learning in a misspecification setting with log-loss. In this setting the hypothesis class is a set of models $\Theta$. However, the data is generated by an unknown distribution that may not belong to this set but comes from a larger set of models $\Phi \supset \Theta$. Given a training sample, a universal learner is requested to predict a probability distribution for the next outcome and a log-loss is incurred. The universal learner performance is measured by the regret relative to the best hypothesis matching the data, chosen from $\Theta$. Utilizing the minimax theorem and information theoretical tools, we derive the optimal universal learner, a mixture over the set of the data generating distributions, and get a closed form expression for the min-max regret. We show that this regret can be considered as a constrained version of the conditional capacity between the data and its generating distributions set. We present tight bounds for this min-max regret, implying that the complexity of the problem is dominated by the richness of the hypotheses models $\Theta$ and not by the data generating distributions set $\Phi$. We develop an extension to the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm for numerical evaluation of the regret and its capacity achieving prior distribution. We demonstrate our results for the case where the observations come from a $K$-parameters multinomial distributions while the hypothesis class $\Theta$ is only a subset of this family of distributions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Wideband OFDM Communications: Circuit-Based Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the modeling and optimization of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which generalizes conventional RIS with diagonal phase shift matrices and provides additional flexibility for manipulating wireless channels, in wideband communication systems. Specifically, we start from the signal modeling of the BD-RIS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which bridges the time-domain and frequency-domain channels, and explicitly shows the frequency dependence of the BD-RIS response. We next characterize the frequency dependence of the BD-RIS response based on circuit models. Benefiting from the admittance parameter analysis, we model individually each tunable admittance component of BD-RIS and derive an approximated linear expression with respect to the frequency of the transmit signals. With the proposed signal model for the BD-RIS-aided OFDM system and the frequency-dependent BD-RIS model, we propose algorithms to optimize the BD-RIS and the power allocation at the transmitter to maximize the average rate for a BD-RIS-aided OFDM system. Finally, simulation results show that BD-RIS outperforms conventional RIS in the OFDM system. More importantly, the impact of wideband modeling of BD-RIS on the system performance becomes more significant as the circuit complexity of BD-RIS architectures increases.</description>

      <title>VALID: a Validated Algorithm for Learning in Decentralized Networks with Possible Adversarial Presence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of validated decentralized learning for undirected networks with heterogeneous data and possible adversarial infiltration. We require (a) convergence to a global empirical loss minimizer when adversaries are absent, and (b) either detection of adversarial presence of convergence to an admissible consensus irrespective of the adversarial configuration. To this end, we propose the VALID protocol which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve a validated learning guarantee. Moreover, VALID offers an O(1/T) convergence rate (under pertinent regularity assumptions), and computational and communication complexities comparable to non-adversarial distributed stochastic gradient descent. Remarkably, VALID retains optimal performance metrics in adversary-free environments, sidestepping the robustness penalties observed in prior byzantine-robust methods. A distinctive aspect of our study is a heterogeneity metric based on the norms of individual agents' gradients computed at the global empirical loss minimizer. This not only provides a natural statistic for detecting significant byzantine disruptions but also allows us to prove the optimality of VALID in wide generality. Lastly, our numerical results reveal that, in the absence of adversaries, VALID converges faster than state-of-the-art byzantine robust algorithms, while when adversaries are present, VALID terminates with each honest either converging to an admissible consensus of declaring adversarial presence in the network.</description>

Abstract: We provide an explicit expression for the modular hamiltonian of the von Neumann algebras associated to the unit double cone for the (fermionic) quantum field theories of the 2-component Weyl (helicity 1/2) field, and of the 4-component massless Dirac and Majorana fields. To this end, we represent the one particle spaces of these theories in terms of solutions of the corresponding wave equations, and obtain the action of the modular group on them. As an application, we compute the relative entropy between the vacuum of the massless Majorana field and one particle states associated to waves with Cauchy data localized in the spatial unit ball.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Informed Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the matrix completion problem, where the objective is to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a few observed entries. A commonly employed approach involves nuclear norm minimization. For this method to succeed, the number of observed entries needs to scale at least proportional to both the rank of the ground-truth matrix and the coherence parameter. While the only prior information is oftentimes the low-rank nature of the ground-truth matrix, in various real-world scenarios, additional knowledge about the ground-truth low-rank matrix is available. For instance, in collaborative filtering, Netflix problem, and dynamic channel estimation in wireless communications, we have partial or full knowledge about the signal subspace in advance. Specifically, we are aware of some subspaces that form multiple angles with the column and row spaces of the ground-truth matrix. Leveraging this valuable information has the potential to significantly reduce the required number of observations. To this end, we introduce a multi-weight nuclear norm optimization problem that concurrently promotes the low-rank property as well the information about the available subspaces. The proposed weights are tailored to penalize each angle corresponding to each basis of the prior subspace independently. We further propose an optimal weight selection strategy by minimizing the coherence parameter of the ground-truth matrix, which is equivalent to minimizing the required number of observations. Simulation results validate the advantages of incorporating multiple weights in the completion procedure. Specifically, our proposed multi-weight optimization problem demonstrates a substantial reduction in the required number of observations compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmitter Design and Pilot Spacing in MIMO Non-Stationary Aging Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers an uplink wireless communication system where multiple users with multiple antennas transmit data frames over dynamic channels. Previous studies have shown that multiple transmit and receive antennas can substantially enhance the sum-capacity of all users when the channel is known at the transmitter and in the case of uncorrelated transmit and receive antennas. However, spatial correlations stemming from close proximity of transmit antennas and channel variation between pilot and data time slots, known as channel aging, can substantially degrade the transmission rate if they are not properly into account. In this work, we provide an analytical framework to concurrently exploit both of these features. Specifically, we first propose a beamforming framework to capture spatial correlations. Then, based on random matrix theory tools, we introduce a deterministic expression that approximates the average sum-capacity of all users. Subsequently, we obtain the optimal values of pilot spacing and beamforming vectors upon maximizing this expression. Simulation results show the impacts of path loss, velocity of mobile users and Rician factor on the resulting sum-capacity and underscore the efficacy of our methodology compared to prior works.</description>

      <title>Localized Adaptive Risk Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Risk Control (ARC) is an online calibration strategy based on set prediction that offers worst-case deterministic long-term risk control, as well as statistical marginal coverage guarantees. ARC adjusts the size of the prediction set by varying a single scalar threshold based on feedback from past decisions. In this work, we introduce Localized Adaptive Risk Control (L-ARC), an online calibration scheme that targets statistical localized risk guarantees ranging from conditional risk to marginal risk, while preserving the worst-case performance of ARC. L-ARC updates a threshold function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), with the kernel determining the level of localization of the statistical risk guarantee. The theoretical results highlight a trade-off between localization of the statistical risk and convergence speed to the long-term risk target. Thanks to localization, L-ARC is demonstrated via experiments to produce prediction sets with risk guarantees across different data subpopulations, significantly improving the fairness of the calibrated model for tasks such as image segmentation and beam selection in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Compensation of Phase Noise in Massive-MIMO Uplink Communications Based on Expectation-Maximization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase noise (PN) is a major disturbance in MIMO systems, where the contribution of different oscillators at the transmitter and the receiver side may degrade the overall performance and offset the gains offered by MIMO techniques. This is even more crucial in the case of massive MIMO, since the number of PN sources may increase considerably. In this work, we propose an iterative receiver based on the application of the expectation-maximization algorithm. We consider a massive MIMO framework with a general association of oscillators to antennas, and include other channel disturbances like imperfect channel state information and Rician block fading. At each receiver iteration, given the information on the transmitted symbols, steepest descent is used to estimate the PN samples, with an optimized adaptive step size and a threshold-based stopping rule. The results obtained for several test cases show how the bit error rate and mean square error can benefit from the proposed phase-detection algorithm, even to the point of reaching the same performance as in the case where no PN is present, offering better results than a state-of-the-art alternative. Further analysis of the results allow to draw some useful trade-offs respecting final performance and consumption of resources.</description>

Abstract: We study the universal coding under side-channel attacks posed and investigated by Oohama and Santoso (2022). They proposed a theoretical security model for Shannon cipher system under side-channel attacks, where the adversary is not only allowed to collect ciphertexts by eavesdropping the public communication channel, but is also allowed to collect the physical information leaked by the devices where the cipher system is implemented on such as running time, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, etc. For any distributions of the plain text, any noisy channels through which the adversary observe the corrupted version of the key, and any measurement device used for collecting the physical information, we can derive an achievable rate region for reliability and security such that if we compress the ciphertext with rate within the achievable rate region, then: (1) anyone with secret key will be able to decrypt and decode the ciphertext correctly, but (2) any adversary who obtains the ciphertext and also the side physical information will not be able to obtain any information about the hidden source as long as the leaked physical information is encoded with a rate within the rate region.</description>

      <title>An Achievable and Analytic Solution to Information Bottleneck for Gaussian Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a remote source coding scenario in which binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation sources are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). An intermediate node, such as a relay, receives these observations and performs additional compression to balance complexity and relevance. This problem can be further formulated as an information bottleneck (IB) problem with Bernoulli sources and Gaussian mixture observations. However, no closed-form solution exists for this IB problem. To address this challenge, we propose a unified achievable scheme that employs three different compression/quantization strategies for intermediate node processing by using two-level quantization, multi-level deterministic quantization, and soft quantization with the hyperbolic tangent ($\tanh$) function, respectively. In addition, we extend our analysis to the vector mixture Gaussian observation problem and explore its application in machine learning for binary classification with information leakage. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed scheme has a near-optimal performance over various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), compared to the Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, and has better performance than some existing numerical methods such as the information dropout approach. Furthermore, experiments conducted on the realistic MNIST dataset also validate the superior classification accuracy of our method compared to the information dropout approach.</description>

Abstract: Iterative decoder failures of quantum low density parity check (QLDPC) codes are attributed to substructures in the code's graph, known as trapping sets, as well as degenerate errors that can arise in quantum codes. Failure inducing sets are subsets of codeword coordinates that, when initially in error, lead to decoding failure in a trapping set. The purpose of this paper is to examine failure inducing sets of QLDPC codes under syndrome-based iterative decoding. As for classical LDPC codes, we show that absorbing sets play a central role in understanding decoder failures. Raveendran and Vasi\~c initiated the study of quantum trapping sets, where beyond the classical-type trapping sets, they identified rigid symmetric structures (a.k.a symmetric stabilizers) responsible for degenerate errors. In this paper, we show that this behavior is part of a much more general phenomenon that can be described by the absorbing set framework.</description>

Abstract: Physical-layer security (PLS) is a promising technique to complement more traditional means of communication security in beyond-5G wireless networks. However, studies of PLS are often based on ideal assumptions such as infinite coding blocklengths or perfect knowledge of the wiretap link's channel state information (CSI). In this work, we study the performance of finite blocklength (FBL) transmissions using a new secrecy metric $\unicode{x2013}$ the average information leakage (AIL). We evaluate the exact and approximate AIL with Gaussian signaling and arbitrary fading channels, assuming that the eavesdropper's instantaneous CSI is unknown. We then conduct case studies that use artificial noise (AN) beamforming to analyze the AIL in both Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. The accuracy of the analytical expressions is verified through extensive simulations, and various insights regarding the impact of key system parameters on the AIL are obtained. Particularly, our results reveal that allowing a small level of AIL can potentially lead to significant reliability enhancements. To improve the system performance, we formulate and solve an average secrecy throughput (AST) optimization problem via both non-adaptive and adaptive design strategies. Our findings highlight the significance of blocklength design and AN power allocation, as well as the impact of their trade-off on the AST.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Positioning and Attitude Sensing Based on Electromagnetic Propagation Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positioning and sensing over wireless networks are imperative for many emerging applications. However, since traditional wireless channel models over-simplify the user equipment (UE) as a point target, they cannot be used for sensing the attitude of the UE, which is typically described by the spatial orientation. In this paper, a comprehensive electromagnetic propagation modeling (EPM) based on electromagnetic theory is developed to precisely model the near-field channel. For the noise-free case, the EPM model establishes the non-linear functional dependence of observed signals on both the position and attitude of the UE. To address the difficulty in the non-linear coupling, we first propose to divide the distance domain into three regions, separated by the defined Phase ambiguity distance and Spacing constraint distance. Then, for each region, we obtain the closed-form solutions for joint position and attitude estimation with low complexity. Next, to investigate the impact of random noise on the joint estimation performance, the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) is derived to yield useful insights. The expected Cram\'er-Rao bound (ECRB) is further provided to obtain the simplified closed-form expressions for the performance lower bounds. Our numerical results demonstrate that the derived ZZB can provide accurate predictions of the performance of estimators in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. More importantly, we achieve the millimeter-level accuracy in position estimation and attain the 0.1-level accuracy in attitude estimation.</description>

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in future wireless systems. The larger array aperture of XL-MIMO makes communication scenarios closer to the near-field region. Therefore, near-field resource allocation is essential in realizing the above key performance indicators (KPIs). Moreover, the overall performance of XL-MIMO systems heavily depends on the channel characteristics of the selected users, eliminating interference between users through beamforming, power control, etc. The above resource allocation issue constitutes a complex joint multi-objective optimization problem since many variables and parameters must be optimized, including the spatial degree of freedom, rate, power allocation, and transmission technique. In this article, we review the basic properties of near-field communications and focus on the corresponding "resource allocation" problems. First, we identify available resources in near-field communication systems and highlight their distinctions from far-field communications. Then, we summarize optimization tools, such as numerical techniques and machine learning methods, for addressing near-field resource allocation, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. Finally, several important research directions of near-field communications are pointed out for further investigation.</description>

Abstract: Pseudo-random arrays and perfect maps are the two-dimensional analogs of M-sequences and de Bruijn sequences, respectively. We modify the definitions to be applied to codes. These codes are also the two-dimensional analogs of certain factors in the de Bruijn graph. These factors are called zero factors and perfect factors in the de Bruijn graph. We apply a folding technique to construct pseudo-random array codes and examine the minimum distance of the constructed codes. The folding is applied on sequences generated from irreducible polynomials or a product of irreducible polynomials with the same degree and the same exponent. Direct and recursive constructions for de Bruijn array codes are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Protecting the Future of Information: LOCO Coding With Error Detection for DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA strands serve as a storage medium for $4$-ary data over the alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$. DNA data storage promises formidable information density, long-term durability, and ease of replicability. However, information in this intriguing storage technology might be corrupted. Experiments have revealed that DNA sequences with long homopolymers and/or with low $GC$-content are notably more subject to errors upon storage.
  This paper investigates the utilization of the recently-introduced method for designing lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes in DNA data storage. This paper introduces DNA LOCO (D-LOCO) codes, over the alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$ with limited runs of identical symbols. These codes come with an encoding-decoding rule we derive, which provides affordable encoding-decoding algorithms. In terms of storage overhead, the proposed encoding-decoding algorithms outperform those in the existing literature. Our algorithms are readily reconfigurable. D-LOCO codes are intrinsically balanced, which allows us to achieve balancing over the entire DNA strand with minimal rate penalty. Moreover, we propose four schemes to bridge consecutive codewords, three of which guarantee single substitution error detection per codeword. We examine the probability of undetecting errors. We also show that D-LOCO codes are capacity-achieving and that they offer remarkably high rates at moderate lengths.</description>

Abstract: The Sibson and Arimoto capacity, which are based on the Sibson and Arimoto mutual information (MI) of order {\alpha}, respectively, are well-known generalizations of the channel capacity C. In this study, we derive novel alternating optimization algorithms for computing these capacities by providing new variational characterizations of the Sibson and Arimoto MI. Moreover, we prove that all iterative algorithms for computing these capacities are equivalent under appropriate conditions imposed on their initial distributions.</description>

      <title>An Efficient, High-Rate Scheme for Private Information Retrieval over the Gaussian MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisited the problem of Private Information Retrieval (PIR), where there are $N$ replicated non-communicating databases containing the same $M$ messages and a user who wishes to retrieve one of the messages without revealing the wanted message's index to the databases. However, we assume a block-fading additive white Gaussian noise multiple access channel (AWGN MAC) linking the user and the databases. Previous work \cite{shmuel2021private} presented a joint channel-PIR scheme, utilizing the Compute and Forward protocol, showing the potential of a joint channel-PIR scheme over a separated one. This paper proposes an improved joint scheme tailored for the PIR problem with $N$ databases over a block-fading AWGN. Unlike the C\&amp;F protocol, our scheme offers reduced computational complexity while improving the scaling laws governing the achievable rate. Specifically, the achievable rate scales with the number of databases $N$ and the power $P$ similarly to the channel capacity without the privacy constraint and outperforms the C\&amp;F-based approach. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that the improved rate exhibits only a finite gap from the unconstrained channel capacity -- one bit per second per Hz as $N$ increases.</description>

      <title>On Achievable Rates for the Shotgun Sequencing Channel with Erasures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In shotgun sequencing, the input string (typically, a long DNA sequence composed of nucleotide bases) is sequenced as multiple overlapping fragments of much shorter lengths (called \textit{reads}). Modelling the shotgun sequencing pipeline as a communication channel for DNA data storage, the capacity of this channel was identified in a recent work, assuming that the reads themselves are noiseless substrings of the original sequence. Modern shotgun sequencers however also output quality scores for each base read, indicating the confidence in its identification. Bases with low quality scores can be considered to be erased. Motivated by this, we consider the \textit{shotgun sequencing channel with erasures}, where each symbol in any read can be independently erased with some probability $\delta$. We identify achievable rates for this channel, using a random code construction and a decoder that uses typicality-like arguments to merge the reads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider channel coding for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) with a novel cost constraint that constrains both the mean and the variance of the cost of the codewords. We show that the maximum (asymptotically) achievable rate under the new cost formulation is equal to the capacity-cost function; in particular, the strong converse holds. We further characterize the optimal second-order coding rate of these cost-constrained codes; in particular, the optimal second-order coding rate is finite. We then show that the second-order coding performance is strictly improved with feedback using a new variation of timid/bold coding, significantly broadening the applicability of timid/bold coding schemes from unconstrained compound-dispersion channels to all cost-constrained channels. Equivalent results on the minimum average probability of error are also given.</description>

      <title>Explicit Good Codes Approaching Distance 1 in Ulam Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ulam distance of two permutations on $[n]$ is $n$ minus the length of their longest common subsequence. In this paper, we show that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists some $\alpha&gt;0$, and an infinite set $\Gamma\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, such that for all $n\in\Gamma$, there is an explicit set $C_n$ of $(n!)^{\alpha}$ many permutations on $[n]$, such that every pair of permutations in $C_n$ has pairwise Ulam distance at least $(1-\varepsilon)\cdot n$. Moreover, we can compute the $i^{\text{th}}$ permutation in $C_n$ in poly$(n)$ time and can also decode in poly$(n)$ time, a permutation $\pi$ on $[n]$ to its closest permutation $\pi^*$ in $C_n$, if the Ulam distance of $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ is less than $ \frac{(1-\varepsilon)\cdot n}{4} $.
  Previously, it was implicitly known by combining works of Goldreich and Wigderson [Israel Journal of Mathematics'23] and Farnoud, Skachek, and Milenkovic [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'13] in a black-box manner, that it is possible to explicitly construct $(n!)^{\Omega(1)}$ many permutations on $[n]$, such that every pair of them have pairwise Ulam distance at least $\frac{n}{6}\cdot (1-\varepsilon)$, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and the bound on the distance can be improved to $\frac{n}{4}\cdot (1-\varepsilon)$ if the construction of Goldreich and Wigderson is directly analyzed in the Ulam metric.</description>

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) has emerged as a technology enabling wave domain beamforming through multiple stacked reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). SIM has been implemented so far with diagonal RIS (D-RIS), while SIM implemented with beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) remains unexplored. Furthermore, a model of SIM accounting for mutual coupling is not yet available. To fill these gaps, we derive a physically consistent channel model for SIM-aided systems and clarify the assumptions needed to obtain the simplified model used in related works. Using this model, we show that 1-layer SIM implemented with BD-RIS achieves the performance upper bound with limited complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this study, in order to get better codes, we focus on double skew cyclic codes over the ring $\mathrm{R}= \mathbb{F}_q+v\mathbb{F}_q, ~v^2=v$ where $q$ is a prime power. We investigate the generator polynomials, minimal spanning sets, generator matrices, and the dual codes over the ring $\mathrm{R}$. As an implementation, the obtained results are illustrated with some good examples. Moreover, we introduce a construction for new generator matrices and thus achieve codes with improved parameters compared to those found in existing literature. Finally, we tabulate our obtained block codes over the ring $\mathrm{R}$.</description>

      <title>Optimum Achievable Rates in Two Random Number Generation Problems with $f$-Divergences Using Smooth R\'enyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two typical fixed-length random number generation problems in information theory are considered for general sources. One is the source resolvability problem and the other is the intrinsic randomness problem. In each of these problems, the optimum achievable rate with respect to the given approximation measure is one of our main concerns and has been characterized using two different information quantities: the information spectrum and the smooth R\'enyi entropy. Recently, optimum achievable rates with respect to $f$-divergences have been characterized using the information spectrum quantity. The $f$-divergence is a general non-negative measure between two probability distributions on the basis of a convex function $f$. The class of f-divergences includes several important measures such as the variational distance, the KL divergence, the Hellinger distance and so on. Hence, it is meaningful to consider the random number generation problems with respect to $f$-divergences. However, optimum achievable rates with respect to $f$-divergences using the smooth R\'enyi entropy have not been clarified yet in both of two problems. In this paper we try to analyze the optimum achievable rates using the smooth R\'enyi entropy and to extend the class of $f$-divergence. To do so, we first derive general formulas of the first-order optimum achievable rates with respect to $f$-divergences in both problems under the same conditions as imposed by previous studies. Next, we relax the conditions on $f$-divergence and generalize the obtained general formulas. Then, we particularize our general formulas to several specified functions $f$. As a result, we reveal that it is easy to derive optimum achievable rates for several important measures from our general formulas. Furthermore, a kind of duality between the resolvability and the intrinsic randomness is revealed in terms of the smooth R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <title>Timely Status Updates in Slotted ALOHA Networks With Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the age of information (AoI) in a scenario where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a gateway following the slotted ALOHA protocol and receive no feedback. We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-leakage by R\'{e}nyi Divergence and Sibson Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00423v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\tilde{f}(t) = \exp(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}t)$, this paper proposes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain measure. R\'{e}nyi divergence is shown to be the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain incurred at each elementary event $y$ of channel output $Y$ and Sibson mutual information is the $\tilde{f}$-mean of this $Y$-elementary information gain. Both are proposed as $\alpha$-leakage measures, indicating the most information an adversary can obtain on sensitive data. It is shown that the existing $\alpha$-leakage by Arimoto mutual information can be expressed as $\tilde{f}$-mean measures by a scaled probability. Further, Sibson mutual information is interpreted as the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain over all estimation decisions applied to channel output. This reveals that the exiting generalized Blahut-Arimoto method for computing R\'{e}nyi capacity (or Gallager's error exponent) in fact maximizes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain iteratively over estimation decision and channel input. This paper also derives a decomposition of $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain, analogous to the Sibson identity for R\'{e}nyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Sampling to Achieve the Goal: An Age-aware Remote Markov Decision Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) has been recognized as an important metric to measure the freshness of information. Central to this consensus is that minimizing AoI can enhance the freshness of information, thereby facilitating the accuracy of subsequent decision-making processes. However, to date the direct causal relationship that links AoI to the utility of the decision-making process is unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper provides a sampling-control co-design problem, referred to as an age-aware remote Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, to explore this unexplored relationship. Our framework revisits the sampling problem in [1] with a refined focus: moving from AoI penalty minimization to directly optimizing goal-oriented remote decision-making process under random delay. We derive that the age-aware remote MDP problem can be reduced to a standard MDP problem without delays, and reveal that treating AoI solely as a metric for optimization is not optimal in achieving remote decision making. Instead, AoI can serve as important side information to facilitate remote decision making.</description>

Abstract: The matrix-product (MP) code $\mathcal{C}_{A,k}:=[\mathcal{C}_{1},\mathcal{C}_{2},\ldots,\mathcal{C}_{k}]\cdot A$ with a non-singular by column (NSC) matrix $A$ plays an important role in constructing good quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we study the MP code when the defining matrix $A$ satisfies the condition that $AA^{\dag}$ is $(D,\tau)$-monomial. We give an explicit formula for calculating the dimension of the Hermitian hull of a MP code. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions that a MP code is Hermitian dual-containing (HDC), almost Hermitian dual-containing (AHDC), Hermitian self-orthogonal (HSO), almost Hermitian self-orthogonal (AHSO), and Hermitian LCD, respectively. We theoretically determine the number of all possible ways involving the relationships among the constituent codes to yield a MP code with these properties, respectively. We give alternative necessary and sufficient conditions for a MP code to be AHDC and AHSO, respectively, and show several cases where a MP code is not AHDC or AHSO. We provide the construction methods of HDC and AHDC MP codes, including those with optimal minimum distance lower bounds.</description>

      <title>A Distributionally Robust Approach to Shannon Limits using the Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the rate-distortion function for lossy source compression, as well as the channel capacity for error correction, through the lens of distributional robustness. We assume that the distribution of the source or of the additive channel noise is unknown and lies within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set of a given radius centered around a specified nominal distribution, and we look for the worst-case asymptotically optimal coding rate over such an ambiguity set. Varying the radius of the ambiguity set allows us to interpolate between the worst-case and stochastic scenarios using probabilistic tools. Our problem setting fits into the paradigm of compound source / channel models introduced by Sakrison and Blackwell, respectively. This paper shows that if the nominal distribution is Gaussian, then so is the worst-case source / noise distribution, and the compound rate-distortion / channel capacity functions admit convex formulations with Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints. These formulations yield simple closed-form expressions in the scalar case, offering insights into the behavior of Shannon limits with the changing radius of the Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set.</description>

      <title>On Existence of Latency Optimal Uncoded Storage Schemes in Geo-Distributed Data Storage Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of geographically distributed data storage in a network of servers (or nodes) where the nodes are connected to each other via communication links having certain round-trip times (RTTs). Each node serves a specific set of clients, where a client can request for any of the files available in the distributed system. The parent node provides the requested file if available locally; else it contacts other nodes that have the data needed to retrieve the requested file. This inter-node communication incurs a delay resulting in a certain latency in servicing the data request. The worst-case latency incurred at a servicing node and the system average latency are important performance metrics of a storage system, which depend not only on inter-node RTTs, but also on how the data is stored across the nodes. Data files could be placed in the nodes as they are, i.e., in uncoded fashion, or can be coded and placed. This paper provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of uncoded storage schemes that are optimal in terms of both per-node worst-case latency and system average latency. In addition, the paper provides efficient binary storage codes for a specific case where optimal uncoded schemes do not exist.</description>

      <title>Regret Bounds for Noise-Free Cascaded Kernelized Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider optimizing a function network in the noise-free grey-box setting with RKHS function classes, where the exact intermediate results are observable. We assume that the structure of the network is known (but not the underlying functions comprising it), and we study three types of structures: (1) chain: a cascade of scalar-valued functions, (2) multi-output chain: a cascade of vector-valued functions, and (3) feed-forward network: a fully connected feed-forward network of scalar-valued functions. We propose a sequential upper confidence bound based algorithm GPN-UCB along with a general theoretical upper bound on the cumulative regret. In addition, we propose a non-adaptive sampling based method along with its theoretical upper bound on the simple regret for the Mat\'ern kernel. We also provide algorithm-independent lower bounds on the simple regret and cumulative regret. Our regret bounds for GPN-UCB have the same dependence on the time horizon as the best known in the vanilla black-box setting, as well as near-optimal dependencies on other parameters (e.g., RKHS norm and network length).</description>

      <title>Quantum dichotomies and coherent thermodynamics beyond first-order asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of exact and approximate transformation of quantum dichotomies in the asymptotic regime, i.e., the existence of a quantum channel $\mathcal E$ mapping $\rho_1^{\otimes n}$ into $\rho_2^{\otimes R_nn}$ with an error $\epsilon_n$ (measured by trace distance) and $\sigma_1^{\otimes n}$ into $\sigma_2^{\otimes R_n n}$ exactly, for a large number $n$. We derive second-order asymptotic expressions for the optimal transformation rate $R_n$ in the small, moderate, and large deviation error regimes, as well as the zero-error regime, for an arbitrary pair $(\rho_1,\sigma_1)$ of initial states and a commuting pair $(\rho_2,\sigma_2)$ of final states. We also prove that for $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ given by thermal Gibbs states, the derived optimal transformation rates in the first three regimes can be attained by thermal operations. This allows us, for the first time, to study the second-order asymptotics of thermodynamic state interconversion with fully general initial states that may have coherence between different energy eigenspaces. Thus, we discuss the optimal performance of thermodynamic protocols with coherent inputs and describe three novel resonance phenomena allowing one to significantly reduce transformation errors induced by finite-size effects. What is more, our result on quantum dichotomies can also be used to obtain, up to second-order asymptotic terms, optimal conversion rates between pure bipartite entangled states under local operations and classical communication.</description>

      <title>Transition Role of Entangled Data in Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as the resource to empower quantum computing. Recent progress has highlighted its positive impact on learning quantum dynamics, wherein the integration of entanglement into quantum operations or measurements of quantum machine learning (QML) models leads to substantial reductions in training data size, surpassing a specified prediction error threshold. However, an analytical understanding of how the entanglement degree in data affects model performance remains elusive. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by establishing a quantum no-free-lunch (NFL) theorem for learning quantum dynamics using entangled data. Contrary to previous findings, we prove that the impact of entangled data on prediction error exhibits a dual effect, depending on the number of permitted measurements. With a sufficient number of measurements, increasing the entanglement of training data consistently reduces the prediction error or decreases the required size of the training data to achieve the same prediction error. Conversely, when few measurements are allowed, employing highly entangled data could lead to an increased prediction error. The achieved results provide critical guidance for designing advanced QML protocols, especially for those tailored for execution on early-stage quantum computers with limited access to quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Formal Safety Guarantees via Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box zero-th order optimization is a central primitive for applications in fields as diverse as finance, physics, and engineering. In a common formulation of this problem, a designer sequentially attempts candidate solutions, receiving noisy feedback on the value of each attempt from the system. In this paper, we study scenarios in which feedback is also provided on the safety of the attempted solution, and the optimizer is constrained to limit the number of unsafe solutions that are tried throughout the optimization process. Focusing on methods based on Bayesian optimization (BO), prior art has introduced an optimization scheme -- referred to as SAFEOPT -- that is guaranteed not to select any unsafe solution with a controllable probability over feedback noise as long as strict assumptions on the safety constraint function are met. In this paper, a novel BO-based approach is introduced that satisfies safety requirements irrespective of properties of the constraint function. This strong theoretical guarantee is obtained at the cost of allowing for an arbitrary, controllable but non-zero, rate of violation of the safety constraint. The proposed method, referred to as SAFE-BOCP, builds on online conformal prediction (CP) and is specialized to the cases in which feedback on the safety constraint is either noiseless or noisy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data validate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed SAFE-BOCP.</description>

      <title>Co(ve)rtex: ML Models as storage channels and their (mis-)applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are overparameterized to support generality and avoid overfitting. The state of these parameters is essentially a "don't-care" with respect to the primary model provided that this state does not interfere with the primary model. In both hardware and software systems, don't-care states and undefined behavior have been shown to be sources of significant vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a new information theoretic perspective of the problem; we consider the ML model as a storage channel with a capacity that increases with overparameterization. Specifically, we consider a sender that embeds arbitrary information in the model at training time, which can be extracted by a receiver with a black-box access to the deployed model. We derive an upper bound on the capacity of the channel based on the number of available unused parameters. We then explore black-box write and read primitives that allow the attacker to:(i) store data in an optimized way within the model by augmenting the training data at the transmitter side, and (ii) to read it by querying the model after it is deployed. We also consider a new version of the problem which takes information storage covertness into account. Specifically, to obtain storage covertness, we introduce a new constraint such that the data augmentation used for the write primitives minimizes the distribution shift with the initial (baseline task) distribution. This constraint introduces a level of "interference" with the initial task, thereby limiting the channel's effective capacity. Therefore, we develop optimizations to improve the capacity in this case, including a novel ML-specific substitution based error correction protocol. We believe that the proposed modeling of the problem offers new tools to better understand and mitigate potential vulnerabilities of ML, especially in the context of increasingly large models.</description>

      <title>TexShape: Information Theoretic Sentence Embedding for Language Models</title>

Abstract: With the exponential growth in data volume and the emergence of data-intensive applications, particularly in the field of machine learning, concerns related to resource utilization, privacy, and fairness have become paramount. This paper focuses on the textual domain of data and addresses challenges regarding encoding sentences to their optimized representations through the lens of information-theory. In particular, we use empirical estimates of mutual information, using the Donsker-Varadhan definition of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our approach leverages this estimation to train an information-theoretic sentence embedding, called TexShape, for (task-based) data compression or for filtering out sensitive information, enhancing privacy and fairness. In this study, we employ a benchmark language model for initial text representation, complemented by neural networks for information-theoretic compression and mutual information estimations. Our experiments demonstrate significant advancements in preserving maximal targeted information and minimal sensitive information over adverse compression ratios, in terms of predictive accuracy of downstream models that are trained using the compressed data.</description>

      <title>Probability Tools for Sequential Random Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first probabilistic framework tailored for sequential random projection, an approach rooted in the challenges of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. The analysis is complicated by the sequential dependence and high-dimensional nature of random variables, a byproduct of the adaptive mechanisms inherent in sequential decision processes. Our work features a novel construction of a stopped process, facilitating the analysis of a sequence of concentration events that are interconnected in a sequential manner. By employing the method of mixtures within a self-normalized process, derived from the stopped process, we achieve a desired non-asymptotic probability bound. This bound represents a non-trivial martingale extension of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, marking a pioneering contribution to the literature on random projection and sequential analysis.</description>

      <title>Joint AP-UE Association and Power Factor Optimization for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14693v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uplink sum-throughput of distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) networks depends majorly on Access point (AP)-User Equipment (UE) association and power control. The AP-UE association and power control both are important problems in their own right in distributed mMIMO networks to improve scalability and reduce front-haul load of the network, and to enhance the system performance by mitigating the interference and boosting the desired signals, respectively. Unlike previous studies, which focused primarily on addressing these two problems separately, this work addresses the uplink sum-throughput maximization problem in distributed mMIMO networks by solving the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, while maintaining Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements for each UE. To improve scalability, we present an l1-penalty function that delicately balances the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and front-haul signaling load. Our proposed methodology leverages fractional programming, Lagrangian dual formation, and penalty functions to provide an elegant and effective iterative solution with guaranteed convergence. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed technique for maximizing sum-throughput while considering the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, demonstrating its superiority over approaches that address these problems individually. Furthermore, the results show that the introduced penalty function can help us effectively control the maximum front-haul load.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every m-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Such a state spans a pure [[n,0,m+1]] quantum error correcting code (QECC). Starting with an m-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we construct codeword stabilized (CWS) codes that are pure [[n,k,m+1]] QECCs. We propose measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and recovery of logical qubits from code states. Our proposed protocols support sequential encoding and partial recovery of logical qubits, which can be useful for quantum memory applications.</description>
