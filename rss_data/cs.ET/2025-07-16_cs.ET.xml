      <title>Fault-Free Analog Computing with Imperfect Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for edge computing and AI drives research into analog in-memory computing using memristors, which overcome data movement bottlenecks by computing directly within memory. However, device failures and variations critically limit analog systems' precision and reliability. Existing fault-tolerance techniques, such as redundancy and retraining, are often inadequate for high-precision applications or scenarios requiring fixed matrices and privacy preservation. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fault-free matrix representation where target matrices are decomposed into products of two adjustable sub-matrices programmed onto analog hardware. This indirect, adaptive representation enables mathematical optimization to bypass faulty devices and eliminate differential pairs, significantly enhancing computational density. Our memristor-based system achieved &gt;99.999% cosine similarity for a Discrete Fourier Transform matrix despite 39% device fault rate, a fidelity unattainable with conventional direct representation, which fails with single device faults (0.01% rate). We demonstrated 56-fold bit-error-rate reduction in wireless communication and &gt;196% density with 179% energy efficiency improvements compared to state-of-the-art techniques. This method, validated on memristors, applies broadly to emerging memories and non-electrical computing substrates, showing that device yield is no longer the primary bottleneck in analog computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand As Well As Apply Patent Regulations to Pass a Hands-On Patent Attorney Test?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.</description>

      <title>SPICEAssistant: LLM using SPICE Simulation Tools for Schematic Design of Switched-Mode Power Supplies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) show high performance across a wide range of tasks in many domains of science. In the field of electronic design automation (EDA), it is yet to be determined to what extent they are capable to understand, adapt, and dimension electronic circuits. This paper focuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Particular challenges for LLMs in this context include their limited ability to interpret results from key simulation tools like SPICE and the multi-step design process. To address these challenges, we suggest SPICEAssistant, a framework that provides a broad selection of tools to an LLM. The tools serve as an interface to SPICE, allowing the LLM to interact flexibly with the simulator to estimate the impact of its modifications to the circuit. To evaluate the performance of SPICEAssistant, we defined a benchmark consisting of 256 questions testing the ability to adapt circuit netlists to fulfil different SMPS design tasks. The benchmarking results show that simulation feedback effectively improves SMPS design capabilities of LLMs. An increasing number of simulation iterations leads to enhanced performance. The SPICEAssistant framework significantly outperforms the standalone LLM GPT-4o on the benchmark by approximately 38%.</description>

      <title>Exploring User Security and Privacy Attitudes and Concerns Toward the Use of General-Purpose LLM Chatbots for Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individuals are increasingly relying on large language model (LLM)-enabled conversational agents for emotional support. While prior research has examined privacy and security issues in chatbots specifically designed for mental health purposes, these chatbots are overwhelmingly "rule-based" offerings that do not leverage generative AI. Little empirical research currently measures users' privacy and security concerns, attitudes, and expectations when using general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots to manage and improve mental health. Through 21 semi-structured interviews with U.S. participants, we identified critical misconceptions and a general lack of risk awareness. Participants conflated the human-like empathy exhibited by LLMs with human-like accountability and mistakenly believed that their interactions with these chatbots were safeguarded by the same regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as disclosures with a licensed therapist. We introduce the concept of "intangible vulnerability," where emotional or psychological disclosures are undervalued compared to more tangible forms of information (e.g., financial or location-based data). To address this, we propose recommendations to safeguard user mental health disclosures with general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots more effectively.</description>

      <title>"Is it always watching? Is it always listening?" Exploring Contextual Privacy and Security Concerns Toward Domestic Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10786v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality.</description>

      <title>Automated Thematic Analyses Using LLMs: Xylazine Wound Management Social Media Chatter Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set, GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score: 0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use: 16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for qualitative research.

      <title>Stochastic Entanglement Configuration for Constructive Entanglement Topologies in Quantum Machine Learning with Application to Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.</description>

      <title>Uniting the World by Dividing it: Federated Maps to Enable Spatial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the Spatial Web -- the Web where content is tied to real-world locations has the potential to improve and enable many applications such as augmented reality, navigation, robotics, and more. The Spatial Web is missing a key ingredient that is impeding its growth -- a spatial naming system to resolve real-world locations to names. Today's spatial naming systems are digital maps such as Google and Apple maps. These maps and the location-based services provided on top of these maps are primarily controlled by a few large corporations and mostly cover outdoor public spaces. Emerging classes of applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, require detailed maps of both outdoor and indoor spaces. Existing centralized mapping infrastructures are proving insufficient for such applications because of the scale of cartography efforts required and the privacy of indoor map data.
  In this paper, we present a case for a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. This enables disparate parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions and unlocks scalability of map management, isolation and privacy of maps. Map-related services such as address-to-location mapping, location-based search, and routing needs re-architecting to work on federated maps. We discuss some essential services and practicalities of enabling these services.</description>
