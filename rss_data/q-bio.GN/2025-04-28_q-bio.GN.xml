      <title>Pan-genome Analysis of Angiosperm Plastomes using PGR-TK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for taxonomic analysis of chloroplast genomes in angiosperms using the Pan-genome Research Toolkit (PGR-TK). Comparative plots generated by PGR-TK across diverse angiosperm genera reveal a wide range of structural complexity, from straightforward to highly intricate patterns. Notably, the characteristic quadripartite plastome structure, comprising the large single copy (LSC), small single copy (SSC), and inverted repeat (IR) regions, is clearly identifiable in over 75% of the genera analyzed. Our findings also underscore several occurrences of species mis-annotations in public genomic databases, which are readily detected through visual anomalies in the PGR-TK plots. While more complex plot patterns remain difficult to interpret, they likely reflect underlying biological variation or technical inconsistencies in genome assembly. Overall, this approach effectively integrates classical botanical visualization with modern molecular taxonomy, providing a powerful tool for genome-based classification in plant systematics.</description>

      <title>On learning functions over biological sequence space: relating Gaussian process priors, regularization, and gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires "gauge-fixing," i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized "weight space" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in "function space," i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally, we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Overall, our framework unifies and extends our ability to infer and interpret sequence-function relationships.</description>
