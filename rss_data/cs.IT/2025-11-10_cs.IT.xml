      <title>Sharing Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces in Multi-Operator Communication Systems for Sustainable 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) in multi-operator communication systems for 6G networks, focusing on sustainable and efficient resource management. This research is motivated by two critical challenges: limited coverage provided by mmWave frequencies and high infrastructure costs associated with current technologies. IRSs can help eliminate these issues because they can reflect electromagnetic waves to enhance signal propagation, thereby reducing blockages and extending network coverage. However, deploying a separate IRS for each mobile network operator (MNO) can result in inefficiencies, redundant infrastructure, potential conflicts over placement, and interoperator interference. To address these challenges, in this study, an IRS sharing system is proposed in which multiple MNOs collaborate to use a common IRS infrastructure. This approach not only enhances network flexibility and reduces costs but also minimizes the effect of interoperator interference. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that IRS sharing effectively balances performance and fairness among MNOs, outperforming MNO-specific deployment methods in multi-MNO scenarios. This study provides insights into the potential of IRS sharing to support sustainable 6G networks, thereby contributing to the efficient deployment and operation of next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Adjoint and duality for rank-metric codes in a skew polynomial framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew polynomial rings provide a fundamental example of noncommutative principal ideal domains. Special quotients of these rings yield matrix algebras that play a central role in the theory of rank-metric codes. Recent breakthroughs have shown that specific subsets of these quotients produce the largest known families of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes. In this work, we present a systematic study of transposition and duality operations within quotients of skew polynomial rings. We develop explicit skew-polynomial descriptions of the transpose and dual code constructions, enabling us to determine the adjoint and dual codes associated with the MRD code families recently introduced by Sheekey et al. Building on these results, we compute the nuclear parameters of these codes, and prove that, for a new infinite set of parameters, many of these MRD codes are inequivalent to previously known constructions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Rank Ratio: A Novel Entropy-Based Perspective for DNA Complexity and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon entropy is widely used to measure the complexity of DNA sequences but suffers from saturation effects that limit its discriminative power for long uniform segments. We introduce a novel metric, the entropy rank ratio R, which positions a target sequence within the full distribution of all possible sequences of the same length by computing the proportion of sequences that have an entropy value equal to or lower than that of the target. In other words, R expresses the relative position of a sequence within the global entropy spectrum, assigning values close to 0 for highly ordered sequences and close to 1 for highly disordered ones. DNA sequences are partitioned into fixed-length subsequences and non-overlapping n-mer groups; frequency vectors become ordered integer partitions and a combinatorial framework is used to derive the complete entropy distribution. Unlike classical measures, R is a normalized, distribution-aware measure bounded in [0,1] at fixed (T,n), which avoids saturation to log2 4 and makes values comparable across sequences under the same settings. We integrate R into data augmentation for convolutional neural networks by proposing ratio-guided cropping techniques and benchmark them against random, entropy-based, and compression-based methods. On two independent datasets, viral genes and human genes with polynucleotide expansions, models augmented via R achieve substantial gains in classification accuracy using extremely lightweight architectures.</description>

      <title>Shortest self-orthogonal embeddings of binary linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in the study of shortest self-orthogonal embeddings of binary linear codes, since many such codes are optimal self-orthogonal codes. Several authors have studied the length of a shortest self-orthogonal embedding of a given binary code $\mathcal C$, or equivalently, the minimum number of columns that must be added to a generator matrix of $\mathcal C$ to form a generator matrix of a self-orthogonal code. In this paper, we use properties of the hull of a linear code to determine the length of a shortest self-orthogonal embedding of any binary linear code. We focus on the examples of Hamming codes and Reed-Muller codes. We show that a shortest self-orthogonal embedding of a binary Hamming code is self-dual, and propose two algorithms to construct self-dual codes from Hamming codes $\mathcal H_r$. Using these algorithms, we construct a self-dual $[22, 11, 6]$ code, called the shortened Golay code, from the binary $[15, 11, 3]$ Hamming code $\mathcal H_4$, and construct a self-dual $[52, 26, 8]$ code from the binary $[31, 26, 3]$ Hamming code $\mathcal H_5$. We use shortest SO embeddings of linear codes to obtain many inequivalent optimal self-orthogonal codes of dimension $7$ and $8$ for several lengths. Four of the codes of dimension $8$ that we construct are codes with new parameters such as $[91, 8, 42],\, [98, 8, 46],\,[114, 8, 54]$, and $[191, 8, 94]$.</description>

      <title>Communication-Constrained Private Decentralized Online Personalized Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of communication-constrained collaborative personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown agent-specific distributions. A consensus-based algorithm is studied under the framework of differential privacy in order to protect each agent's data. We give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some restrictions on the privacy level and the agents' connectivity, which illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results.</description>

      <title>Cross-link RTS/CTS for MLO mm-Wave WLANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directional RTS/CTS mechanism of mm-wave Wi-Fi hardly resolves the hidden terminal problem perfectly.This paper proposes cross-link RTS/CTS under multi-link operation (MLO) to address this problem and introduces a novel point process, named the generalized RTS/CTS hard-core process (G-HCP), to model the spatial transceiver relationships under the RTS/CTS mechanism, including the directional case and the omnidirectional case.Analytical expressions are derived for the intensity, the mean interference, an approximation of the success probability, and the expected number of hidden nodes for the directional RTS/CTS mechanism.Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the performance difference between two RTS/CTS mechanisms.The cross-link RTS/CTS mechanism ensures higher link quality at the cost of reduced network throughput.In contrast, the directional RTS/CTS sacrifices the link quality for higher throughput.Our study reveals a fundamental trade-off between link reliability and network throughput, providing critical insights into the selection and optimization of RTS/CTS mechanisms in next-generation WLAN standards.</description>

      <title>Confidentiality in a Card-Based Protocol Under Repeated Biased Shuffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a probabilistic analysis of the confidentiality in a card-based protocol. We focus on Bert den Boer's original Five Card Trick to develop our approach. Five Card Trick was formulated as a secure two-party computation method, where two players use colored cards with identical backs to calculate the logical AND operation on the bits that they choose. In this method, the players first arrange the cards privately, and then shuffle them through a random cut. Finally, they reveal the shuffled arrangement to determine the result of the operation. An unbiased random cut is essential to prevent players from exposing their chosen bits to each other. However, players typically choose to move cards within the deck even though not moving any cards should be equally likely. This unconscious behavior results in a biased, nonuniform shuffling-distribution in the sense that some arrangements of cards are slightly more probable after the cut. Such a nonuniform distribution creates an opportunity for a malicious player to gain advantage in guessing the other player's choice. We provide the conditional probabilities of such guesses as a way to quantify the information leakage. Furthermore, we utilize the eigenstructure of a Markov chain to derive tight bounds on the number of times the biased random cuts must be repeated to reduce the leakage to an acceptable level. We also discuss the generalization of our approach to the setting where shuffling is conducted by a malicious player.</description>

      <title>Deterministic list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Reed-Solomon codes of dimension $k$ and block length $n$ over any finite field $\mathbb{F}$ can be deterministically list decoded from agreement $\sqrt{(k-1)n}$ in time $\text{poly}(n, \log |\mathbb{F}|)$.
  Prior to this work, the list decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes, from the celebrated results of Sudan and Guruswami-Sudan, were either randomized with time complexity $\text{poly}(n, \log |\mathbb{F}|)$ or were deterministic with time complexity depending polynomially on the characteristic of the underlying field. In particular, over a prime field $\mathbb{F}$, no deterministic algorithms running in time $\text{poly}(n, \log |\mathbb{F}|)$ were known for this problem.
  Our main technical ingredient is a deterministic algorithm for solving the bivariate polynomial factorization instances that appear in the algorithm of Sudan and Guruswami-Sudan with only a $\text{poly}(\log |\mathbb{F}|)$ dependence on the field size in its time complexity for every finite field $\mathbb{F}$. While the question of obtaining efficient deterministic algorithms for polynomial factorization over finite fields is a fundamental open problem even for univariate polynomials of degree $2$, we show that additional information from the received word can be used to obtain such an algorithm for instances that appear in the course of list decoding Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Information Reconciliation for Decoy-State Quantum Key Distribution over a Satellite Downlink Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic solution that leverages the properties of quantum mechanics to be resistant and secure even against an attacker with unlimited computational power. Satellite-based links are important in QKD because they can reach distances that the best fiber systems cannot. However, links between satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and ground stations have a duration of only a few minutes, resulting in the generation of a small amount of secure keys. In this context, we investigate the optimization of the information reconciliation step of the QKD post-processing in order to generate as much secure key as possible. As a first step, we build an accurate model of the downlink signal and quantum bit error rate (QBER) during a complete satellite pass, which are time-varying due to three effects: (i) the varying link geometry over time, (ii) the scintillation effect, and (iii) the different signal intensities adopted in the Decoy-State protocol. Leveraging the a-priori information on the instantaneous QBER, we improve the efficiency of information reconciliation (IR) (i.e., the error correction phase) in the Decoy-State BB84 protocol, resulting in a secure key that is almost 3\% longer for realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Strong Converse Exponent and Error Exponent of the Classical Soft Covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the exact strong converse exponent of the soft covering problem in the classical setting. This exponent characterizes the slowest achievable convergence speed of the total variation to one when a code of rate below mutual information is applied to a discrete memoryless channel for synthesizing a product output distribution. The proposed exponent is expressed through a new two-parameter information quantity, differing from the more commonly studied R\'enyi divergence or R\'enyi mutual information. In addition, we demonstrate the non-tightness of random coding for rates both below and above mutual information. Discussions on the latter start with noiseless channels, where we develop a deterministic code construction that outperforms random codes in error exponents. We further observe that the conventional formulation, which assumes a uniform distribution over messages, inherently introduces a discrepancy in error exponents depending on whether the components of the target distribution are rational or irrational numbers. To eliminate this discrepancy, we propose a new formulation in which messages are allowed to be distributed non-uniformly, and the rate is given by the logarithm of the smallest nonzero message probability (corresponding to R\'enyi entropy $H_{-\infty}$ of order $-\infty$). The exact error exponent is characterized in this formulation for noiseless channels. Furthermore, for noisy channels, we provide a high-rate improvement in achievability and derive a converse bound on the error exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study peak Age of Information (PAoI) violation guarantee in a periodic multi-source status update system. The system is served by a shared base station, which requires scheduling. Our main contribution is a randomized scheduling framework that targets heterogeneous PAoI requirements. To that end, we derive numerically trackable upper bounds on the PAoI violation probability in two traffic regimes (long and short period) by leveraging the multivariate noncentral hypergeometric Wallenius distribution and the geometric distribution, respectively. Guided by these bounds, we design two low-complexity randomized scheduling schemes that meet diverse PAoI violation probability targets without the traffic assumption. Simulations validate the bounds and demonstrate feasible operation across a wide range of configurations.</description>

      <title>Models, Methods and Waveforms for Estimation and Prediction of Doubly Sparse Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates channel estimation for linear time-varying (LTV) wireless channels under double sparsity, i.e., sparsity in both the delay and Doppler domains. An on-grid approximation is first considered, enabling rigorous hierarchical-sparsity modeling and compressed sensing-based channel estimation. Guaranteed recovery conditions are provided for affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier modulation (SCM), highlighting the superiority of AFDM in terms of doubly sparse channel estimation. To address arbitrary Doppler shifts, a relaxed version of the on-grid model is introduced by making use of multiple elementary Expansion Models (BEM) each based on Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS). Next, theoretical guarantees are provided for the precision of this off-grid model before further extending it to tackle channel prediction by exploiting the inherent DPSS extrapolation capability. Finally, numerical results are provided to both validate the proposed off-grid model for channel estimation and prediction purposes under the double sparsity assumption and to compare the corresponding mean squared error (MSE) and the overhead performance when the different wireless waveforms are used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To time-efficiently and stably acquire the intensity information for phase retrieval under a coherent illumination, we leverage an event-based vision sensor (EVS) that can detect changes in logarithmic intensity at the pixel level with a wide dynamic range. In our optical system, we translate the EVS along the optical axis, where the EVS records the intensity changes induced by defocus as events. To recover phase distributions, we formulate a partial differential equation, referred to as the transport of event equation, which presents a linear relationship between the defocus events and the phase distribution. We demonstrate through experiments that the EVS is more advantageous than the conventional image sensor for rapidly and stably detecting the intensity information, defocus events, which enables accurate phase retrieval, particularly under low-lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>ProFL: Performative Robust Optimal Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework that captures distribution shifts that occur during the training of machine learning models due to their deployment. As the trained model is used, data generation causes the model to evolve, leading to deviations from the original data distribution. The impact of such model-induced distribution shifts in federated learning is increasingly likely to transpire in real-life use cases. A recently proposed approach extends performative prediction to federated learning with the resulting model converging to a performative stable point, which may be far from the performative optimal point. Earlier research in centralized settings has shown that the performative optimal point can be achieved under model-induced distribution shifts, but these approaches require the performative risk to be convex and the training data to be noiseless, assumptions often violated in realistic federated learning systems. This paper overcomes all of these shortcomings and proposes Performative Robust Optimal Federated Learning, an algorithm that finds performative optimal points in federated learning from noisy and contaminated data. We present the convergence analysis under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which applies to non-convex objectives. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the advantage of Robust Optimal Federated Learning over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Lossy Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed. This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First, by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting the problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively high losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.</description>

      <title>Linear codes arising from the point-hyperplane geometry-Part I: the Segre embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements and $\Lambda$ be the image of the Segre geometry $\mathrm{PG}(V)\otimes\mathrm{PG}(V^*)$ in $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$. Consider the subvariety $\Lambda_{1}$ of $\Lambda$ represented by the pure tensors $x\otimes \xi$ with $x\in V$ and $\xi\in V^*$ such that $\xi(x)=0$. Regarding $\Lambda_1$ as a projective system of $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$, we study the linear code $\mathcal{C}(\Lambda_1)$ arising from it. The code $\mathcal{C}(\Lambda_1)$ is minimal code and we determine its basic parameters, itsfull weight list and its linear automorphism group. We also give a geometrical characterization of its minimum and second lowest weight codewords as well as of some of the words of maximum weight.</description>

      <title>Bounding quantum uncommon information with quantum neural estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural architectures.</description>
