      <title>Quantitative diagnosis of amyloid without Congo red staining using polarized light microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amyloidosis is a protein misfolding disease caused by the deposition of large, insoluble aggregates (amyloid fibrils) of protein in a tissue, which has been associated with various conditions, such as lymphoid disorders, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic inflammatory processes, and cancers. Amyloid fibrils are commonly diagnosed by qualitative observation of green birefringence from Congo red stained biopsy tissue samples under polarized light, a technique that is limited by lack of specificity, dependence on subjective interpretation, and technical constraints. Studies emphasize the utility of quantitative polarized light microscopy (PLM) methodology to diagnose amyloid fibrils in Congo red stained tissues. However, while Congo red enhances the intrinsic birefringence of amyloid fibrillar structures, there are significant disadvantages such as the appearance of multiple non-green colors under polarized light and binding to other structures, which may result in misdiagnoses with Congo red dye and inconclusive explanations. In this work, we present an improved PLM methodology for quantitative detection of amyloid fibrils without requiring Congo red staining. We perform PLM measurements on four tissues: abdominal subcutaneous tissue biopsy, duodenal biopsy, thyroid biopsy, and breast biopsy, both with Congo red stain and H\&amp;E stain, and through Fourier analysis quantify birefringence, birefringent axis orientation, dichroism, optical activity, and relative amyloid density. These results emphasize a quantitative analysis for amyloid diagnosis rooted in Fourier signal harmonics that does not require Congo red dye and paves the way for rapid, simple, and accurate diagnosis of amyloid fibrils.</description>

      <title>Quantitative First-Pass Perfusion CMR: from technical principles to clinical practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myocardial perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (pCMR) using first-pass contrast-enhanced imaging could play an important role in the detection of epicardial and microvascular coronary artery disease. Recently, the emergence of quantitative pCMR has provided a more reliable and observer-independent analysis compared to visual interpretation of dynamic images. This review aims to cover the basics of quantitative pCMR, from acquisition protocols, its use in preclinical and clinical studies, image reconstruction and motion handling, to automated quantitative pCMR pipelines. It also offers an overview of emerging tools in the field, including artificial intelligence-based methods.</description>

      <title>$\textit{In vivo}$ fundus imaging and computational refocusing with a diffuser-based fundus camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00122v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significance: Access to diagnostic eye care could be expanded with high-throughput and easy-to-use tools. Phase mask-based imaging may improve the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing with no moving parts. While phase mask-based imaging has been demonstrated in a model eye, this approach has not been shown $\textit{in vivo}$.
  Aim: A computational fundus camera was designed, constructed, and evaluated with the goal of determining the feasibility and performance of phase mask-based computational imaging of the $\textit{in vivo}$ fundus.
  Approach: A holographic diffuser was introduced in a modified commercial fundus camera at a plane conjugate to the ocular pupil, resulting in a linear and shift-invariant point spread function that varies with refractive error. The image could be digitally refocused across a range of $\geq\pm$ 10 diopters of defocus error. The device was tested for ocular safety, and a human imaging pilot study was performed.
  Results: The device captured and digitally refocused color human fundus images. The field of view was $\geq$35 degrees and resolution was 7.7-9.6 line pairs per mm.
  Conclusions: We present the first $\textit{in vivo}$ diffuser-based fundus images, demonstrating the feasibility of computational imaging for ocular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for improving radiomic-based models in radiation pneumonitis prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a side effect of thoracic radiation therapy. Recently, Machine learning (ML) models enhanced with radiomic and dosiomic features provide better predictions by incorporating spatial information beyond DVHs. However, to improve the clinical decision process, we propose to use uncertainty quantification (UQ) to improve the confidence in model prediction. This study evaluates the impact of post hoc UQ methods on the discriminative performance and calibration of ML models for RP prediction. Methods: This study evaluated four ML models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and random forest (RF), using radiomic, dosiomic, and dosimetric features to predict RP. We applied UQ methods, including Patt scaling, isotonic regression, Venn-ABERS predictor, and Conformal Prediction, to quantify uncertainty. Model performance was assessed through Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV). Results: UQ methods enhanced predictive performance, particularly for high-certainty predictions, while also improving calibration. Radiomic and dosiomic features increased model accuracy but introduced calibration challenges, especially for non-linear models like XGB and RF. Performance gains from UQ methods were most noticeable at higher certainty thresholds. Conclusion: Integrating UQ into ML models with radiomic and dosiomic features improves both predictive accuracy and calibration, supporting more reliable clinical decision-making. The findings emphasize the value of UQ methods in enhancing applicability of predictive models for RP in healthcare settings.</description>
