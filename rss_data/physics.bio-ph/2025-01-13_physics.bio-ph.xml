      <title>Viral Lattice Theory: A Biophysical Model for Virion Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorously formulated operator-based framework that merges ideas from condensed matter physics, continuum mechanics, and quantum-inspired theory to analyze collective virion behavior in complex environments. By modeling metabolically inert virions, whose main interactions are Coulombic and Lennard-Jones, as nodes in a viral lattice linked by effective springs, we obtain collective vibrational modes akin to phonons in solids. A coupled, complex-valued displacement field PDE underpins our approach, enabling wave-mechanics and functional analysis to define key observables, ranging from stress fields and thermodynamic responses to effective Hamiltonians. We interpret the apparent stochasticity of virion motion as deterministic chaos arising from rapid transitions among "viral phonon" modes that store and redistribute energy from the host. Short-lived lattice states (milliseconds) may thus help sustain infectivity in aerosolized droplets of respiratory virions. Extending our operator framework, we derive an uncertainty-like relation coupling a virion's self-stiffness operator with its phononic frequency operator, underscoring fundamental limits on specifying capsid rigidity and vibrational response. We also explore transient coherence effects, akin to entanglement witness operators, which may expose critical correlations affecting capsid resilience or genome release. Our approach invites experimental validation via advanced imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and mechanical perturbations. By integrating aspects of soft matter physics, crystallography, statistical mechanics, and wave-based modeling, this methodology suggests new antiviral strategies targeting specific vibrational modes and guides the rational design of virus-based vectors in therapeutic or diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>A Mosquito-Inspired Theoretical Framework for Acoustic Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distortion products are tones produced through nonlinear effects of a system simultaneously detecting two or more frequencies. These combination tones are ubiquitous to vertebrate auditory systems and are generally regarded as byproducts of nonlinear signal amplification. It has previously been shown that several species of infectious-disease-carrying mosquitoes utilize these distortion products for detecting and locating potential mates. It has also been shown that their auditory systems contain multiple oscillatory components within the sensory structure, which respond at different frequency ranges. Using a generic theoretical model for acoustic detection, we show the signal-detection advantages that are implied by these two detection schemes: distortion product detection and cascading a signal through multiple layers of oscillator elements. Lastly, we show that the combination of these two schemes yields immense benefits for signal detection. These benefits could be essential for male mosquitoes to be able to identify and pursue a particular female within a noisy swarm environment.</description>

      <title>Channel deformations during elastocapillary spreading of gaseous embolisms in biomimetic leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleation and/or spreading of bubbles in water under tension (due to water evaporation) can be problematic for most plants along the ascending sap network from root to leaves, named xylem. Due to global warming, trees facing drought conditions are particularly threatened by the formation of such air embolisms, which spreads intermittently and hinder the flow of sap and could ultimately result in their demise. PDMS-based biomimetic leaves simulating evapotranspiration have demonstrated that, in a linear configuration, the existence of a slender constriction in the channel allows for the creation of intermittent embolism propagation (as an interaction between the elasticity of the biomimetic leaf (mainly the deformable ceiling of the microchannels) and the capillary forces at the air/water interfaces) \cite{Keiser2022}-\cite{keiser2024}. Here we use analog PDMS-based biomimetic leaves in 1d and 2d. To better explore the embolism spreading mechanism, we add to the setup an additional technique, allowing to measure directly the microchannel's ceiling deformation versus time, which corresponds to the pressure variations. We present here such a method that allows to have quantitative insights in the dynamics of embolism spreading. The coupling between channel deformations and the Laplace pressure threshold explains the observed elastocapillary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cellular dynamics emerging from turbulent flows steered by active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a continuum theory to describe the collective dynamics of deformable epithelial cells, using two tensor order parameters to distinguish the force-generating active filaments in the cells from their shape. The theory demonstrates how active flows create nematic domains of anisotropic cells, drive active turbulence, and create topological defects. We show that the filament flow-aligning parameter, $\lambda_{\tens{Q}}$, a rheological quantity that determines the response of the filaments to velocity gradients in the active flows, plays a significant, to date unappreciated, role in determining the pattern of extensional and compressional active flows. In a contractile cell layer, local flows are expected to align elongated cells perpendicular to the active filaments. However, with increasing $\lambda_{\tens{Q}}$, long-range correlations in the active turbulent flow field lead to extended regions where this alignment is parallel, as recently observed in experiments on confluent MDCK cell layers. Further, the two order parameter formalism allows us to distinguish defects in the filament director field, which contribute to the active driving, and those in the shape director field, measured in experiments, which are advected by the active flows. By considering the relative orientations of shape and filaments we are able to explain the surprising observation of defects moving towards their heads in contractile cell layers.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Transition to Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a formidable technique for non-invasively characterizing brain microstructure. Biophysical modelling is often necessary to gain specificity to cellular structure. However, designing sensible biophysical models and appropriate dMRI acquisitions is challenging, especially for gray matter (GM), as little is known about typical values of relevant features of braincell morphology contributing to dMRI signal.
  This work addressees this unmet need. We analysed about 3,500 cells from mouse, rat, monkey and human brains to determine statistical distributions of a set of morphological features (structural, topological and shape descriptors) relevant to GM microstructure modelling. Illustrative examples demonstrate how this study can inform biophysical modelling and important implications for biophysical modelling of GM are discussed, enabling the design of more sensible models and suitable data acquisitions.</description>
