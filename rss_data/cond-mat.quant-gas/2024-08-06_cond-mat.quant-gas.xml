      <title>Reliability of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in noninteger dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of the reliability of the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation for a mass-imbalanced resonant three-body system embedded in noninteger dimensions. We address this question within the problem of a system of currently experimental interest, namely $^7$Li$-^{87}$Rb$_2$. We compare the Efimov scale parameter as well as the wave functions obtained using the BO approximation with those obtained using the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Shear-Induced Decaying Turbulence in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the creation and breakdown of a quantized vortex shear layer forming between a stationary Bose-Einstein condensate and a stirred-in persistent current. Once turbulence is established, we characterize the progressive clustering of the vortices, showing that the cluster number follows a power law decay with time, similar to decaying turbulence in other two-dimensional systems. Numerical study of the system demonstrates good agreement of the experimental data with a point vortex model that includes damping and noise. With increasing vortex number in the computational model, we observe a convergence of the power-law exponent to a fixed value.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced unatomic trimer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature of an unatomic system is revealed by a continuous scale invariance that appears during a progressive dimensional squeezing of a resonantly interacting trimer. The unatomic regime is reached at the dimension $\overline D$, which for three identical atoms is found to be $\overline D=2.292$ - below this value, the trimer wave function at short distances displays a power-law behaviour. The fingerprint of this crossover is a sharp evolution of the contacts that characterizes the trimer momentum distribution tail.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phases of a BEC in a bad optical cavity at optomechanical resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of dynamical phases of a Bose-Einstein condensate that is optomechanically coupled to a dissipative cavity mode and transversally driven by a laser. We focus on the regime close to the optomechanical resonance, where the atoms' refractive index shifts the cavity into resonance, assuming fast cavity relaxation. We derive an effective model for the atomic motion, where the cavity degrees of freedom are eliminated using perturbation theory in the atom-cavity coupling and benchmark its predictions using numerical simulations based on the full model. Away from the optomechanical resonance, perturbation theory in the lowest order (adiabatic elimination) reliably describes the dynamics and predicts chaotic phases with unstable oscillations. Interestingly, the dynamics close to the optomechanical resonance are qualitatively captured only by including the corrections to next order (non-adiabatic corrections). In this regime we find limit cycle phases that describe stable oscillations of the density with a well defined frequency. We further show that such limit cycle solutions are metastable configurations of the adiabatic model. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms that are required to observe dynamical phases and predict their existence in atom-cavity systems where a substantial timescale separation is present.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic instabilities and turbulence of merged rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the simulation results of merging harmonically confined rotating Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions. Merging of the condensate is triggered by positioning the rotation axis at the trap minima and moving both condensates towards each other while slowly ramping their rotation frequency. We analyze the dynamics of the merged condensate by letting them evolve under a single harmonic trap. We systematically investigate the formation of solitonic and vortex structures in the final, unified condensate, considering both non-rotating and rotating initial states. In both cases, merging leads to the formation of solitons that decay into vortex pairs through snake instability, and subsequently, these pairs annihilate. Soliton formation and decay-induced phase excitations generate sound waves, more pronounced when the merging time is short. We witness no sound wave generation at sufficiently longer merging times that finally leads to the condensate reaching its ground state. With rotation, we notice off-axis merging (where the rotation axes are not aligned), leading to the distortion and weakening of soliton formation. The incompressible kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a Kolmogorov-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-5/3}$] in the initial stage for merging condensates rotating above a critical frequency and a Vinen-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-1}$] at a later time for all cases. Our findings hold potential significance for atomic interferometry, continuous atomic lasers, and quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Universal clusters in quasi-two-dimensional ultracold Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study universal clusters in quasi-two dimensions (q2D) that consist of a light (L) atom interacting with two or three heavy (H) identical fermions, forming the trimer or tetramer bound state. The axial confinement in q2D is shown to lift the three-fold degeneracy of 3D trimer (tetramer) in $p$-wave channel and uniquely select the ground state with magnetic angular momentum $|m|=1$ ($m=0$). By varying the interaction or confinement strength, we explore the dimensional crossover of these clusters from 3D to 2D, characterized by a gradual change of critical H-L mass ratio for their emergence and momentum-space distribution. Importantly, we find that a finite effective range will {\it not} alter their critical mass ratios in the weak coupling regime. There, we establish an effective 2D model to quantitatively reproduce the properties of q2D clusters, and further identify the optimal interaction strengths for their detections in experiments. Our results suggest a promising prospect for observing universal clusters and associated high-order correlation effects in realistic q2D ultracold Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Only-phase Popov action: thermodynamic derivation and superconducting electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a thermodynamic derivation of the only-phase Popov action functional, which is often adopted to study the low-energy effective hydrodynamics of a generic nonrelativistic superfluid. It is shown that the crucial assumption is the use of the saddle point approximation after neglecting the quantum-pressure term. As an application, we analyze charged superfluid (superconductors) coupled to the electromagnetic field at zero temperature. Our only-phase and minimally-coupled theory predicts the decay of the electrostatic field inside a superconductor with a characteristic length much smaller than the London penetration depth of the static magnetic field. This result is confirmed also by a relativistic only-phase Popov action we obtain from the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Strong Spin-Motion Coupling in the Ultrafast Dynamics of Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in optical lattices and tweezers is now a well established platform for simulating quantum spin systems. However, the role of the atoms' spatial wavefunction has not been examined in detail experimentally. Here, we show a strong spin-motion coupling emerging from the large variation of the interaction potential over the wavefunction spread. We observe its clear signature on the ultrafast many-body nanosecond-dynamics of atoms excited to a Rydberg $S$ state, using picosecond pulses, from an unity-filling atomic Mott-insulator. We also propose a novel approach to tune arbitrarily the strength of the spin-motion coupling relative to the motional energy scale set by trapping potentials. Our work provides a new direction for exploring the dynamics of strongly-correlated quantum systems by adding the motional degree of freedom to the Rydberg simulation toolbox.</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>
