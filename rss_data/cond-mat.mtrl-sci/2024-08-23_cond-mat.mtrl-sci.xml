      <title>Improved precision and accuracy of electron energy-loss spectroscopy quantification via fine structure fitting with constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By working out the Bethe sum rule, a boundary condition that takes the form of a linear equality is derived for the fine structure observed in ionization edges present in electron energy-loss spectra. This condition is subsequently used as a constraint in the estimation process of the elemental abundances, demonstrating starkly improved precision and accuracy and reduced sensitivity to the number of model parameters. Furthermore, the fine structure is reliably extracted from the spectra in an automated way, thus providing critical information on the sample's electronic properties that is hard or impossible to obtain otherwise. Since this approach allows dispensing with the need for user-provided input, a potential source of bias is prevented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prognosis and diagnosis play an important role in accelerating the development of lithium-ion batteries, as well as reliable and long-life operation. In this work, we answer an important question: What is the minimum amount of data required to extract features for accurate battery prognosis and diagnosis? Based on the first principle, we successfully extracted the best two-point feature (BTPF) for accurate battery prognosis and diagnosis using the fewest data points (only two) and the simplest feature selection method (Pearson correlation coefficient). The BTPF extraction method is tested on 820 cells from 6 open-source datasets (covering five different chemistry types, seven manufacturers, and three data types). It achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art features in both prognosis and diagnosis tasks. This work challenges the cognition of existing studies on the difficulty of battery prognosis and diagnosis tasks, subverts the fixed pattern of establishing prognosis and diagnosis methods for complex dynamic systems through deliberate feature engineering, highlights the promise of data-driven methods for field battery prognosis and diagnosis applications, and provides a new benchmark for future studies.</description>

      <title>Machine learning unveils the materials physical properties driving thermoelectric generators efficiency: half-Heuslers case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the machine learning (ML)-based approach allowing thermoelectric generator (TEG) efficiency evaluation directly from 5 parameters: 2 physical properties - carriers density and energy gap, and 3 engineering parameters - external load resistance, TEG hot side temperature and leg height. Then, we propose to use genetic algorithm to optimize the proposed parameters in a way to maximize TEG efficiency. To prepare data, physical properties of n- and p-type materials were computed by coupling Density Functional Theory to Boltzmann Transport, and used for Finite Elements simulations. TEG efficiency was evaluated from a finite elements model considering design, radiative heat loss, contacts, external load resistance and different combinations of materials, resulting in 5300 different scenarios. For ML model, physical properties and engineering parameters were used as input features, skipping transport coefficients, while TEG efficiency was a target. Model was built on gradient boosting algorithm, its performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination that reached a value of 0.98 on test dataset. Features importance analysis revealed the most crucial features for Half-Heusler-based TEG efficiency: carriers density or Fermi level, indicating the predominant role of electrical conductivity and electronic part of electrical conductivity. Features that were less important, but able to increase model performance were: energy gap, lattice thermal conductivity, charge carrier relaxation time and carriers conductivity effective mass. Features showed no impact were: density of states effective mass, heat capacity, density, relative permittivity and leg width. The proposed approach can be applied for the identification of the most important physical properties and their optimal values, the optimization of TEG design and operation conditions in a way to maximize TEG efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient nanoscale imaging of solid-state phase transitions by transmission electron microscopy demonstrated on vanadium dioxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) as an efficient, fast, and non-destructive nanoscale tool for monitoring solid-state phase transition. Using metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide nanoparticles as an example, we characterize lattice and electronic signatures of the phase transition using analytical transmission electron microscopy including diffraction and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. We demonstrate that ADF-STEM shows a clear contrast across the transition, interpreted with the help of convergent electron beam diffraction as stemming from the crystal-lattice modification accompanying the transition. In addition, ADF-STEM utilizes 3--6 orders of magnitude lower electron dose when compared to electron microscopy techniques able to reveal the phase transition with the same spatial resolution and universality. The benefits of ADF-STEM are emphasized by recording a full hysteresis loop for the metal-insulator transition of a single vanadium dioxide nanoparticle. Our study opens the prospect for fast, non-destructive, large-area and nanoscale characterization of solid-state phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Flat Band Generation through Interlayer Geometric Frustration in Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic flat bands can lead to rich many-body quantum phases by quenching the electron's kinetic energy and enhancing many-body correlation. The reduced bandwidth can be realized by either destructive quantum interference in frustrated lattices, or by generating heavy band folding with avoided band crossing in Moire superlattices. Here we propose a general approach to introduce flat bands into widely studied transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials by dilute intercalation, featuring both destructive interference and band folding. A flat band with vanishing dispersion is observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) over the entire momentum space in intercalated Mn1/4TaS2. Polarization dependent ARPES measurements combined with symmetry analysis reveal the orbital characters of the flat bands. Supercell tight-binding simulations suggest that such flat bands arise from destructive interference between Mn and Ta wave functions on the S hopping pathways and are ubiquitous in a range of TMD families as well as in different intercalation configurations. Our findings establish a new material platform to manipulate flat band structures and explore their corresponding emergent correlated properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic proximity coupling to defects in a two-dimensional semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrathin structure and efficient spin dynamics of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials hold unprecedented opportunities for ultrafast memory devices, artificial intelligence circuits, and novel computing technology. For example, chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4) is one of the most promising 2D A-type AFM materials due to its robust stability in diverse environmental conditions and net out-of-plane magnetic moment in each layer, attributed to anisotropy in crystal axes (a and b). However, their net zero magnetic moment poses a challenge for detecting the Neel state that is used to encode information. In this study, we demonstrate the detection of the Neel vector by detecting the magnetic order of the surface layer by employing defects in tungsten diselenide (WSe2). These defects are ideal candidates for optically active transducers to probe the magnetic order due to their narrow linewidth and high susceptibility to magnetic fields. We observed spin-polarized charge transfer in the heterostructure of bulk CrPS4 and single-layer WSe2 indicating type-II band alignment as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In the A-type AFM regime, the intensity of both right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized light emanating from the sample remains constant as a function of the applied magnetic field, indicating a constant polarized transition behavior. Our results showcase a new approach to optically characterizing the magnetic states of 2D bulk AFM material, highlighting avenues for future research and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional non-volatile valley spin valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin valve represents a well-established device concept in magnetic memory technologies, whose functionality is determined by electron transmission being controlled by the relative alignment of magnetic moments of the two ferromagnetic layers. Recently, the advent of valleytronics has conceptualized a valley spin valve (VSV) - a device that utilizes the valley degree of freedom and spin-valley locking to achieve a similar valve effect without relying on magnetism. In this study, we propose a non-volatile VSV (n-VSV) based on a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductor where the resistance of the n-VSV is controlled by the ferroelectric domain wall between the two uniformly polarized domains. Focusing on the 1T'' phase of MoS2, which is known to be ferroelectric down to a monolayer and using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the quantum-transport calculations, we demonstrate that switching between the uniformly polarized state and the state with oppositely polarized domains separated by a domain wall results in resistance change of as high as 10^7. This giant VSV effect occurs due to transmission being strongly dependent on matching (mismatching) the valley-dependent spin polarizations in the two domains with the same (opposite) ferroelectric polarization orientations, when the chemical potential of 1T''-MoS2 lies within the spin-split valleys. Our work paves a new route for realizing high-performance nonvolatile valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Group-IV ternary and binary semiconductors using epitaxy of $\rm GeH_3Cl$ and $\rm SnH_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$ alloys were grown on Ge buffer layers at ultra-low temperature using reactions of $\rm SnH_{4}$ and $\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ for the first time. The latter is a newly introduced CVD source designed for epitaxial development of group IV semiconductors under low thermal budgets and CMOS compatible conditions. The $\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$ films were produced between 160-200oC with 3-5% Si and ~ 5-11 % Sn, which traverses the indirect to direct gap transition in Ge-Sn materials. The films were fully strained to Ge and exhibited defect-free microstructures, flat surfaces, homogeneous compositions, uniform thicknesses and sharp interfaces as required for device manufacturing. A comparative study was then conducted to investigate the applicability of $\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ for the synthesis of $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ binaries under similar experimental conditions. The$\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ films were grown fully strained to Ge, but with reduced Sn compositions ranging from ~ 2 - 7 % and lower thicknesses relative to $\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$. This prompted efforts to further investigate the growth behavior of $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ using the $\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ method, bypassing the Ge buffer to produce samples directly on Si, with the aim of exploring how to manage interface strain. In this case the $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ on Si films exhibited compositions and thicknesses comparable to $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$-on-Ge films; however, their strain states were mostly relaxed, presumably due to the large misfit between $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ and Si. Efforts to increase the concentration and thickness of these samples resulted in non-homogeneous multi-phase materials containing large amounts of interstitial Sn impurities.</description>

      <title>Sr4Os3O12- A Layered Osmate (V,VI) that is Magnetic close to Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black crystals of the mixed-valence osmate(V,VI) Sr4Os3O12 were grown via a gas phase reaction in an evacuated silica tube. The material is attracted to a permanent magnet at room temperature (295 K) but loses this property when heated or cooled. In this temperature interval, soft magnetic behavior with vanishing coercivity is observed, but the saturation magnetization is only 0.05 MuB per formula unit. Resistivity measurements show that Sr4Os3O12 is a semiconductor with a small band gap of about 0.26 eV at room temperature. X-ray diffraction on a single-crystal revealed a rhombohedral structure with the space group R-3m and lattice parameters ar = 554.64(2) pm and cr = 2700.1(1) pm at 300(1) K. The compound crystallizes in the La4Ti3O12 structure type and is isostructural to Sr4CoRe2O12. The structure is a rhombohedral stack of layered blocks, each of which can be considered as a section of three layers of the cubic perovskite structure cut perpendicular to one of its threefold axes. The Os-O-Os bond angle of about 175{/deg} favors superexchange that leads to antiferromagnetic coupling between the osmium atoms with 5d3 and 5d2 configurations. Sr4Os3O12 exhibits strong lattice dynamics. One aspect is the antiferro-rotative lattice modes of the corner-sharing [OsO6] octahedra, which freeze upon cooling. At 100 K, an ordered, yet twinned triclinic superstructure is formed. Strong spin-orbit coupling and other effects cause deformations of the [OsO6] octahedra that differ significantly at 300 K and 100 K, suggesting a change in the electronic configuration. Competing ground states could also explain the temperature dependent band gap and the magnetic fluctuations manifested in the magnetization peak at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Mapping Hydrogen Evolution Activity Trends of V-based A15 Superconducting Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts is valuable for water-splitting technologies. Recently, Si-group compounds have attracted increasing attention in electrocatalysis, considering the abundant Si-group elements on Earth. However, Si-group compounds for HER electrocatalysis have not been systematically studied. In this study, we unveil the activity trends of non-noble metal catalyst A15-type V3M (i.e., V3Si, V3Ge, and V3Sn) superconductors and show that V3Si is the most efficient HER catalyst because of the high electronic conductivity and suitable d-band center. Among them, the V3Si only requires 33.4 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2, and only 57.6 mV and 114.6 mV are required to attain a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively. These low overpotentials are close to the 34.3 mV at 10 mA cm-2 of state-of-art Pt/C (20 %) but superior to 168.5 mV of Pt/C (20 %) at 100 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the V3Si illustrates exceptional durability with no obvious decay in the 120 h at the different current densities (i.e., 10 - 250 mA cm-2). The excellent HER activity of V3Si alloy can be ascribed to the synergies of superior electronic conductivity and suitable d-band center. Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the absolute hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy is decreased after introducing the V to Si. Beyond offering a stable and high-performance electrocatalyst in an acidic medium, this work inspires the rational design of desirable silicide electrocatalysts.</description>

Abstract: Oxygen transport membranes(OTMs)have provided great opportunities in the last decades but are suffering from the trade-off effect between stability and oxygen permeability. Here, we report a group of new planar dual-phase mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) OTMs consisting of CO$_2$$_{0.85}$Nd$_{0.1}$Cu$_{0.05}$O$_2$ (CNCO) and Nd$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$Fe$_{1-y}$Cu$_y$O$_3$(NSFCO; $x = 0.4, 0.6$; $y = 0.05, 0.1$) phases, showing excellent oxygen permeability while comparable CO$_2$-resistant stability. The substitution of Cu as a bifunctional additive decreases the sintering temperature and enhances bulk diffusion and oxygen permeability with the co-doping of Nd.The oxygen permeation fluxes reached 2.62 and 1.52 mL min$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ at 1000$^\circ$C through the optimal 60wt%Ce0.85Nd0.1Cu0.05O2-40wt%Nd0.4Sr0.6Fe0.9Cu0.1O3 (CNCO-NSFCO41) composition with He and CO$_2$ sweeping, respectively, higher than all reported dense dual-phase OTMs. Such excellent CO$_2$-tolerant permeability meets the needs of potential industrial applications. Analysis with Zhu's oxygen permeation model shows lower bulk diffusion resistance of CNCO-NSFCO41 than that of reported 60wt%Ce0.85Pr0.1Cu0.05O2-40wt%Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.9Cu0.1O3(CPCO-PSFCO41)and more limitation by the interfacial exchange at high temperature. All the prepared OTMs also show good long-term stability over 100 hours in both atmospheres. Our results confirm the excellent oxygen permeability and stability under a high-concentration CO2 atmosphere, providing a material candidate for CO2 capture in oxyfuel combustion.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Gilbert Damping in the CoFe/CuOx Orbital Torque System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-spin interconversion processes underpin the generation of spin-orbit torques in magnetic/nonmagnetic bilayers. However, efficient sources of spin currents such as 5d metals are also efficient spin sinks, resulting in a large increase of magnetic damping. Here we show that a partially-oxidized 3d metal can generate a strong orbital torque without a significant increase in damping. Measurements of the torque efficiency {\xi} and Gilbert damping {\alpha} in CoFe/CuOx and CoFe/Pt indicate that {\xi} is comparable. The increase in damping relative to a single CoFe layer is {\Delta}{\alpha}&lt;0.002 in CoFe/CuOx and {\Delta}{\alpha} ~ 0.005 - 0.02 in CoFe/Pt, depending on CoFe thickness. We ascribe the nonreciprocal relationship between {\Delta}{\alpha} and {\xi} in CoFe/CuOx to the small orbital-to-spin current ratio generated by magnetic resonance in CoFe and the lack of an efficient spin sink in CuOx. Our findings provide new perspectives on the efficient excitation of magnetization dynamics via the orbital torque.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of multi-principal-component alloys (MPCAs) as potential functional materials in research is still in its early phase, with most studies centred on their potential application as structural materials. Magnetic materials possessing superior performance characteristics are essential for functional applications. Experimental observations and ab-initio density functional theory calculations were used to design and investigate an MPCA, AlCuFeMn, based on the medium-entropy effect. This study examines the microstructure evolution, phase formation, and soft magnetic behaviour of a cast and annealed AlCuFeMn MPCA. We conducted first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations to explain a selected multi-phase alloy's atomic, electronic, and magnetic structures at absolute zero temperature to understand the experimental findings better. We verified the predictions based on DFT by comparing them with the experimental observations. Despite the emphasis on equimolar compositions, the findings and conclusions of this study can enhance phase prediction and magnetic characteristics in non-equimolar alloys.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based determination of magnetic parameters from magnetic images with different imaging scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of material parameters is significantly important in material science, which is often a challenging task. Recently, advancements have shown that magnetic parameters, such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), can be estimated from a magnetic domain image using machine learning (ML). This development suggests a potential shift in how magnetic parameters are determined, moving away from traditional measurement techniques to more innovative methods involving image-based inputs processed by ML. In previous studies, the test images used for estimation always matched the training images in size. However, since image size is contingent on the microscopy technique used, the ability to accurately estimate parameters from images of varying sizes is essential. Here, we investigated the feasibility of estimating the DMI constant and saturation magnetization from magnetic domain images of different sizes using ML. We successfully demonstrated that it is possible to estimate these parameters even when the imaging sizes differ between training and test datasets. Additionally, our comparison of the estimation accuracy for the DMI constant and saturation magnetization revealed that the tolerance for differences in image size varies depending on the specific parameter being estimated. These findings could have a significant impact on the future methods of determining magnetic parameters.</description>

      <title>Electron States Emerging at Magnetic Domain Wall of magnetic semiconductors with strong Rashba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we explore the electron properties of magnetic semiconductors with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling taking into account the presence of domain walls at the sample surface. We consider antiphase domain walls separating domains with both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization as well as noncollinear domain walls. First, we propose the model and unveil general physical picture of phenomenon supported by analytical arguments. Further, we perform a comprehensive tight-binding numerical calculations to provide a profound understanding of our findings. A domain wall separating domains with any polarization directions is demonstrated to host a bound state. What is more interesting is that we predict that either of these domain walls also induces one-dimensional resonant state. The surface energy spectrum and spin polarization of the states are highly sensitive to the magnetization orientation in the adjacent domains. The spectral broadening and the spatial localization of the resonant state depend significantly on a relation between the Rashba splitting and the exchange one. Our estimation shows that chiral conducting channels associated with the long-lived resonant states can emerge along the magnetic domain walls and can be accessed experimentally at the surface of BiTeI doped with transition metal atoms.</description>

      <title>Formation mechanism of the (2 x 1) reconstruction of calcite (104)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcite has recently attracted extensive research interest in fields ranging from geoscience to carbon dioxide removal. Although much effort has been made to study the (2x1) reconstruction of the most stable (104) surface, the origin of this reconstruction remains unclear. Here, we carefully investigate the atomic and electronic structures of calcite (104) via density functional theory methods with van der Waals corrections. The results unambiguously show that the driving force for this reconstruction is the intrinsic demands of surface atoms to increase the coordination numbers. On reconstructing, calcite (104) forms four additional Ca-O bonds per (2x1) unit cell. Besides, phonon spectrums indicate both unreconstructed and reconstructed surfaces are dynamically stable. Finally, by applying the climbing image nudged elastic band method, an energy barrier is predicted during the reconstructing. This work delivers a full picture for the formation of calcite (104)-(2x1) reconstruction and can greatly advance the understanding of surface science for calcite.</description>

      <title>Tuning THz magnons in a mixed van-der-Waals antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: Alloying stands out as a pivotal technological method employed across various compounds, be they metallic, magnetic, or semiconducting, serving to fine-tune their properties to meet specific requirements. Ternary semiconductors represent a prominent example of such alloys. They offer fine-tuning of electronic bands, the band gap in particular, thus granting the technology of semiconductor heterostructures devices, key elements in current electronics and optoelectronics. In the realm of magnetically ordered systems, akin to electronic bands in solids, spin waves exhibit characteristic dispersion relations, featuring sizeable magnon gaps in many antiferromagnets. The engineering of the magnon gap constitutes a relevant direction in current research on antiferromagnets, aiming to leverage their distinct properties for THz technologies, spintronics, or magnonics. In this study, we showcase the tunability of the magnon gap across the THz spectral range within an alloy comprising representative semiconducting van-der-Waals antiferromagnets FePS$_3$ and NiPS$_3$. These constituents share identical in-plane crystal structures, magnetic unit cells and the direction of the magnetic anisotropy, but differ in the amplitude and sign of the latter. Altogether these attributes result in the wide tunability of the magnon gap in the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$PS$_3$ alloy in which the magnetic order is imposed by stronger, perpendicular anisotropy of iron.</description>

      <title>The Critical Metallization of Hydrogen in Pressurized LaBeH8 Hydride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behaviours of hydrogen, such as fluidity and metallicity, are crucial for our understanding of planetary interiors and the emerging field of high-temperature superconducting hydrides. These behaviours were discovered in complex phase diagrams of hydrogen and hydrides, however, the transition mechanism of behaviours driven by temperature, pressure and chemical compression remain unclear, particularly in the processes of metallization. Until now, a comprehensive theoretical framework to quantify atomization and metallization of hydrogen in phase diagram of hydrides has been lacking. In this study, we address this gap by combining molecular dynamics and electronic structure analysis to propose a theoretical framework, which clarify the content and properties of atomic hydrogen under various temperature and pressure conditions and chemical compression exerted by non-hydrogen elements in hydrides. Applying this framework to the superconducting hydride LaBeH8, we identify three general hydrogen orderings within its phase diagram: molecular, sublattice and warm hydrogens. During the phase transition from molecule to sublattice, hydrogen exhibits different properties from three general hydrogen orderings, such as fast superionicity, metallicity and unusual atomic content response to temperature. These abnormal behaviours were defined as the critical metallization of hydrogen, which not only suggests a potential synthesis route for the metastable phase but also provides valuable insights into the complex synthetic products of superconducting hydrides.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Atomic-Scale Pathways Driving Pressure-Induced Phase Transitions in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon exhibits several metastable allotropes which recently attracted attention in the quest for materials with superior (e.g. optical) properties, compatible with Si technology. In this work we shed light on the atomic-scale mechanisms leading to phase transformations in Si under pressure. To do so, we synergically exploit different state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we use the advanced GAP interatomic potential both in NPT molecular dynamics simulations and in solid-state nudged elastic band calculations, validating our predictions with ab initio DFT calculations.
  We provide a link between evidence reported in experimental nanoindentation literature and simulation results. Particular attention is dedicated to the investigation of atomistic transition paths allowing for the transformation between BC8/R8 phases to the hd one under pure annealing. In this case we show a direct simulation of the local nucleation of the hexagonal phase in a BC8/R8 matrix and its corresponding atomic-scale mechanism extracted by the use of SS-NEB. We extend our study investigating the effect of pressure on the nucleation barrier, providing an argument for explaining the heterogeneous nucleation of the hd phase observed in experiments reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Density dependence of thermal conductivity in nanoporous and amorphous carbon with machine-learned molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered forms of carbon are an important class of materials for applications such as thermal management. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the structural dependence of thermal transport and the underlying microscopic mechanisms is lacking. Here we study the structure-dependent thermal conductivity of disordered carbon by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by a machine-learned interatomic potential based on the efficient neuroevolution potential approach. Using large-scale MD simulations, we generate realistic nanoporous carbon (NP-C) samples with density varying from $0.3$ to $1.5$ g cm$^{-3}$ dominated by sp$^2$ motifs, and amorphous carbon (a-C) samples with density varying from $1.5$ to $3.5$ g cm$^{-3}$ exhibiting mixed sp$^2$ and sp$^3$ motifs. Structural properties including short- and medium-range order are characterized by atomic coordination, pair correlation function, angular distribution function and structure factor. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method and the associated quantum-statistical correction scheme, we predict a linear and a superlinear density dependence of thermal conductivity for NP-C and a-C, respectively, in good agreement with relevant experiments. The distinct density dependences are attributed to the different impacts of the sp$^2$ and sp$^3$ motifs on the spectral heat capacity, vibrational mean free paths and group velocity. We additionally highlight the significant role of structural order in regulating the thermal conductivity of disordered carbon.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast quantum dynamics in $\mathbf{\mathrm{SrTiO_3}}$ under impulsive THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast spectroscopy paved the way for probing transient states of matter produced through photoexcitation. Despite significant advances, the microscopic processes governing the formation of these states remain largely unknown. This study discloses the nuclear quantum dynamics of $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ when excited by THz laser pumping. We use a first-principles machine-learning approach accounting for all atomistic degrees of freedom to examine the time-resolved energy flow across phonon modes following the photoexcitation, revealing the mechanism underpinning the observed phonon upconversion and quantifying the lifetime of the out-of-equilibrium motion. Crucially, our simulations predict that THz pump pulses can generate persistent out-of-equilibrium stress capable of inducing polar order. We observe a correlation between the experimentally measured lifetime of the transient inversion-symmetry-broken state and the duration of the out-of-equilibrium nuclear state. This work not only explains the experimental results on $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ but also establishes a framework for simulating the photoexcited quantum dynamics of nuclei from first principles without any empirical input. It lays the groundwork for systematic explorations of complex materials sensitive to photoexcitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon quasi-particles have been monumental in microscopically understanding thermodynamics and transport properties in condensed matter for decades. Phonons have one-to-one correspondence with harmonic eigenstates and their energies are often described by simple independent harmonic oscillator models. Higher order terms in the potential energy lead to interactions among them, resulting in finite lifetimes and frequency shifts, even in perfect crystals. However, increasing evidence including constant volume heat capacity different from the expected Dulong-Petit law suggests the need for re-evaluation of phonons having harmonic energies. In this work, we explicitly examine inter-mode dependence of phonon energies of a prototypical crystal, silicon, through energy covariance calculations and demonstrate the concerted nature of phonon energies even at 300 K, questioning independent harmonic oscillator assumptions commonly used for phonon energy descriptions of thermodynamics and transport.</description>

      <title>Determining van der Waals materials' optical and polaritonic properties using cryogenic FTIR micro-spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van-der-Waals materials have been shown to support numerous exotic polaritonic phenomena originating from their layered structures and associated vibrational and electronic properties. This includes emergent polaritonic phenomena, including hyperbolicity and exciton-polariton formation. However, many van-der-Waals materials' unique properties are most prominent at cryogenic temperatures. This presents a particular challenge for polaritonics research, as reliable optical constant data is required for understanding light-matter coupling. For infrared polaritonics (3-100um), the small size of exfoliated flakes makes conventional ellipsometry impossible. This paper presents a cryogenic Fourier transform infrared microscope design constructed entirely from off-the-shelf components and fitting procedures for determining optical constants. We use this microscope to present the first temperature-dependent characterization of the optical properties of hexagonal boron nitride grown with isotopically pure boron. We show that Fabry Perot-type resonances close to the transverse optical phonon show the key temperature-dependent tuning of several parameters. Our full analysis of the infrared dielectric function shows small but significant tuning of the optical constants, which is highly consistent with Raman data from the literature. We then use this dielectric data to perform and analyze the polariton propagation properties, which agree extremely well with published cryogenic scattering-type nearfield microscopy results. In addition to the insights gained into hyperbolic polaritons in hBN, our paper represents a transferable framework for characterizing exfoliated infrared polaritonic materials and other infrared devices. This could accelerate discoveries in other material systems, especially those that are spatially inhomogeneous or cannot be prepared as large single crystals.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation in graphite due to spin-orbital-phonon interaction from first-principles density-matrix approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict "intrinsic" spin relaxation times ($T_{1}$) of graphite due to spin-orbit-phonon interaction, i.e., the combination of spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interaction, using our developed first-principles density-matrix approach. We obtain ultralong $T_{1}$, e.g., $\sim$600 ns at 300 K, which leads to ultralong in-plane spin diffusion length $\sim$110 $\mu$m within the drift-diffusion model. Our prediction sets the upper bound of $T_{1}$ of graphite at each given temperature and Fermi level. The anisotropy ratios of $T_{1}$ or values of $T_{1z}/T_{1x}$ are found small and around 0.6. We examine the applicability of the well-known Elliot-Yafet (EY) relation, which declares that spin relaxation rate $T_{1\alpha}^{-1}$ ($\alpha=x,y,z$) is proportional to the product of the ensemble average of spin mixing parameter $\left\langle b_{\alpha}^{2}\right\rangle $ and carrier relaxation rate $\tau_{p}^{-1}$. Our numerical tests suggest that the EY relation works qualitatively if the degeneracy threshold $t^{\mathrm{deg}}$ for evaluating $b_{\alpha}^{2}$ is elatively large (not much smaller than or comparable to $k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-3}$ eV or larger, but fails if $t^{\mathrm{deg}}$ is too tiny (much smaller than $k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-6}$ eV or smaller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have successfully synthesized single crystals of the site-ordered cubic (C15b) Laves phase compound LuInCo$_4$ with the Co-pyrochlore sublattice for the first time. LuInCo$_4$ undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at 306 K and has a saturation moment of 3.43 $\mu_{\rm{B}}$/f.u. at 5 K. The strongly ferromagnetic nature was verified by DFT calculations, suggesting that Co-3$d$ flat bands near the Fermi level induce the spin polarization. The magnetization is isotropic above $\sim$100 K, saturates most easily in the [100] direction at low temperatures. In this anisotropic ferromagnetic state, the magnetization undergoes a metamagnetic transition in the [111] direction. Our results suggest that LuInCo$_4$ is a new strong but unusual itinerant electron ferromagnet, which deserves further study as a pyrochlore metal.</description>

      <title>Low Temperature Deposition of Functional Thin Films on Insulating Substrates: Selective Ion Acceleration using Synchronized Floating Potential HiPIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionized physical vapor deposition techniques, such as high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) are gaining popularity due to their ability to produce high-quality thin films at low deposition temperatures. In those techniques, ions are commonly accelerated onto the growing film using negative potential applied to the substrate. One key challenge however is, how such potentials can be applied on insulating or electrically floating substrates. In this work, we present a novel approach for low-temperature deposition of high-quality thin films on insulating substrates using Synchronized Floating Potential High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (SFP-HiPIMS). This technique leverages the negative floating potential, induced on the substrate during the HiPIMS discharge. By synchronizing the ion arrival with the substrate's floating potential, specific ions can be accelerated preferentially, thereby enhancing adatom mobility and improving film quality while mitigating the detrimental effects of Ar+ ion bombardment. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the deposition of high-quality, textured Al0.8Sc0.2N thin films on various insulating substrates at low temperatures. We show that synchronizing the Al and Sc ion fluxes with the induced negative floating potential significantly enhances the films' crystallinity, c-axis texture and at the same time reduces residual stress. In addition, it enables epitaxial growth on sapphire at temperatures as low as 100{\deg}C. The results of this study demonstrate that SFP-HiPIMS provides a practical and economical solution for a long-standing challenge in physical vapor deposition, which can be implemented in standard deposition equipment. SFP-HiPIMS therefore paves the way for advanced manufacturing processes in various emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Layer-Spintronics in Altermagnetic Bilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current is highly desirable yet tremendously challenging in developing ultracompact spintronic device technology. Here we propose a scheme to realize the all-electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current in an altermagnetic bilayer. Such a bilayer system can host layer-spin locking, in which one layer hosts a spin-polarized current while the other layer hosts a current with opposite spin polarization. An out-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a gate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed upon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange interaction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the spin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via the layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin polarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature. This work presents the pioneering concept of layer-spintronics which synergizes altermagnetism and bilayer stacking to achieve efficient electrical control of spin.</description>

Abstract: Materials with antiferromagnetic order have recently emerged as promising candidates in spintronics based on their beneficial characteristics such as vanishing stray fields and ultra-fast dynamics. At the same time more complex localized non-coplanar magnetic states as for instance skyrmions are in the focus of applications due to their intriguing properties such as the topological Hall effect. Recently a conceptual shift has occurred to envision the use of such magnetic defects not only in one-dimensional race track devices but to exploit their unique properties in two-dimensional networks. Here we use local strain in a collinear antiferromagnet to induce non-coplanar domain wall junctions, which connect in a very specific way to form extended networks. We combine spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy with density functional theory to characterize the different building blocks of the network, and unravel the origin of the handedness of triple-junctions and the size of the arising topological orbital moments.</description>

      <title>Stable CoO$_2$ Nanoscrolls With Outstanding Electrical Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered CoO$_2$ is of great interest for its promising properties but is meta-stable in its bulk form. CoO$_2$ was synthesized by converting the quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure of bulk Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ via a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting nanostructures were predominantly nanoscrolls with very thin walls, which exhibit long-term stability. A detailed structural investigation reveals that the CoO$_2$ is found to crystallize in monoclinic form, similar to the related CaCoO$_2$-CoO$_2$ misfit structure. Individual nanoscrolls are characterized electrically and show a p-type semiconducting nature with a high current-carrying capacity of 4$\cdot$10$^5$ A cm$^{-2}$ and an extremely high breakdown voltage of up to 270 kV/cm. The results demonstrate the possibility to stabilize meta-stable materials in low-dimensional forms and a promising application of the nanoscrolls as interconnect in high-voltage electronic circuitry.</description>

      <title>Effect of the depolarizing field on the domain structure of an improper ferroelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, contrary to common belief, the depolarizing electric field generated by bound charges at thin-film surfaces can have a substantial impact on the domain structure of an improper ferroelectric with topological defects. In hexagonal-manganite thin films, we observe in phase-field simulations that through the action of the depolarizing field, (i) the average magnitude of the polarization decreases, (ii) the local magnitude of the polarization decreases with increasing distance from the domain walls, and (iii) there is a significant alteration of the domain-size distribution and average domain size, which is visualized with the pair-correlation function. We conclude that, in general, it is not appropriate to ignore the effects of the depolarizing field for thin film ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy of L1$_0$ FeNi (001), (010), and (111) ultrathin films: A first-principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous experiments, thin films of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi with different surfaces, including (001), (110) and (111), were produced and studied. Each surface defines a different alignment of the crystallographic tetragonal axis with respect to the film's plane, resulting in different magnetic anisotropies. In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to examine three series of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with surfaces (001), (010), and (111), and with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm (from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers). Our results show that films (001) have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, while (010) favor in-plane magnetization, with a clear preference for the tetragonal axis [001]. We propose calling this type of in-plane anisotropy fixed in plane. A film with surface (111) and a thickness of four atomic monolayers has the magnetization easy axis almost perpendicular to the plane of the film. As the thickness of the (111) film increases, the direction of magnetization rotates towards a tetragonal axis [001], positioned at an angle of about 45$^{o}$ to the plane of the film. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of ultrathin films increases by a maximum of 5%, and the most significant changes in spin and orbital magnetic moments occur at a depth of about three near-surface atomic monolayers. The presented results could be useful for experimental efforts to synthesize ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with different surfaces. Ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with varying magnetic anisotropies may find applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal switches, which electrically turn heat flow on and off, have attracted attention as thermal management devices. Electrochemical reduction/oxidation switches the thermal conductivity (\k{appa}\) of active metal oxide films. The performance of the previously proposed electrochemical thermal switches is low; on/off \k{appa}\-ratio is mostly less than 5 and \k{appa}\-switching width is less than 5 W/mK. We used CeO2 thin film as the active layer deposited on a solid electrolyte YSZ substrate. When the CeO2 thin film was reduced once (off-state) and then oxidized (on-state), \k{appa}\ was about 2.2 W/mK in the most reduced state, and \k{appa}\ increased with oxidation to 12.5 W/mK (on-state). This reduction (off-state)/oxidation (on-state) cycle was repeated 100 times and the average value of \k{appa}\ was 2.2 W/mK after reduction (off-state) and 12.5 W/mK after oxidation (on-state). The on/off \k{appa}\-ratio was 5.8 and \k{appa}\-switching width was 10.3 W/mK. The CeO2-based solid-state electrochemical thermal switches would be potential devices for thermal shutters and thermal displays.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials have been an exciting area of research ever since scientists first isolated a single layer of graphene. Single layer magnetic materials can provide a pathway for vdW heterostructures with magnetic properties. While most of the magnetic vdW materials exhibit ordering transitions in the bulk, here we report a successful exfoliation of a triangular lattice S=1 antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$, which already demonstrates exotic magnetism in the bulk material. We establish the number of layers of the material by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and detail a careful characterization using Raman and optical spectroscopy to demonstrate how the optical, electronic, and structural properties of NiGa$_2$S$_4$ change as a function of sample thickness. Optical measurements and electronic structure calculations of bulk versus monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$ confirm the material to be a Mott insulator with an electronic gap of about 1.5 eV, which slightly increases for layers below 10 L. We conclude with a theoretical analysis of the possibility of doping monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$ by proximity to a metal.</description>

      <title>Magneto-electric decoupling in bismuth ferrite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is still under intensive discussion, how magnetoelectric coupling actually occurs at the atomic scale in multiferroic BiFeO3. Nuclear solid-state techniques monitor local fields at the atomic scale. Using such an approach, we show that, contrary to our own expectation, ferroelectric and magnetic ordering in bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3 or BFO) decouple at the unit-cell level. Time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) data at temperatures below, close, and above the magnetic N\'eel temperature show that the coupling of the ferroelectric order to magnetization is completely absent at the bismuth site. It is common understanding that the antiferromagnetic order and the cycloidal ordering due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generate a net zero magnetization of the sample cancelling any magnetoelectric effect at the macroscopic level. Our previous data show that a very large coupling of magnetic moment and electrical distortions arises on the magnetic sub-lattice (Fe-site). The oxygen octahedra around the iron site experience a large tilt due to the onset of magnetic ordering. Nevertheless, the Bi-containing complementary sub-lattice carrying the ferroelectric order is practically unaffected by this large structural change in its direct vicinity. The magnetoelectric coupling thus vanishes already at the unit cell level. These experimental results agree well with an ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</description>

      <title>Sliding-Reversible Bandgap Modulation in Irreversible Asymmetric Multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic bandgap of a material is often fixed after fabrication. The capability to realize on-demand and non-volatile control over the bandgap will unlock exciting opportunities for adaptive devices with enhanced functionalities and efficiency. We introduce a general design principle for on-demand and non-volatile control of bandgap values, which utilizes reversible sliding-induced polarization driven by an external electric field to modulate the irreversible background polarization in asymmetric two-dimensional (2D) multilayers. The structural asymmetry can be conveniently achieved in homobilayers of Janus monolayers and heterobilayers of nonpolar monolayers, making the design principle applicable to a broad range of 2D materials. We demonstrate the versatility of this design principle using experimentally synthesized Janus metal dichalcogenide (TMD) multilayers as examples. Our first-principles calculations show that the bandgap modulation can reach up to 0.3 eV and even support a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition. By integrating a ferroelectric monolayer represented by 1T$'''$-MoS$_2$ into a bilayer, we show that the combination of intrinsic ferroelectricity and sliding ferroelectricity leads to multi-bandgap systems coupled to multi-step polarization switching. The sliding-reversible bandgap modulation offers an avenue to dynamically adjust the optical, thermal, and electronic properties of 2D materials through mechanical and electrical stimuli.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature conditions. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as function of temperature with applied magnet are performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature Tc 116 K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed that the superconducting coherent length ~40 angstroms based on Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in periodic table.</description>

      <title>Generally applicable physics-based equation of state for liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-based first-principles pressure-volume-temperature equations of state (EOS) exist for solids and gases but not for liquids due to the long-standing fundamental problems involved in liquid theory. Current EOS models that are applicable to liquids and supercritical fluids at liquid-like density under conditions relevant to planetary interiors and industrial processes are complex empirical models with many physically meaningless adjustable parameters. Here, we develop a generally applicable physics-based (GAP) EOS for liquids including supercritical fluids at liquid-like density. The GAP equation is explicit in the internal energy, and hence links the most fundamental macroscopic static property of fluids, the pressure-volume-temperature EOS, to their key microscopic property: the molecular hopping frequency or liquid relaxation time, from which the internal energy can be obtained. We test our GAP equation against available experimental data in several different ways and find good agreement. Our GAP equation, unavoidably and similarly to solid EOS, contains a semi-empirical term giving the energy of the static sample as a function of volume only (E_ST(V)). Our testing includes studies along isochores, in order to examine the validity of the GAP equation independently of the validity of any function we may choose to utilize for E_ST(V). The only other adjustable parameter in the equation is the Gruneisen parameter for the fluid. We observe that the GAP equation is similar to the Mie-Gruneisen solid EOS in a wide range of the liquid phase diagram. This similarity is ultimately related to the condensed state of these two phases. On the other hand, the differences between the GAP equation and EOS for gases are fundamental. Finally, we identify the key gaps in the experimental data that need to be filled in to proceed further with the liquid EOS.</description>

Abstract: The precise control of complex reactions is critical for biological processes yet our inability to design for specific outcomes limits the development of synthetic analogues. Here, we leverage differentiable simulators to design nontrivial reaction pathways in colloidal assemblies. By optimizing over external structures, we achieve controlled disassembly and particle release from colloidal shells. Lastly, we characterize the role of configurational entropy in the structure via both forward calculations and optimization, inspiring new parameterizations of designed colloidal reactions.</description>

      <title>Irregular Bloch Zener oscillations in two-dimensional flat-band Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a static electrical field is applied to a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac material, Landau-Zener transition (LZT) and Bloch-Zener oscillations can occur. Employing alpha-T3 lattices as a paradigm for a broad class of 2D Dirac materials, we uncover two phenomena. First, due to the arbitrarily small energy gaps near a Dirac point that make it more likely for LZTs to occur than in other regions of the Brillouin zone, the distribution of differential LZT probability in the momentum space can form a complicated morphological pattern. Second, a change in the LZT morphology as induced by a mutual switching of the two distinct Dirac points can lead to irregular Bloch-Zener oscillations characterized by a non-smooth behavior in the time evolution of the electrical current density associated with the oscillation. These phenomena are due to mixed interference of quantum states in multiple bands modulated by the geometric and dynamic phases. We demonstrate that the adiabatic-impulse model describing Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferometry can be exploited to calculate the phases, due to the equivalence between the alpha-T3 lattice subject to a constant electrical field and strongly periodically driven two- or three-level systems. The degree of irregularity of Bloch-Zener oscillations can be harnessed by selecting the morphology pattern, which is potentially experimentally realizable.</description>

      <title>An experimental scheme for determining the Berry phase in two-dimensional quantum materials with a flat band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimentally feasible methods to determine the Berry phase, a fundamental quantity characterizing a quantum material, are often needed in applications. We develop an approach to detecting the Berry phase by using a class of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials with a flat band, the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattices. The properties of this class of quantum materials are controlled by a single parameter $0 \le \alpha \le 1$, where the left and right endpoints correspond to graphene with pseudospin-1/2 and the dice lattice with pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl quasiparticles, respectively, and each specific value of $\alpha$ represents a material with a unique Berry phase. Applying a constant electric field to the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice, we calculate the resulting electric current and find a one-to-one correspondence between the current and the Berry phase in both the linear and nonlinear response regimes. In the linear (Kubo) regime, the main physics is the Zitterbewegung effect. In the nonlinear regime, the Schwinger mechanism dominates. Beyond the nonlinear regime, Bloch-Zener oscillations can arise. Measuring the current thus provides an effective and experimentally feasible way to determine the Berry phase for this spectrum of 2D quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Transparent Electrodes: Interplay of High Purity SWCNTs network and a Polymer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of transparent electrodes led to the development of optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, LCDs, touchscreens, IR sensors, etc. Since ITO has many drawbacks in respect of its production cost and limited transparency in IR, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been a potential replacement for ITO due to their exceptional electrical and optical properties, especially in the IR region. In this work, we present the development of a CNT-polymer composite thin film that exhibits outstanding transparency across both visible and IR spectra prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. This approach not only ensures uniform integration and crosslinking of CNTs into lightweight matrices, but also represents a cost-effective method for producing transparent electrodes with remarkable optical and electrical properties. The produced films achieved a transparency above 80% in the UV-VIS range and approximately 70% in the mid-IR range. The sheet resistance of the fabricated thin films was measured at about 4 kOhm/sq, showing a tendency to decrease with the number of bilayers. Furthermore, in this work we have investigated electrical properties and transport mechanisms in more detail with computational analysis. Computational analysis was performed to better understand the electrical behavior of nanotube-polymer junctions in the interbundle structure. Based on all results, we propose that the transparent electrodes with 4 and 6 bilayers are the most optimal structures in terms of optical and electrical properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Processing with Molecular Nanomagnets: an introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many problems intractable on classical devices could be solved by algorithms explicitly based on quantum mechanical laws, i.e. exploiting quantum information processing. As a result, increasing efforts from different fields are nowadays directed to the actual realization of quantum devices. Here we provide an introduction to Quantum Information Processing, focusing on a promising setup for its implementation, represented by molecular spin clusters known as Molecular Nanomagnets. We introduce the basic tools to understand and design quantum algorithms, always referring to their actual realization on a molecular spin architecture. We then examine the most important sources of noise in this class of systems and then one of their most peculiar features, i.e. the possibility to exploit many (more than two) available states to encode information and to self-correct it from errors via proper design of quantum error correction codes. Finally, we present some examples of quantum algorithms proposed and implemented on a molecular spin qudit hardware.</description>

      <title>Rapid Polymorphic Screening using Sessile Microdroplets: Competitive Nucleation of Mannitol Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a rapid polymorphic screening approach based on contracting sessile microdroplets which offers several advantages: (1) achieves very high supersaturation to facilitate formation of metastable forms (2) allows systematic labeling of samples (3) gives access to statistical distribution of polymorphic selectivity as a function of experimental conditions (4) ensures the formation of crystal for each droplet, addressing the problem of uncrystallized droplets in traditional microfluidics. We studied the competitive nucleation of D-mannitol polymorphs and investigated the effect of droplet volume on polymorphic selectivity. We showed that our observed polymorph distributions at different volumes are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of classical nucleation theory except for very small volumes where thermodynamic confinement or surface effects could play a substantial role. Overall, our microfluidic approach can be a promising tool not only for routine screening of pharmaceutical polymorphs in the industrial context but also in the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying the competitive nucleation of polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Molecular Property Prediction: A Survey of Single and Multimodal Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Property Prediction (MPP) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, spanning drug discovery, material science, and environmental chemistry. Fueled by the exponential growth of chemical data and the evolution of artificial intelligence, recent years have witnessed remarkable strides in MPP. However, the multifaceted nature of molecular data, such as molecular structures, SMILES notation, and molecular images, continues to pose a fundamental challenge in its effective representation. To address this, representation learning techniques are instrumental as they acquire informative and interpretable representations of molecular data. This article explores recent AI/-based approaches in MPP, focusing on both single and multiple modality representation techniques. It provides an overview of various molecule representations and encoding schemes, categorizes MPP methods by their use of modalities, and outlines datasets and tools available for feature generation. The article also analyzes the performance of recent methods and suggests future research directions to advance the field of MPP.</description>
