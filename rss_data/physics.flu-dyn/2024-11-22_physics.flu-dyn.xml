      <title>FLRNet: A Deep Learning Method for Regressive Reconstruction of Flow Field From Limited Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications in computational and experimental fluid mechanics require effective methods for reconstructing the flow fields from limited sensor data. However, this task remains a significant challenge because the measurement operator, which provides the punctual sensor measurement for a given state of the flow field, is often ill-conditioned and non-invertible. This issue impedes the feasibility of identifying the forward map, theoretically the inverse of the measurement operator, for field reconstruction purposes. While data-driven methods are available, their generalizability across different flow conditions (\textit{e.g.,} different Reynold numbers) remains questioned. Moreover, they frequently face the problem of spectral bias, which leads to smooth and blurry reconstructed fields, thereby decreasing the accuracy of reconstruction. We introduce FLRNet, a deep learning method for flow field reconstruction from sparse sensor measurements. FLRNet employs an variational autoencoder with Fourier feature layers and incorporates an extra perceptual loss term during training to learn a rich, low-dimensional latent representation of the flow field. The learned latent representation is then correlated to the sensor measurement using a fully connected (dense) network. We validated the reconstruction capability and the generalizability of FLRNet under various fluid flow conditions and sensor configurations, including different sensor counts and sensor layouts. Numerical experiments show that in all tested scenarios, FLRNet consistently outperformed other baselines, delivering the most accurate reconstructed flow field and being the most robust to noise.</description>

      <title>Simulating squirmers with smoothed particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microswimmers play an important role in shaping the world around us. The squirmer is a simple model for microswimmer whose cilia oscillations on its spherical surface induce an effective slip velocity to propel itself. The rapid development of computational fluid dynamics methods has markedly enhanced our capacity to study the behavior of squirmers in aqueous environments. Nevertheless, a unified methodology that can fully address the complexity of fluid-solid coupling at multiple scales and interface tracking for multiphase flows remains elusive, posing an outstanding challenge to the field. To this end, we investigate the potential of the smoothed particle dynamics (SPD) method as an alternative approach for simulating squirmers. The Lagrangian nature of the method allows it to effectively address the aforementioned difficulty. By introducing a novel treatment of the boundary condition and assigning appropriate slip velocities to the boundary particles, the SPD-squirmer model is able to accurately represent a range of microswimmer types including pushers, neutral swimmers, and pullers. We systematically validate the steady-state velocity of the squirmer, the resulting flow field, its hydrodynamic interactions with the surrounding environment, and the mutual collision of two squirmers. In the presence of Brownian motion, the model is also able to correctly calculate the velocity and angular velocity autocorrelation functions at the mesoscale. Finally, we simulate a squirmer within a multiphase flow by considering a droplet that encloses a squirmer and imposing a surface tension between the two flow phases. We find that the squirmer within the droplet exhibits different motion types.</description>

      <title>The efficient implementation of transport velocity formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method suffers from tensile instability, resulting in particle clumping and void regions under negative pressure conditions. In this study, we extend the transport-velocity formulation of Adami et al. (2013) \cite{adami2013transport} in the weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) framework to address this long-standing issue. Rather than relying on background pressure, our modified and improved transport-velocity correction scales directly to the smoothing length, making it suitable for variable-resolution flows. Additionally, we introduce a limiter to the new formulation to prevent overcorrection, especially for flow with small velocities. These modifications enhance the general applicability of the transport velocity in fluid dynamics. Numerical tests involving low-velocity and variable-resolution cases demonstrate that the new formulation offers a general and accurate solution for multi-physics SPH simulations.</description>

      <title>Equivalent slip length of flow around a super-hydrophobic cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, a two-dimensional numerical simulation is conducted to determine the equivalent wall slip length for flow around a circular cylinder featuring a super-hydrophobic surface. The super-hydrophobic surface is modeled as an alternating distribution of slip and no-slip conditions along the cylinder's surface. The smallest unit of this alternating pattern is referred to as a monomer. The study takes into account the Reynolds number and two critical dimensionless parameters: the gas fraction (GF) and the ratio l/a. GF indicates the proportion of the slip length relative to the total length of the monomer, while l/a denotes the ratio of the monomer length (l) to the cylinder's radius (a). The ranges considered for the Reynolds number, GF, and l/a are from 0.2 to 180, 0.1 to 0.99, and $\pi$/80 to $\pi$/5, respectively. A dimensionless number, the Knudsen number (Kn), is introduced to measure the ratio between the equivalent slip length ($\lambda$) and the cylinder's diameter (D). By equating the integral wall friction resistance on the cylinder surface, a quantitative relationship between the equivalent Kn and the parameters (Re, GF, l/a) is established. A meticulous comparison of flow parameters between the equivalent slip length model and the slip-no-slip scenario reveals that the slip length model is an effective approximation for the slip-no-slip alternating model.</description>

      <title>From underground natural gas to hydrogen storage in fractured reservoir rock : comparing relative permeabilities for hydrogen versus methane and nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage in saline aquifers is a potential solution for seasonal renewable energy storage. Among potential storage sites, facilities used for underground natural gas storage have advantages, including well-characterized cyclical injection-withdrawal behavior and partially reusable infrastructure. However, the differences between hydrogen-brine and natural gas-brine flow, particularly through fractures in the reservoir and the sealing caprock, remain unclear due to the complexity of two-phase flow. Therefore, we investigate fracture relative permeability for hydrogen versus methane (natural gas) and nitrogen (commonly used in laboratories). Steady-state relative permeability experiments were conducted at 10 MPa on fractured carbonate rock from the Loenhout natural gas storage in Belgium, where gas flows through {\textmu}m-to-mm scale fractures. Our results reveal that the hydrogen exhibits similar relative permeability curves to methane, but both are significantly lower than those measured for nitrogen. This implies that nitrogen cannot reliably serve as a proxy for hydrogen at typical reservoir pressures. The low relative permeabilities for hydrogen and methane indicate strong fluid phase interference, which traditional relative permeability models fail to capture. This is supported by our observation of periodic pressure fluctuations associated with intermittent fluid connectivity for hydrogen and methane. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the fundamental flow properties of fractured rocks are complex but relatively similar for hydrogen and natural gas. This is an important insight for predictive modeling of the conversion of Loenhout and similar natural gas storage facilities, which is crucial to evaluate their hydrogen storage efficiency and integrity.</description>

      <title>Learning Pore-scale Multi-phase Flow from Experimental Data with Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the process of multiphase fluid flow through porous media is crucial for many climate change mitigation technologies, including CO$_2$ geological storage, hydrogen storage, and fuel cells. However, current numerical models are often incapable of accurately capturing the complex pore-scale physics observed in experiments. In this study, we address this challenge using a graph neural network-based approach and directly learn pore-scale fluid flow using micro-CT experimental data. We propose a Long-Short-Edge MeshGraphNet (LSE-MGN) that predicts the state of each node in the pore space at each time step. During inference, given an initial state, the model can autoregressively predict the evolution of the multiphase flow process over time. This approach successfully captures the physics from the high-resolution experimental data while maintaining computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for accurate and efficient pore-scale modeling of complex multiphase fluid flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Direct Numerical Simulations of K-type transition in a flat-plate boundary layer with supercritical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the controlled K-type breakdown of a flat-plate boundary-layer with highly non-ideal supercritical fluid at a reduced pressure of $p_{r,\infty}=1.10$. Direct numerical simulations are performed at a Mach number of $M_\infty=0.2$ for one subcritical (liquid-like regime) temperature profile and one strongly-stratified transcritical (pseudo-boiling) temperature profile with slightly heated wall. In the subcritical case, the formation of aligned $\Lambda$-vortices is delayed compared to the reference ideal-gas case of Sayadi et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 724, 2013, pp. 480-509), with steady longitudinal modes dominating the late-transitional stage. When the wall temperature exceeds the pseudo-boiling temperature, streak secondary instabilities lead to the simultaneous development of additional hairpin vortices and near-wall streaky structures near the legs of the primary aligned $\Lambda$-vortices. Nonetheless, transition to turbulence is not violent and is significantly delayed compared to the subcritical regime.</description>

      <title>CoNFiLD-inlet: Synthetic Turbulence Inflow Using Generative Latent Diffusion Models with Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eddy-resolving turbulence simulations require stochastic inflow conditions that accurately replicate the complex, multi-scale structures of turbulence. Traditional recycling-based methods rely on computationally expensive precursor simulations, while existing synthetic inflow generators often fail to reproduce realistic coherent structures of turbulence. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have opened new possibilities for inflow turbulence generation, yet many DL-based methods rely on deterministic, autoregressive frameworks prone to error accumulation, resulting in poor robustness for long-term predictions. In this work, we present CoNFiLD-inlet, a novel DL-based inflow turbulence generator that integrates diffusion models with a conditional neural field (CNF)-encoded latent space to produce realistic, stochastic inflow turbulence. By parameterizing inflow conditions using Reynolds numbers, CoNFiLD-inlet generalizes effectively across a wide range of Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau$ between $10^3$ and $10^4$) without requiring retraining or parameter tuning. Comprehensive validation through a priori and a posteriori tests in Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES) demonstrates its high fidelity, robustness, and scalability, positioning it as an efficient and versatile solution for inflow turbulence synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally stable symplectic integrators for the Navier-Stokes equations and other dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators offer vastly superior performance over traditional numerical techniques for conservative dynamical systems, but their application to \emph{dissipative} systems is inherently difficult due to dissipative systems' lack of symplectic structure. Leveraging the intrinsic variational structure of higher-order dynamics, this paper presents a general technique for applying existing symplectic integration schemes to dissipative systems, with particular emphasis on viscous fluids modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. Two very simple such schemes are developed here. Not only are these schemes unconditionally stable for dissipative systems, they also outperform traditional methods with a similar degree of complexity in terms of accuracy for a given time step. For example, in the case of viscous flow between two infinite, flat plates, one of the schemes developed here is found to outperform both the implicit Euler method and the explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method in predicting the velocity profile. To the authors' knowledge, this is the very first time that a symplectic integration scheme has been applied successfully to the Navier-Stokes equations. We interpret the present success as direct empirical validation of the canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the Navier-Stokes problem recently published by Sanders~\emph{et al.} More sophisticated symplectic integration schemes are expected to exhibit even greater performance. It is hoped that these results will lead to improved numerical methods in computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Mapping Method with Source Terms: Applications to Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a generalized characteristic mapping method designed to handle non-linear advection with source terms. The semi-Lagrangian approach advances the flow map, incorporating the source term via the Duhamel integral. We derive a recursive formula for the time decomposition of the map and the source term integral, enhancing computational efficiency. Benchmark computations are presented for a test case with an exact solution and for two-dimensional ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Results demonstrate third-order accuracy in both space and time. The submap decomposition method achieves exceptionally high resolution, as illustrated by zooming into fine-scale current sheets. An error estimate is performed and suggests third order convergence in space and time.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of Regularity, Bifurcations, and Turbulence in Fluid Dynamics via Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for the study of regularity, bifurcations, and turbulence in fluid dynamics, leveraging the power of Sobolev and Besov function spaces. We delve into the detailed definitions, properties, and notations of these spaces, illustrating their relevance in the context of partial differential equations governing fluid flow. The work emphasizes the intricate connections between Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, highlighting their interplay in the analysis of fluid systems. We propose new regularity criteria for solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, based on the interaction of low and high-frequency modes in turbulent regimes. These criteria offer a novel perspective on the conditions under which singularities may form, providing critical insights into the structure of turbulent flows. The article further explores the applications of these function spaces to the analysis of bifurcations in fluid systems, offering a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that lead to complex flow phenomena such as turbulence. Through the development of rigorous theorems and proofs, the paper aims to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theory and practical fluid dynamics. In particular, the results contribute to ongoing efforts in solving the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem, a key challenge in the field, and have potential implications for the Millennium Prize Problem. The conclusion underscores the significance of these findings, offering a pathway for future research in the analysis of fluid behavior at both small and large scales.</description>

      <title>Variational Multiscale Evolve and Filter Strategies for Convection-Dominated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolve-filter (EF) model is a filter-based numerical stabilization for under-resolved convection-dominated flows. EF is a simple, modular, and effective strategy for both full-order models (FOMs) and reduced-order models (ROMs). It is well-known, however, that when the filter radius is too large, EF can be overdiffusive and yield inaccurate results. To alleviate this, EF is usually supplemented with a relaxation step. The relaxation parameter, however, is very sensitive with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to alleviate the EF overdiffusivity for a large filter radius. Specifically, we leverage the variational multiscale (VMS) framework to separate the large resolved scales from the small resolved scales in the evolved velocity, and we use the filtered small scales to correct the large scales. Furthermore, in the new VMS-EF strategy, we use two different ways to decompose the evolved velocity: the VMS Evolve-Filter-Filter-Correct (VMS-EFFC) and the VMS Evolve-Postprocess-Filter-Correct (VMS-EPFC) algorithms. The new VMS-based algorithms yield significantly more accurate results than the standard EF in both the FOM and the ROM simulations of a flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 1000.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Supersonic Jet and Shock Wave with High-Resolution Quantitative Schlieren Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced optical configuration for a single-pass quantitative Schlieren imaging system that achieves an optical resolution of approximately 4.6 micrometers. The modified setup decouples sensitivity from resolution, enabling independent optimization of these critical parameters. Using this high-resolution system, we conduct quantitative analyses of supersonic jets emitted from sub-millimeter nozzles into the atmosphere and investigate shock waves induced by knife blades interacting with these jets in a vacuum environment. The fine resolution allows for detailed visualization of shock wave structures and accurate measurement of density gradients. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness by examining the density gradient profile along the shock diamonds and mapping density profiles across shock waves. These density profiles are analyzed for their relevance in laser-plasma applications, including laser wakefield acceleration and the Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Laser (AnaBHEL) experiment. Our findings indicate that this system can help determine key parameters such as peak density, plateau length, and shock wave thickness-essential for optimizing electron acceleration and achieving specific plasma density profiles. This high-resolution quantitative Schlieren imaging technique thus serves as a valuable tool for exploring complex fluid dynamics and supporting advancements in laser-plasma physics research.</description>

Abstract: For reasons of computational constraint, most global ocean circulation models used for Earth System Modeling still rely on parameterizations of sub-grid processes, and limitations in these parameterizations affect the modeled ocean circulation and impact on predictive skill. An increasingly popular approach is to leverage machine learning approaches for parameterizations, regressing for a map between the resolved state and missing feedbacks in a fluid system as a supervised learning task. However, the learning is often performed in an `offline' fashion, without involving the underlying fluid dynamical model during the training stage. Here, we explore the `online' approach that involves the fluid dynamical model during the training stage for the learning of baroclinic turbulence and its parameterization, with reference to ocean eddy parameterization. Two online approaches are considered: a full adjoint-based online approach, related to traditional adjoint optimization approaches that require a `differentiable' dynamical model, and an approximately online approach that approximates the adjoint calculation and does not require a differentiable dynamical model. The online approaches are found to be generally more skillful and numerically stable than offline approaches. Others details relating to online training, such as window size, machine learning model set up and designs of the loss functions are detailed to aid in further explorations of the online training methodology for Earth System Modeling.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow channeling and mass transport with discontinuous porosity distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types routinely have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions. The space-time method enables a straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results show the influence of different kinds of layering in the development of fluid-rich channels and mass transport.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Readout Problem in Quantum Differential Equation Algorithms with Quantum Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum differential equation solvers aim to prepare solutions as $n$-qubit quantum states over a fine grid of $O(2^n)$ points, surpassing the linear scaling of classical solvers. However, unlike classically stored vectors of solutions, the readout of exact quantum states poses a bottleneck due to the complexity of tomography. Here, we show that the readout problem can be addressed with quantum learning tools where we focus on distilling the relevant features. Treating outputs of quantum differential equation solvers as quantum data, we demonstrate that low-dimensional output can be extracted using a measurement operator adapted to detect relevant features. We apply this quantum scientific machine learning approach to classify solutions for shock wave detection and turbulence modeling in scenarios where data samples come directly from quantum differential equation solvers. We show that the basis chosen for performing analysis greatly impacts classification accuracy. Our work opens up the area of research where quantum machine learning for quantum datasets is inherently required.</description>

      <title>Introducing a Harmonic Balance Navier-Stokes Finite Element Solver to Accelerate Cardiovascular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of cardiovascular simulations for diagnosis and surgical planning on a patient-specific basis requires the development of faster methods than the existing state-of-the-art techniques. To address this need, we leverage the periodic nature of these flows to accurately capture their time-dependence using spectral discretization. Owing to the reduced size of the discrete problem, the resulting approach, known as the harmonic balance method, significantly lowers the solution cost when compared against the conventional time marching methods. This study describes a stabilized finite element implementation of the harmonic balanced method that targets the simulation of physically-stable time-periodic flows. That stabilized method is based on the Galerkin/least-squares formulation that permits stable solution in convection-dominant flows and convenient use of the same interpolation functions for velocity and pressure. We test this solver against its equivalent time marching method using three common physiological cases where blood flow is modeled in a Glenn operation, a cerebral artery, and a left main coronary artery. Using the conventional time marching solver, simulating these cases takes more than ten hours. That cost is reduced by up to two orders of magnitude when the proposed harmonic balance solver is utilized, where a solution is produced in approximately 30 minutes. We show that that solution is in excellent agreement with the conventional solvers when the number of modes is sufficiently large to accurately represent the imposed boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: Building on previous results on the quadratic helicity in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) we investigate particular minimum helicity states. Those are eigenfunctions of the curl operator and are shown to constitute solutions of the quasi-stationary incompressible ideal MHD equations. We then show that these states have indeed minimum quadratic helicity.</description>

      <title>Inverse non-linear problem of the long wave run-up on coast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the process of catastrophic tsunami-type waves on the coast makes it possible to determine the destructive force of waves on the coast. In hydrodynamics, the one-dimensional theory of the run-up of non-linear waves on a flat slope has gained great popularity, within which rigorous analytical results have been obtained in the class of non-breaking waves. In general, the result depends on the characteristics of the wave approaching (or generated on) the slope, which is usually not known in the measurements. Here we describe a rigorous method for recovering the initial displacement in a source localised in an inclined power-shaped channel from the characteristics of a moving shoreline. The method uses the generalised Carrier-Greenspan transformation, which allows one-dimensional non-linear shallow-water equations to be reduced to linear ones. The solution is found in terms of Erd\'elyi-Kober integral operator. Numerical verification of our results is presented for the cases of a parabolic bay and an infinite plane beach.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Element Enrichment Wall-Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an enrichment wall-model within the spectral element method (SEM) framework for large-eddy simulations of wall-bounded flows. The method augments the polynomial solution in the wall-adjacent elements with an analytical law-of-the-wall enrichment function representing the mean velocity near the wall. In the solution representation, this enrichment function captures the large gradients in the boundary layer, which allows the polynomial modes to represent the turbulent fluctuations. The enriched solution is able to resolve the shear stress at the wall without any modification to the no-slip wall boundary conditions. The performance of the SEM enrichment wall-modeling approach is assessed in turbulent channel flow LES for a range of Reynolds numbers. The results show that the proposed method improves solution accuracy on under-resolved near-wall grids as compared to the traditional shear stress wall-models.</description>

      <title>Reduced Representations of Rayleigh-B\'enard Flows via Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed the performance of Convolutional Autoencoders in generating reduced-order representations the temperature field of 2D Rayleigh-B\'enard flows at $Pr=1$ and Rayleigh numbers extending from $10^6$ to $10^8$, capturing the range where the flow transitions to turbulence. We present a way of estimating the minimum number of dimensions needed by the Autoencoders to capture all the relevant physical scales of the data that is more apt for highly multiscale flows than previous criteria applied to lower dimensional systems. We compare our architecture with two regularized variants as well as with linear methods, and find that manually fixing the dimension of the latent space produces the best results. We show how the estimated minimum dimension presents a sharp increase around $Ra \sim 10^7$, when the flow starts to transition to turbulence. Furthermore, we show how this dimension does not follow the same scaling as the physically relevant scales, such as the dissipation lengthscale and the thermal boundary layer.</description>

      <title>The initial acceleration of a buoyant spherical bubble revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical derivation of the buoyancy-induced initial acceleration of a spherical gas bubble in a host liquid is presented. The theory makes no assumptions further than applying the two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, showing that neither the classical approach using potential theory nor other simplifying assumptions are needed. The result for the initial bubble acceleration as a function of the gas and liquid densities, classically built on potential theory, is retained. The result is reproduced by detailed numerical simulations. The accelerated, although stagnant state of the bubble induces a pressure distribution on the bubble surface which is different from the result related to the Archimedean principle, emphasizing the importance of the non-equilibrium state for the force acting on the bubble.</description>

      <title>A TVD neural network closure and application to turbulent combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) have attractive features for closing governing equations. There are many methods that are showing promise, but all can fail in cases when small errors consequentially violate physical reality, such as a solution boundedness condition. A NN formulation is introduced to preclude spurious oscillations that violate solution boundedness or positivity. It is embedded in the discretized equations as a machine learning closure and strictly constrained, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. The constraint is exactly enforced during gradient-descent training by rescaling the NN parameters, which maps them onto an explicit feasible set. Demonstrations show that the constrained NN closure model usefully recovers linear and nonlinear hyperbolic phenomena and anti-diffusion while enforcing the non-oscillatory property. Finally, the model is applied to subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of a turbulent reacting flow, for which it suppresses spurious oscillations in scalar fields that otherwise violate the solution boundedness. It outperforms a simple penalization of oscillations in the loss function.</description>
