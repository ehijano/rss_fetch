      <title>How to explain the sensitivity of DNA double-strand breaks yield to 125I position?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Auger emitters exhibit interesting features due to their emission of a cascade of short-range Auger electrons. Maximum DNA breakage efficacy is achieved when decays occur near DNA. Studies of double-strand breaks (DSBs) yields in plasmids revealed cutoff distances from DNA axis of 10.5-12 {\AA}, beyond which the mechanism of DSBs moves from direct to indirect effects, and the yield decreases rapidly. Some authors suggested that the average energy deposited in a DNA cylinder could explain such cutoffs. We aimed to study this hypothesis in further detail.Materials and methods: Using the Monte Carlo code CELLDOSE, we investigated the influence of the 125I atom position on energy deposits and absorbed doses per decay not only in a DNA cylinder, but also in individual strands, each modeled as 10 spheres encompassing the fragility sites for phosphodiester bond cleavage.Results: The dose per decay decreased much more rapidly for a sphere in the proximal strand than for the DNA cylinder. For example, when moving the 125I source from 10.5 {\AA} to 11.5 {\AA}, the average dose to the sphere dropped by 43%, compared to only 13% in the case of the cylinder.Conclusions: Explaining variations in DSBs yields with 125I position should consider the probability of inducing damage in the proximal strand (nearest to the 125I atom). The energy received by fragility sites in this strand is highly influenced by the isotropic (4$\pi$) emission of 125I low-energy Auger electrons. The positioning of Auger emitters for targeted radionuclide therapy can be envisioned accordingly.</description>

      <title>Simulation of depth-dose curves and water equivalent ratios of energetic proton beams in cortical bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have determined the depth-dose curve, the penetration range, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), for proton beams of clinical energies in cortical bone, by means of a detailed and accurate simulation that combines molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. The fundamental input quantities (stopping power and energy loss straggling) for the simulation were obtained from a reliable electronic excitation spectrum of the condensed-phase target, which takes into account the organic and mineral phases that form it. Our simulations with these inputs, that are in excellent agreement with the scarce data available for a cortical bone target, deviate from simulations performed using other stopping quantities, such as those provided by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) in its widely used Report 49. The results of this work emphasize the importance of an accurate determination of the stopping quantities of cortical bone in order to advance towards the millimetric precision for the proton penetration ranges and deposited dose needed in radiotherapy.</description>
