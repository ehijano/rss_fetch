      <title>Stimulated Brillouin Amplification with Flying Focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material damage thresholds pose a fundamental limit to chirped pulse amplification (CPA) in high-power laser systems. Plasma-based amplification via stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) offers a damage-free alternative, yet its effectiveness has been hindered by instabilities that constrain interaction length. In this study, we report the first experimental demonstration of SBS amplification driven by a flying focus in a 3-mm plasma channel. The flying focus is generated using chromatic aberration from spherical lenses, with its velocity precisely measured by an interferometric ionization method achieving 6.6 fs timing resolution. At a focus velocity near -c, SBS amplification is realized at pump and seed intensities more than two orders of magnitude lower than in conventional setups, yielding a conversion efficiency of 14.5%. These results validate flying focus as a powerful tool for extending interaction lengths and enabling efficient plasma-based laser amplification at reduced intensities.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and Re-excitation of Sawtooth Oscillations due to Energetic Particles in Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sawtooth oscillations, driven by internal kink modes (IKMs), are fundamental phenomena in tokamak plasmas. They can be classified into different types, including normal sawteeth, small sawteeth, and in some cases, evolving into the steady-island state, each having a different impact on energy confinement in fusion reactors. This study investigates the interaction between sawtooth oscillations and energetic particles (EPs) using the initial-value MHD-kinetic hybrid code CLT-K, which can perform long-term self-consistent nonlinear simulations. We analyze the redistribution of EPs caused by sawtooth crashes and the effect of EPs on sawtooth behavior and type transitions. The results show that co-passing EPs tend to re-excite sawtooth oscillations, extending their period, while counter-passing EPs promote the system evolution toward small sawteeth, potentially leading to the steady-island state. Additionally, we provide a physical picture of how EPs influence sawtooth type through the mechanism of magnetic flux pumping. We demonstrate that the radial residual flow in the core plays a crucial role in determining the reconnection rate and sawtooth type. Moreover, we observe new phenomena about couplings of various instabilities, such as the excitation of global multi-mode toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAEs) due to EP redistribution following a sawtooth crash and the excitation of the resonant tearing mode (r-TM) when injecting counter-passing EPs. The study also explores the impact of EP energy and the safety factor profile on the development of stochastic magnetic fields and EP transport. These findings emphasize the necessity of multi-mode simulations in capturing the complexity of EP-sawtooth interactions and provide insights for optimizing sawtooth control in future reactors such as ITER.</description>

      <title>Controlling the electric force on a dust particle during the afterglow of a plasma at a higher gas pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dust particles are immersed in a plasma, and the power that sustains a plasma is terminated, the charge of dust particles will change in the early afterglow, as electrons and ions gradually diminish in number. The possibility of controlling this charge, along with the electric force acting on the particles in the late afterglow, has earlier been demonstrated at a low gas pressure of 8 mTorr. Here, it is confirmed experimentally that controlling particles is possible also at a higher gas pressure of 90 mTorr, in a capacitively coupled radio-frequency plasma (CCP). A timed application of a DC electric field during the afterglow is a key element of this control scheme. Analyzing the experimental results, the electric force in the late afterglow was determined by comparing measurements of particle velocity to a prediction made by integrating the equation of motion, taking into account gas friction. In addition to applying friction to dust particles, gas also slows the drifting motion of electrons and ions, reducing their energy during the afterglow, but nevertheless we find that dust particles become charged in the afterglow so that one can apply an electric force to them that is comparable to the gravitational force, even at a higher pressure than had previously been demonstrated. This result extends the parameter range for which it is expected that particle contamination in semiconductor manufacturing can be mitigated by controlling charge and forces during the afterglow. Because of the way that forces scale with particle size, it is expected that submicron particles can be controlled even more easily than the larger spheres in the present experiment.</description>

      <title>Theory uncertainties in predictions of strong-field QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments using high-power lasers and relativistic electron beams will soon be capable of precision testing of the theory of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. The comparison between experiment and theory always occurs via numerical simulations, but the lack of quantitative uncertainty bounds for the latter means that the origin of any discrepancies cannot be identified conclusively. Here I present a simulation framework that can place meaningful bounds on the theory uncertainties inherent to its operation. This work shows that the use of the locally constant field approximation leads to a theory uncertainty of a few per cent in the signals of quantum radiation reaction expected in near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>Mathematical formulation of mode-to-mode energy transfers and energy fluxes in compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding compressible turbulence is critical for modeling atmospheric, astrophysical, and engineering flows. However, compressible turbulence poses a more significant challenge than incompressible turbulence. We present a novel mathematical framework to compute \textit{mode-to-mode energy transfer rates} and energy fluxes for compressible flows. The formalism captures detailed energy conservation within triads and allows decomposition of transfers into rotational, compressive, and mixed components, providing a clear picture of energy exchange among velocity and internal energy modes. We also establish analogies with incompressible hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic flows, highlighting the framework's universality in studying energy transfers.</description>

      <title>Zonal flow suppression of turbulent transport in the optimized stellarators W7-X and QSTK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of transport in two optimized stellarator configurations: Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and a recent design called Quasi-Symmetric Turbulence Konzept (QSTK). Using global Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC), we explore the role of zonal flows (ZFs) in suppressing electrostatic Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven turbulence in both configurations. The simulations reveal that ZFs significantly reduce ion heat transport in both W7-X and QSTK, with a lower value of heat flux on the latter configuration, as suggested by the apparently higher linear threshold (''critical'') gradients for ITG modes. The study also highlights that both stellarators exhibit similar mode structures. The results support the notion that linear stability measures, in combination with nonlinear stabilization by zonal flows, can play an important role in the suppression of nonlinear heat fluxes.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned trends in mirror configurations in the Large Plasma Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the efficacy of ML-based trend inference using data from the Large Plasma Device (LAPD). The LAPD is a flexible basic plasma science device with a high discharge repetition rate (0.25-1 Hz) and reproducible plasmas capable of collecting high-spatial-resolution probe measurements. A diverse dataset is collected through random sampling of LAPD operational parameters, including the magnetic field strength and profile, fueling settings, and the discharge voltage. NN ensembles with uncertainty quantification are trained to predict time-averaged ion saturation current ($I_\text{sat}$ -- proportional to density and the square root of electron temperature) at any position within the dataset domain. Model-inferred trends, such as the effects of introducing mirrors or changing the discharge voltage, are consistent with current understanding. In addition, axial variation is optimized via comprehensive search over $I_\text{sat}$ predictions. Experimental validation of these optimized machine parameters demonstrate qualitative agreement, with quantitative differences attributable to Langmuir probe variation and cathode conditions. This investigation demonstrates, using ML techniques, a new way of extracting insight from experiments and novel optimization of plasmas. The code and data used in this study are made freely available.</description>

      <title>Piecewise omnigenous stellarators with zero bootstrap current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Until now, quasi-isodynamic magnetic fields have been the only known stellarator configurations that, at low collisionality, give small radial neoclassical transport and zero bootstrap current for arbitrary plasma profiles, the latter facilitating control of the magnetic configuration. The recently introduced notion of piecewise omnigenous fields has enormously broadened the space of stellarator configurations with small radial neoclassical transport. In this Letter, the existence of piecewise omnigenous fields that give zero bootstrap current is proven analytically and confirmed numerically. These results establish piecewise omnigenity as an alternative approach to stellarator reactor design.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the collisionless tearing mode by flow shear: implications for reconnection onset in the Alfv\'enic solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet with a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing shear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic. We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth rate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio, the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that even a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling behaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear flow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the electron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection events in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker Solar Probe.</description>
