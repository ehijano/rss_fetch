      <title>Smooth solutions to the Christoffel problem in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Christoffel problem is possibly the oldest problem of prescribed curvatures for convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. Recently, this problem has been naturally formulated in the context of uniformly $h$-convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space by Espinar-G\'alvez-Mira.
  Surprisingly, Espinar-G\'alvez-Mira find that the Christoffel problem in hyperbolic space is essentially equivalent to the Nirenberg-Kazdan-Warner problem on prescribing scalar curvature on $\mathbb{S}^n$. This equivalence opens a new door to study the Nirenberg-Kazdan-Warner problem.
  In this paper, we establish a existence of solutions to the Christoffel problem in hyperbolic space by proving a full rank theorem. As a corollary, a existence of solutions to the Nirenberg-Kazdan-Warner problem follows.</description>

      <title>On the genericity of singularities in spacetimes with weakly trapped submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate suitable, physically motivated conditions on spacetimes containing certain submanifolds - the so-called {weakly trapped submanifolds} - that ensure, in a set of neighboring metrics with respect to a convenient topology, that the phenomenon of nonspacelike geodesic incompleteness (i.e., the existence of singularities) is generic in a precise technical sense. We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold $M$, in the spirit of Lerner, and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold $\Sigma$ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite ``large'' in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when $\Sigma$ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension.
  The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing MOTS. For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione to obtain a true genericity of null geodesic incompleteness around suitable initial data sets containing MOTS.</description>

      <title>A splitting theorem for manifolds with a convex boundary component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a warped product splitting theorem for manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below in the spirit of [Croke-Kleiner, \emph{Duke Math.\;J}.\;(1992)], but instead of asking that one boundary component is compact and mean convex, we require that it is parabolic and convex. The parabolicity assumption cannot be dropped as, otherwise, the catenoid in ambient dimension four would give a counterexample. The result is an application of recently developed tools in synthetic geometry.</description>

      <title>Index estimates for harmonic Gauss maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ denote a closed surface with constant mean curvature in $\mathbb{G}^3$, a 3-dimensional Lie group equipped with a bi-invariant metric. For such surfaces, there is a harmonic Gauss map which maps values to the unit sphere within the Lie algebra of $\mathbb{G}$. We prove that the energy index of the Gauss map of $\Sigma$ is bounded below by its topological genus. We also obtain index estimates in the case of complete non compact surfaces.</description>

      <title>Topological rigidity of small RCD(K,N) spaces with maximal rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polycyclic group $\Lambda$, rank$(\Lambda )$ is defined as the number of $\mathbb{Z}$ factors in a polycyclic decomposition of $\Lambda$. For a finitely generated group $G$, rank$(G)$ is defined as the infimum of rank$(\Lambda )$ among finite index polycyclic subgroups $\Lambda \leq G$.
  For a compact RCD$(K,N)$ space $(X,\mathsf{d}, \mathfrak{m} )$ with diam$(X) \leq \varepsilon (K,N)$, the rank of $\pi_1(X)$ is at most $N$. In this note we show that in case of equality, $X$ is homeomorphic to an infranilmanifold, generalizing to the non-smooth setting a result by Kapovitch--Wilking. We also fill a gap in the proof that if $\pi_1(X) = \mathbb{Z}^N$, then $X$ is bi-H\"older homeomorphic to a flat torus (diffeomorphic in the smooth case).</description>

      <title>Classification of differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff line with two origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify differentiable structures on a line $\mathbb{L}$ with two origins being a non-Hausdorff but $T_1$ one-dimensional manifold obtained by ``doubling'' $0$. For $k\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ let $H$ be the group of homeomorphisms $h$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(0)=0$ and the restriction of $h$ to $\mathbb{R}\setminus0$ is a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism. Let also $D$ be the subgroup of $H$ consisting of $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}$ also fixing $0$. It is shown that there is a natural bijection between $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism fixing both origins) and double $D$-coset classes $D \setminus H / D = \{ D h D \mid h \in H\}$.
  Moreover, the set of all $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism which may also exchange origins) are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of double $(D,\pm)$-coset classes $D \setminus H^{\pm} / D = \{ D h D \cup D h^{-1} D \mid h \in H\}$.
  In particular, in contrast with the real line, the line with two origins $\mathbb{L}$ admits uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures for each $k=1,2,\ldots,\infty$.</description>

      <title>The magnitude and spectral geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's notion of magnitude for a smooth manifold with boundary of arbitrary dimension, motivated by open questions for the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For a large class of distance functions, including embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds satisfying a technical condition, we show that the magnitude function is well defined for $R\gg 0$ and admits a meromorphic continuation to sectors in $\mathbb{C}$. In the semiclassical limit $R \to \infty$, the magnitude function admits an asymptotic expansion, which determines the volume, surface area and integrals of generalized curvatures. Lower-order terms are computed by black box computer algebra. We initiate the study of magnitude analogues to classical questions in spectral geometry and prove an asymptotic variant of the Leinster-Willerton conjecture.</description>

      <title>Effective formulas for the geometry of normal homogeneous spaces. Application to flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a smooth manifold and an action on it of a compact connected Lie group with a bi-invariant metric. Then, any orbit is an embedded submanifold that is isometric to a normal homogeneous space for the group. In this paper, we establish new explicit and intrinsic formulas for the geometry of any such orbit. We derive our formula of the Levi-Civita connection from an existing generic formula for normal homogeneous spaces, i.e. which determines, a priori only theoretically, the connection. We say that our formulas are effective: they are directly usable, notably in numerical analysis, provided that the ambient manifold is convenient for computations. Then, we deduce new effective formulas for flag manifolds, since we prove that they are orbits under a suitable action of the special orthogonal group on a product of Grassmannians. This representation of them is quite useful, notably for studying flags of eigenspaces of symmetric matrices. Thus, we develop from it a geometric solution to the problem of perturbation of eigenvectors which is explicit and optimal in a certain sense, improving the classical analytic solution.</description>

      <title>C^2-Morse Functions on the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space M_{g,n} bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a series of C^2-Morse functions on the Deligne-Mumford compactification M_{g,n} bar of the moduli space of genus g Riemann/hyperbolic surfaces with n punctures. This series of functions converges to the systole function, which is topologically Morse. We will show that the critical points of our functions approach those of systole sublinearly, stratum-wise, and with the same indices. These functions might be the first explicit examples of C^2-Morse functions on M_{g,n} bar, and the Morse handle decomposition may give rise to the first example of a natural cell decomposition of M_{g,n} bar, that works no matter if n is positive or equal to 0.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a strong generalized holomorphic (SGH) fiber bundle and develop connection and curvature theory for an SGH principal $G$-bundle over a regular generalized complex (GC) manifold, where $G$ is a complex Lie group. We develop a de Rham cohomology for regular GC manifolds, and a Dolbeault cohomology for SGH vector bundles. Moreover, we establish a Chern-Weil theory for SGH principal $G$-bundles under certain mild assumptions on the leaf space of the GC structure. We also present a Hodge theory along with associated dualities and vanishing theorems for SGH vector bundles. Several examples of SGH fiber bundles are given.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <title>Morse Index Stability for the Ginzburg-Landau Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behaviour of critical points of the Ginzburg-Landau perturbation of the Dirichlet energy into the sphere $E_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Sigma \frac{1}{2}|du|^2_h\ \,dvol_h +\frac{1}{4\varepsilon^2}(1-|u|^2)^2\,dvol_h=\int_{\Sigma}e_{\varepsilon}(u)$. Our first main result is a precise point-wise estimate for $e_\varepsilon(u_k)$ in the regions where compactness fails, which also implies the $L^{2,1}$ quantization in the bubbling process. Our second main result consists in applying the method developed in a previous joint paper with T. Rivi\`ere to study the upper-semi-continuity of the extended Morse index to sequences of critical points of $E_{\epsilon}$: given a sequence of critical points $u_{\varepsilon_k}:\Sigma\to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of $E_\varepsilon$ that converges in the bubble tree sense to a harmonic map $u_\infty\in W^{1,2}(\Sigma,{S}^{n})$ and bubbles $v^i_{\infty}:\mathbb{R}^2\to {S}^{n}$, we show that the extended Morse indices of the maps $v^i,u_\infty$ control the extended Morse index of the sequence $u_{\varepsilon_k}$ for $k$ large enough.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we will explore the fundamental concepts, including various basic concepts on $d$-complex manifolds, along with several differential operators and examine the relationships between them. A $d$-K\"ahler manifold is a $d$-complex manifold equipped with a metric that satisfies a specific condition. We prove the Hodge decomposition theorem on compact $d$-K\"ahler manifolds, which establishes a crucial relationship between certain de-Rham cohomology groups and Dolbeault cohomology groups on a compact $d$-K\"ahler manifold .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14904v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mapping properties of the X-ray transform and its adjoint on spaces of conormal functions on Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundary. After desingularizing the double fibration, and expressing the X-ray transform and its adjoint using b-fibrations operations, we employ tools related to Melrose's Pushforward Theorem to describe the mapping properties of these operators on various classes of polyhomogeneous functions, with special focus to computing how leading order coefficients are transformed. The appendix explains that a na\"ive use of the Pushforward Theorem leads to a suboptimal result with non-sharp index sets. Our improved results are obtained by closely inspecting Mellin functions which arise in the process, showing that certain coefficients vanish. This recovers some sharp results known by other methods. A number of consequences for the mapping properties of the X-ray transform and its normal operator(s) follow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a vanishing result for solutions of the inequality $|\Delta u|\le q_1|u|+q_2|\nabla u|$ that decay to zero along a very general warped cylindrical end of a Riemannian manifold. The appropriate decay condition at infinity on $u$ is related to the behavior of the potential functions $q_1$ and $q_2$ and to the asymptotic geometry of the end. The main ingredient is a new Carleman estimate of independent interest. Geometric applications to conformal deformations and to minimal graphs are presented.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>
