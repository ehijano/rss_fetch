      <title>Calculus for the Modern Engineer: Putting the Joy Back in Learning Advanced Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many engineering students enter college excited about math and physics, only to have their enthusiasm dimmed by a rigid, outdated calculus curriculum. The University of Michigan's Robotics Department is piloting a new 4-credit course, ``Calculus for the Modern Engineer,'' to reintroduce the excitement of learning advanced mathematics. Integrating Differential and Integral Calculus, vector derivatives, and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) into a unified one-semester curriculum, the course emphasizes conceptual mastery and real-world applications. It starts with definite integration -- building on students' intuitive understanding of sums -- before progressing through limits, differentiation, antiderivatives, and ODEs. By leveraging computational tools like Julia, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Wolfram Alpha Pro, it reduces reliance on tedious hand calculations. Case studies in numerical integration, optimization, and feedback control connect theory to engineering challenges. Supported by an open-source textbook and programming assignments, the course equips students with modern computational skills and reignites their passion for mathematics.</description>

      <title>Making mathematical online resources FAIR: at the example of small phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the process of taking an early 2000's mathematical library, the Small Phylogenetic Trees, and transforming it into a FAIR, modern, and sustainable repository for data from algebraic phylogenetics. This process is based on a three-fold strategy: (1) writing a software package which enables the user to reproduce results of the database; (2) setting up a user-friendly new website with cross links to theoretical publications, code snippets, and serialized output of computations; and (3) all-the-while documenting the steps we take in order to derive lessons learned which may be generalised to other such projects. This paper addresses (3). (1) is found in https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/Experimental/AlgebraicStatistics/phylogenetics, and (2) is located at https://algebraicphylogenetics.org.</description>

      <title>Impacto del Enfoque Matematicas en Tres Actos en la Educacion Matematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Mathematics in Three Acts" approach, proposed by Dan Meyer, aims to transform the teaching of mathematics through a model that encourages active student participation, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and metacognition. This study explores the implementation of this approach in a mathematics contest for secondary school students, evaluating its impact on various key competencies. Aspects such as mathematical creativity, problem-solving skills, metacognitive abilities, and students' perceptions of mathematics are examined. The results show that the approach contributes to the development of creative skills, improves understanding and problem-solving abilities, and increases student motivation and confidence. However, areas for improvement are also identified, particularly in the justification of procedures and cognitive flexibility. This study highlights the effectiveness of the "Mathematics in Three Acts" approach as an innovative methodology that fosters more meaningful, reflective, and autonomous learning, suggesting its potential to transform mathematics teaching in diverse educational contexts.</description>

      <title>Sophomore's dream function: asymptotics, complex plane behavior and relation to the error function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sophomore's dream sum $S=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n}$ is extended to the function $f(t,a)=t\int_{0}^{1}(ax)^{-tx}dx$ with $f(1,1)=S$, asymptotic behavior for a large $|t|$ being obtained. A more advanced approximation includes a half-derivative of the exponent and is expressed in terms of the error function. This approach provides excellent interpolation description in the complex plane. The function $f(t,a)$ demonstrates for $a&gt;1$ oscillating behavior along the imaginary axis with slowly increasing amplitude and the period of $2\pi iea$, modulation by high-frequency oscillations being present. Also, $f(t,a)$ has non-trivial zeros in the left complex half-plane with Im$t_n \simeq 2(n-1/8)\pi e/a$ for $a&gt;1$. The results obtained describe analytical integration of the function $x^{tx}$.</description>

      <title>Max/Min Puzzles in Geometry II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the investigation of finding the max/min polygons which can be inscribed in a given triangle. Here we are concerned with equilateral triangles. This may seem uninteresting or benign at first, but there are some surprises later.</description>
