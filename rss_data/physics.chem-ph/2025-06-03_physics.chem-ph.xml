      <title>Static Electric Dipole Polarizability and Hyperpolarizability Tensors from Mean-Field Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order electric dipole response functions are implemented for cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) generalizations of Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) in order to assess the degree to which static molecular response properties are impacted by interactions between electronic degrees of freedom and an optical cavity mode. Isotropically averaged static electric dipole polarizability tensors from QED-HF and QED-DFT are found to be somewhat insensitive to the presence of the cavity under realistic single-molecule coupling strengths. In contrast, the first hyperpolarizability tensor computed using QED-HF can be significantly modified by the cavity, depending on the relative orientation of the molecule and cavity mode polarization axis. For example, compared to the isolated molecule case, the isotropically averaged hyperpolarizability for $p$-nitroaniline decreases by more than 20% when the molecule is coupled to a single-mode optical cavity with a coupling strength of $|\lambda| = 0.05$ a.u. and when the cavity mode is polarized along the principal molecular axis. On the other hand, with this coupling strength and polarization, the isotropically averaged static dipole polarizability from QED-HF or QED-DFT decreases by only by only $\approx$ 2--5%, depending on the choice of DFT functional.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the ionization potential condition for localized electron removal in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal tuning of functional parameters in density functional theory approximations, based on enforcing the ionization potential theorem, has emerged as the method of choice for the non-empirical prediction of the electronic structure of finite systems. This method has recently been extended to the bulk limit, based on an ansatz that generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the removal of an electron from a localized Wannier orbital. This Wannier-localization based optimal tuning method has been shown to be highly successful for a wide range of periodic systems, accurately predicting electronic and optical properties. However, a rigorous theoretical justification for its foundational ansatz has been lacking. Here, we establish an ionization potential condition for the removal of a localized electron, by extending the piecewise linearity and Janak's theorems in density functional theory. We also provide numerical evidence supporting our theory.</description>

      <title>Evidence for supramolecular dynamics of non-hydrogen bonding polar van der Waals liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-hydrogen bonding van der Waals liquids with dipole-dipole interactions are typically viewed as non-associative and not considered able to sustain large supramolecular structures. Combining broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) and rheology, we demonstrate the supramolecular formation in a group of non-hydrogen-bonding van der Waals liquids, i.e. 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane, 1-chloro-2-ethylhexane, and 1-bromo-3,7-dimethyloctane. BDS shows an emergence of a Debye-like process slower than their structural relaxation, which follows super-Arrhenius temperature dependence. Meanwhile, rheological measurements reveal a noticeable dynamical separation between the terminal relaxation and the structural rearrangements. Interestingly, the rheological terminal time agrees remarkably well with the dielectric Debye-like relaxation time, pointing to a strong coupling between the terminal flow and the supramolecular dynamics of these van der Waals liquids. These results highlight the role of intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions on the structure and slow dynamics of van der Waals liquids.</description>

      <title>A Simple Iterative Approach for Constant Chemical Potential Simulations at Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical potential of species in solution is essential for understanding various chemical processes at interfaces. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, constrained by fixed compositions, cannot satisfy a constant chemical potential condition as solute species can migrate to the interface and deplete the bulk due to solute-interface interactions. In this study, we introduce a simple and computationally efficient approach named iterative constant chemical potential molecular dynamics (iCuMD) simulation, which helps simulate targeted molar concentrations of species in solution. iCuMD overcomes the limitations of conventional MD by adjusting the number of species in the solution to reach a target concentration (chemical potential). We demonstrate our approach using solid-liquid and liquid-air interfacial systems as case studies. Specifically, we perform classical force field-based MD simulations of NaCl(aq)-air and NaCl(aq)-graphite interfaces and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-based MD simulations of the Na2SO4(aq)-graphene interface. Our results show that the iCuMD approach efficiently achieves the desired bulk ion concentration within two iterations and can also be integrated with MLIP-driven simulations which enable constant potential simulations with DFT-level accuracy. We show that iCuMD offers a robust and simple computational framework for constant chemical potential simulations as its only requirement is to be able to converge interfacial simulations with a measurable bulk region.</description>

      <title>Impact of hydrogen addition, up to 20 % (mol/mol), on the thermodynamic ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) properties of a reference high-calorific natural gas mixture with significant ethane and propane content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injecting hydrogen into the natural gas grid supports gradual decarbonization. To check the accuracy of equations of state for hydrogen-enriched natural gas mixtures, precise density data from well-characterized reference mixtures are essential. In a prior study, we provided experimental measurements for a natural gas constituted mainly of methane and for two derived hydrogen-enriched mixtures. In the present study, being the second and final part of our investigation, density measurements for a high-calorific natural gas with significant ethane and propane content, along with two hydrogen-enriched variants (10 and 20 mol-% hydrogen) are provided. The mixtures are gravimetrically prepared following ISO 6142-1. Density measurements, conducted with a single-sinker densimeter at temperatures from (260-350) K and pressures up to 20 MPa, are compared with three equations of state: AGA8-DC92, GERG-2008, and an improved GERG-2008. Results indicate that all models perform better for methane-dominant mixtures than for those containing heavier hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Image-based measurements of Tafel slopes in aqueous MV/4-HO-TEMPO Flow Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A total organic aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) employing methyl viologen (MV) electrolyte and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-HO-TEMPO) is tested and characterized under microfluidic conditions. The absence of physical membrane and the quasi-two-dimensional energy transfers occurring in this RFB design enables the first direct measurement of Tafel kinetics, charge transfer, and charge transport resistances for both anolyte and catholyte reactants during the RFB operations. The methodology reported in this work combines spectroelectrochemical imaging and analytical modeling of the periodic mass and charge transfer equations. The Tafel kinetics and charge transfers resistances are measured through several RFB geometries and operating conditions without the need of reference electrode nor absorptivity coefficient calibration, which simplifies the experimental setup, eases the measurements and suppresses the uncertainty related to the electrolyte potential value. Data provided in this work (concentration fields, kinetics properties, electrochemical impedances) quantify the charge transfer in these systems and can serve as reference values for further advanced RFB numerical simulations and design optimization.</description>

      <title>Equation of State and First Principles Prediction of the Vibrational Matrix Shift of Solid Parahydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generate the equation of state (EOS) of solid parahydrogen using a path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation based on a highly accurate first-principles adiabatic hindered rotor (AHR) potential energy curve for the \para dimer. The EOS curves for the fcc and hcp structures of solid parahydrogen near the equilibrium density show that the hcp structure is the more stable of the two, in agreement with experiment. To accurately reproduce the structural and energy properties of solid parahydrogen, we eliminated by extrapolation the systematic errors associated with the choice of simulation parameters used in the PIMC calculation. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the EOS curves, and the invariance of the equilibrium density with temperature is satisfyingly reproduced. The pressure as a function of density, and the compressibility as a function of pressure, are both calculated using the obtained EOS and are compared with previous simulation results and experiments. We also report the first ever a priori prediction of a vibrational matrix shift from first-principles two-body potential functions, and its result for the equilibrium state agrees well with experiment.</description>

      <title>Fuelprop: Fuel property prediction from ATR-FTIR spectroscopic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic fuels are crucial for decarbonizing the transportation sector. A significant challenge lies in the rapid and efficient characterization of these fuels. Chemometric methods using ATR-FTIR data offer a potential alternative to conventional techniques. This study expands the applicability and performance of chemometric models by providing an extensive ATR-FTIR spectral dataset and exploring various data enhancement strategies. Data enhancement was achieved by semi-supervised data generation, consistency enforcement through unsupervised data augmentation, and data imputation using synthetic spectra blending and pseudo-labeling. Models were trained on surrogate fuels and rigorously tested on real fuels, representing out-of-distribution testing conditions. We believe that this work will enhance the adoption of chemometric models for fuel characterization.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatically driven quantum interference effects in the ultracold K + KRb $\longrightarrow$ Rb + K$_{2}$ chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The K + KRb $\longrightarrow$ Rb + K$_{2}$ chemical reaction is the first ultracold atom-diatom chemical reaction for which experimental results have been reported for temperatures below 1 $\mu$K more than a decade ago. The reaction occurs through coupling with an excited electronic state that is accessible even in the ultracold limit. A previous quantum dynamics study, excluding non-adiabatic effects, has reported a rate coefficient that is about 35\% below the experimental value. Here, we report the first non-adiabatic quantum dynamics study of this reaction and obtain rate coefficients in better agreement with experiments. Our results show that short-range dynamics mediated by coupling with the excited electronic state introduces quantum interference effects that influence both the state-to-state rate coefficients and the overall reaction rates.</description>

      <title>How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheetham NaCl model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient large scale computer simulations of complex aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the growing complexity of these systems is evidencing the difficulties to describe solution properties without due account of polarization. Conflicting strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of the solvated ions.
  In this work we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized with an emphasis in the prediction of the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The overall performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P$/\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally good, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, as well as surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe solution densities for model ions targeted to their crystal and melt properties. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and cast some doubt on the need for the appealing concept of charge scaling.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spherulitic Crystal Growth from Salt Mixtures: A Universal Mechanism for Complex Crystal Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherulites are complex polycrystalline structures that form through the self-assembly of small aggregated nanocrystals starting from a central point and growing radially outward. Despite their wide prevalence and relevance to fields ranging from geology to medicine, the dynamics of spherulitic crystallization and the conditions required for such growth remain ill-understood. Here, we report on the conditions to induce controlled spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate from evaporating aqueous solutions of sulfate salt mixtures at room temperature. We reveal that introducing divalent metal ions in the solution cause spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate. For the first time, we quantify the supersaturation at the onset of spherulitic growth from salt mixtures and determine the growth kinetics. Our results show that the nonclassical nucleation process induces the growth of sodium sulfate spherulites at high supersaturation in highly viscous solutions. The latter reaches approximately 111 Pa$\cdot$s, triggered by the divalent ions, at the onset of spherulite precipitation leading to a diffusion limited growth. We also show that spherulites, which are metastable structures formed under out-of-equilibrium conditions, can evolve into other shapes when supersaturation decreases as growth continues at different evaporation rates. These findings shed light on the conditions under which spherulites form and offer practical strategies for tuning their morphology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the fabrication and optimization of semi-transparent antimony sulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$) thin-film solar cells in a superstrate configuration, using RF magnetron sputtering of metallic antimony followed by post-deposition sulfurization. The influence of absorber and buffer layer thicknesses on device performance was systematically studied in FTO/CdS/Sb$_2$S$_3$/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au architectures. Optimizing the Sb$_2$S$_3$ absorber thickness to 100 nm yielded a champion device with a power conversion efficiency of 2.76\%, short-circuit current density of 14 mA/cm$^2$, and open-circuit voltage of 650 mV. The devices exhibit up to 20\% transmittance in the 380--740 nm wavelength range, indicating their suitability for indoor and building-integrated photovoltaic applications. Structural and compositional analyses confirmed high-purity Sb$_2$S$_3$ (more than 90 at.\%) and improved crystallinity after sulfurization. These results demonstrate the potential of sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ as a scalable and tunable absorber for emerging transparent thin-film solar technologies and highlight the critical role of thickness optimization and interface control in device performance.</description>

      <title>Learning collective variables that preserve transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective variables (CVs) play a crucial role in capturing rare events in high-dimensional systems, motivating the continual search for principled approaches to their design. In this work, we revisit the framework of quantitative coarse graining and identify the orthogonality condition from Legoll and Lelievre (2010) as a key criterion for constructing CVs that accurately preserve the statistical properties of the original process. We establish that satisfaction of the orthogonality condition enables error estimates for both relative entropy and pathwise distance to scale proportionally with the degree of scale separation. Building on this foundation, we introduce a general numerical method for designing neural network-based CVs that integrates tools from manifold learning with group-invariant featurization. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we construct CVs for butane and achieve a CV that reproduces the anti-gauche transition rate with less than ten percent relative error. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence challenging the necessity of uniform positive definiteness in diffusion tensors for transition rate reproduction and highlight the critical role of light atoms in CV design for molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate phase transitions on nanoclusters from nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling was employed to investigate adsorption equilibria on the truncated-octahedral Lennard-Jones nanocluster LJ$_{38}$ while systematically varying adsorbate-surface well depth and Lennard-Jones size parameters. Evaluation of the canonical partition function over a wide temperature range identifies two successive phase transitions: (i) condensation of the gas phase onto the cluster surface at higher temperatures, and (ii) lateral rearrangement of the adsorbed layer at lower temperatures. For identical interactions, the condensate first populates both three- and four-fold hollow sites; when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are weakened, preference shifts to the four-coordinated (100) sites. Size mismatch governs low-temperature behavior: smaller adsorbates aggregate to increase mutual contacts, whereas larger ones distribute more evenly to maximize coordination with the cluster. These findings highlight key trends in facet competition and lattice mismatch, and showcase nested sampling as an automated, unbiased tool for exploring surface configurational space and guiding investigations of more complex, realistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Nanoelectrospray ionization coupled to a linear charge detection array ion trap spectrometer for single viral particles analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the implementation of a new charge detection mass spectrometer (CDMS) design that operates in a stand-alone mode, thanks to its integration with nanoelectrospray ionization. More specifically, this innovative CDMS consists of a linear charge detection array ion trap spectrometer that combines an eight-tube detector array with conical electrodes. This configuration allows for recording data in both transmission mode (linear array) and ion trapping mode (ConeArrayTrap), which enables the measurement of time-of-flight (related to the mass-to-charge ratio) along with the charge of individual ions. As a result, this design supports high-throughput metrology of viruses at the single-particle level. The devices and geometry of the instrument have been developed based on ion optics simulations. The performance of the current instrument is demonstrated using human norovirus-like particles (hNoVLP) and Adenovirus Ad(5) (hAdV5).</description>

      <title>Micelle Forming Linear-Dendritic Block Copolymers: A Theoretical Comparison between Random Hyperbranched and Precise Dendrimer Polymer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbranched block copolymers offer a simpler and more efficient synthesis route compared to more traditional dendritic systems, while still providing exceptional control over surface functionality and self-assembly. This makes them ideal candidates for engineering nanoparticles with tailored properties for applications such as drug delivery and sensing. Here we use self-consistent field calculations to compare the micelle structures formed by copolymers with a polydisperse hyperbranched (LHBC), monodisperse dendritic (LDBC), and linear solvophilic blocks. Representative LHBC structures were generated by molecular dynamics simulations mimicking the slow-monomer addition protocol. We find that LHBC micelles are more stable, have a lower critical micelle concentration, and are better at accommodating larger drug payloads than LDBC micelles, and these properties further improve with increasing polydispersity. LHBC micelles also offer more terminal ends for functionalization than LDBC micelles for LDBCs with up to four branching generations, with the number of terminal ends being surprisingly independent of the LHBC polydispersity. Our findings highlight the superiority of LHBC micelles in flexibility and performance over LDBC micelles.</description>

      <title>Alchemical diastereomers from antisymmetric alchemical perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy difference between two iso-electronic systems can be accurately approximated by the alchemical first order Hellmann-Feynmann derivative for the averaged Hamiltonian. This approximation is exact up to third order because even-order contributions cancel out. This finding holds for any iso-electronic compound pair (dubbed `alchemical diastereomers'), regardless of differences in configuration, composition, or energy, and consequently, relative energy estimates for all possible iso-electronic alchemical diastereomer pairs, require only O(1) self-consistent field cycles for any given averaging reference Hamiltonian. We discuss the relation to the Verlet algorithm, alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) [J. Chem. Phys. 162, 044101 (2025)], relative properties such as forces, ionization potential or electron affinities, and Levy's formula for relative energies among iso-electronic systems that uses the averaged electron density of the two systems [J. Chem. Phys. 70, 1573 (1979)]. Numerical estimates accurately reflect trends in the charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomic molecule series with 14 protons (N$_2$, CO, BF, BeNe, LiNa, HeMg, HAl), with systematically increasing errors. Using alchemical Hellmann-Feynman derivatives for toluene, we demonstrate the concept's broader applicability by estimating relative energies for all 36 possible alchemical diastereomer pairs from vertical iso-electronic charge-neutral antisymmetric BN doping of toluene's aromatic ring, with mean absolute errors of a few milli-Hartrees.</description>

      <title>Collectively-modified inter-molecular electron correlations: The connection of polaritonic chemistry and spin glass physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed many-molecules electronic-structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model of a spin glass. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability of the intermolecular electron correlations, which could provide the long sought-after seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. Overall, the qualitative predictions made from the SSK model (e.g., dispersion effects, phase transitions, differently modified bulk and rare event properties, heating,...) agree well with available experimental observations. Our connection paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as modified fluctuation-dissipation relations, (non-equilibrium) aging dynamics, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the connection also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems suggesting novel theoretical directions such as spin glasses with explicitly time-dependent (random) interactions.</description>

      <title>Self-replicating fuels via autocatalytic molecular bond fission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This computational study advances a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields and product formation rates as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled back to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry displays 2^n stoichiometries with respect to formate growth in the limit of ideal reaction selectivity. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle shows direct analogy to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production are accessible even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Significant focus is placed on practical routes for realizing each of the three steps comprising this model case of formate replication, particularly the challenge of formate carboxylation and the corresponding energy demands and power constraints of the overall process.</description>

Abstract: A generalised extraction procedure for magnetic interactions using effective Hamiltonians is presented that is applicable to systems with more than two sites featuring local spins $S_i \geq 1$. To this end, closed, non-recursive expressions pertaining to chains of arbitrary equal spins are derived with the graphical method of angular momentum. The method is illustrated by extracting magnetic couplings from ab initio calculations on a [CaMn$_3$$^{(IV)}$O$_4$] cubane. An extension to non-sequential coupling schemes proves conducive to expressing additional symmetries of certain spin Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11569v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, has revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach, suggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency -- and that energy conservation can be learned during training. This work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, energy conservation is hard to learn, monitor, and correct for. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force prediction might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing -- rather than eliminating -- the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Attenuated Exchange for Generalized TDHF@$v_W$ Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon our previously developed time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)@$v_W$ method, based on many-body perturbation theory and specifically the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE), we introduce a parameterization scheme for the attenuated exchange kernel, $v_W(|r - r'|)$. In the original method, $v_W$ was determined individually for each system via an efficient stochastic short-time TD Hartree propagation for the screened Coulomb interaction, $W(r,r')$. The new parameterization leverages photochemical similarities in exciton binding energies (or exchange interaction attenuation) among molecules with comparable static dielectric responses. We parameterize the inverse dielectric function using a low-order polynomial with error function apodization, calibrated on a few representative molecules, each with its own $v_W$. Using only 7 parameters, the parameterized $v_W$ is fully grid-independent and broadly applicable within a family of molecules. This enables TDHF@$v_W$ that retains BSE-level accuracy, achieving a mean absolute error of $\sim0.1$ eV compared to experimental optical gaps and representing a five- to ten-fold improvement over conventional TD density functional theory or TDHF while reducing the cost to that of standard TDHF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in quantum chemistry is the accurate modeling of strong electron correlation. While multireference methods effectively capture such correlation, their steep scaling with system size prohibits their application to large molecules and extended materials. Quantum embedding offers a promising solution by partitioning complex systems into manageable subsystems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in multireference density matrix embedding and localized active space self-consistent field approaches for complex molecules and extended materials. We discuss both classical implementations and the emerging potential of these methods on quantum computers. By extending classical embedding concepts to the quantum landscape, these algorithms have the potential to expand the reach of multireference methods in quantum chemistry and materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a catalyst-free, ambient-temperature method for synthesizing nitrogen-based compounds critical to fertilizer production, including ammonia, urea, ammonium salts, and amino acids. The process relies on bubble-burst-induced microenvironments, where gas bubbles undergo rapid growth and collapse, releasing intense localized energy sufficient to dissociate nitrogen and water molecules. These high-energy zones produce reactive species, including atomic hydrogen (H*) that facilitate nitrogen fixation and drive subsequent chemical transformations without needing catalysts or elevated conditions. Experimental validation using colorimetric assays, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy confirms the in situ formation of ammonia and its downstream conversion into structurally relevant compounds, including peptide-like assemblies. The system supports reaction tuning through dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) or organic acids and can be enhanced by low-energy inputs such as UV or ultrasound. Its simplicity, modularity, and ability to operate without external infrastructure offer a practical and scalable platform for decentralized fertilizer generation and sustainable biochemical production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced atomic magnetometers have made it possible to acquire nuclear magnetic resonance spectra in zero to ultralow magnetic fields. This regime carries the benefit of compact, low-cost instrumentation with reduced spin relaxation effects and the ability to probe phenomena that are inaccessible in conventional high-field experiments. A tradeoff is that the resulting spectra must be interpreted using simulations that are taxing for classical computation. Working by example for small-molecule and protein spectroscopy, we demonstrate that these simulations are a promising target for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our holistic analysis spans from input selection to the construction of explicit circuits for qubitized quantum dynamics. By maintaining parity with experimental requirements, we demonstrate how certain cases might be especially promising for early fault-tolerant architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions of molecules with their environment influence the course and outcome of almost all chemical reactions. However, classical computers struggle to accurately simulate complicated molecule-environment interactions because of the steep growth of computational resources with both molecule size and environment complexity. Therefore, many quantum-chemical simulations are restricted to isolated molecules, whose dynamics can dramatically differ from what happens in an environment. Here, we show that analog quantum simulators can simulate open molecular systems by using the native dissipation of the simulator and injecting additional controllable dissipation. By exploiting the native dissipation to simulate the molecular dissipation -- rather than seeing it as a limitation -- our approach enables longer simulations of open systems than are possible for closed systems. In particular, we show that trapped-ion simulators using a mixed qudit-boson (MQB) encoding could simulate molecules in a wide range of condensed phases by implementing widely used dissipative processes within the Lindblad formalism, including pure dephasing and both electronic and vibrational relaxation. The MQB open-system simulations require significantly fewer additional quantum resources compared to both classical and digital quantum approaches.</description>

      <title>FragNet: A Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction with Four Levels of Interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is essential in a variety of contemporary scientific fields, such as drug development and designing energy storage materials. Although there are many machine learning models available for this purpose, those that achieve high accuracy while also offering interpretability of predictions are uncommon. We present a graph neural network that not only matches the prediction accuracies of leading models but also provides insights on four levels of molecular substructures. This model helps identify which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and connections between fragments are significant for predicting a specific molecular property. Understanding the importance of connections between fragments is particularly valuable for molecules with substructures that do not connect through standard bonds. The model additionally can quantify the impact of specific fragments on the prediction, allowing the identification of fragments that may improve or degrade a property value. These interpretable features are essential for deriving scientific insights from the model's learned relationships between molecular structures and properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are easier to satisfy. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

      <title>Uncovering relationships between the electronic self-energy and coupled-cluster doubles theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Tokenizing Electron Cloud in Protein-Ligand Interaction Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The affinity and specificity of protein-molecule binding directly impact functional outcomes, uncovering the mechanisms underlying biological regulation and signal transduction. Most deep-learning-based prediction approaches focus on structures of atoms or fragments. However, quantum chemical properties, such as electronic structures, are the key to unveiling interaction patterns but remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ECBind, a method for tokenizing electron cloud signals into quantized embeddings, enabling their integration into downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction. By incorporating electron densities, ECBind helps uncover binding modes that cannot be fully represented by atom-level models. Specifically, to remove the redundancy inherent in electron cloud signals, a structure-aware transformer and hierarchical codebooks encode 3D binding sites enriched with electron structures into tokens. These tokenized codes are then used for specific tasks with labels. To extend its applicability to a wider range of scenarios, we utilize knowledge distillation to develop an electron-cloud-agnostic prediction model. Experimentally, ECBind demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, achieving improvements of 6.42\% and 15.58\% in per-structure Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum and spin-detection axis. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</description>
