      <title>The Impact of Formations on Football Matches Using Double Machine Learning. Is it worth parking the bus?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a central tactical dilemma for football coaches: whether to employ a defensive strategy, colloquially known as "parking the bus", or a more offensive one. Using an advanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, this project provides a robust and interpretable tool to estimate the causal impact of different formations on key match outcomes such as goal difference, possession, corners, and disciplinary actions. Leveraging a dataset of over 22,000 matches from top European leagues, formations were categorized into six representative types based on tactical structure and expert consultation. A major methodological contribution lies in the adaptation of DML to handle categorical treatments, specifically formation combinations, through a novel matrix-based residualization process, allowing for a detailed estimation of formation-versus-formation effects that can inform a coach's tactical decision-making. Results show that while offensive formations like 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 offer modest statistical advantages in possession and corners, their impact on goals is limited. Furthermore, no evidence supports the idea that defensive formations, commonly associated with parking the bus, increase a team's winning potential. Additionally, red cards appear unaffected by formation choice, suggesting other behavioral factors dominate. Although this approach does not fully capture all aspects of playing style or team strength, it provides a valuable framework for coaches to analyze tactical efficiency and sets a precedent for future research in sports analytics.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Respiratory Emergency Department Visits: A Mediation Analysis with Ambient Ozone Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temperatures are associated with adverse respiratory health outcomes and increases in ambient air pollution. Limited research has quantified air pollution's mediating role in the relationship between temperature and respiratory morbidity, such as emergency department (ED) visits. In this study, we conducted a causal mediation analysis to decompose the total effect of daily temperature on respiratory ED visits in Los Angeles from 2005 to 2016. We focused on ambient ozone as a mediator because its precursors and formation are directly driven by sunlight and temperature. We estimated natural direct, indirect, and total effects on the relative risk scale across deciles of temperature exposure compared to the median. We utilized Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to flexibly characterize the nonlinear relationship between temperature and ozone and quantified uncertainty via posterior prediction and the Bayesian bootstrap. Our results showed that ozone partially mediated the association between high temperatures and respiratory ED visits, particularly at moderately high temperatures. We also validated our modeling approach through simulation studies. This study extends the existing literature by considering acute respiratory morbidity and employing a flexible modeling approach, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying temperature-related health risks.</description>

      <title>Using Time Series Measures to Explore Family Planning Survey Data and Model-based Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Family planning is a global development priority and a key indicator of reproductive health. Monitoring progress is challenged by gaps in survey data across countries. The United Nations Population Division addresses this with the Family Planning Estimation Model (FPEM), a Bayesian hierarchical time series model producing annual estimates of modern contraceptive use while sharing information across countries and regions. This paper evaluates how well FPEM estimates align with survey data using time series diagnostic indices from the wdiexplorer R package, which account for countries nested within sub-regions. Visualisation of survey data, modelled trajectories, and diagnostics enables assessment of model performance, highlighting where trends align and where discrepancies occur.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the limits of human athletic performance: A Bayesian analysis of elite decathletes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because the decathlon tests many facets of athleticism, including sprinting, throwing, jumping, and endurance, many consider it to be the ultimate test of athletic ability. On this view, estimating the maximal decathlon score and understanding what it would take to achieve that score provides insight into the upper limits of human athletic potential. To this end, we develop a Bayesian composition model for forecasting how individual athletes perform in each of the 10 decathlon events of time. Besides capturing potential non-linear temporal trends in performance, our model carefully captures the dependence between performance in an event and all preceding events. Using our model, we can simulate and evaluate the distribution of the maximal possible scores and identify profiles of athletes who could realistically attain scores approaching this limit.</description>

      <title>Environmental policy in the context of complex systems: Statistical optimization and sensitivity analysis for ABMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled human-environment systems are increasingly being understood as complex adaptive systems (CAS), in which micro-level interactions between components lead to emergent behavior. Agent-based models (ABMs) hold great promise for environmental policy design by capturing such complex behavior, enabling a sophisticated understanding of potential interventions. One limitation, however, is that ABMs can be computationally costly to simulate, which hinders their use for policy optimization. To address this, we propose a new statistical framework that exploits machine learning techniques to accelerate policy optimization with costly ABMs. We first develop a statistical approach for sensitivity testing of the optimal policy, then leverage a reinforcement learning method for efficient policy optimization. We test this framework on the classic ``Sugarscape'' model, an ABM for resource harvesting. We show that our approach can quickly identify optimal and interpretable policies that improve upon baseline techniques, with insightful sensitivity and dynamic analyses that connect back to economic theory.</description>

      <title>huff: A Python package for Market Area Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market area models, such as the Huff model and its extensions, are widely used to estimate regional market shares and customer flows of retail and service locations. Another, now very common, area of application is the analysis of catchment areas, supply structures and the accessibility of healthcare locations. The huff Python package provides a complete workflow for market area analysis, including data import, construction of origin-destination interaction matrices, basic model analysis, parameter estimation from empirical data, calculation of distance or travel time indicators, and map visualization. Additionally, the package provides several methods of spatial accessibility analysis. The package is modular and object-oriented. It is intended for researchers in economic geography, regional economics, spatial planning, marketing, geoinformation science, and health geography. The software is openly available via the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/huff/); its development and version history are managed in a public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/geowieland/huff_official) and archived at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18639559).</description>

      <title>Cinder: A fast and fair matchmaking system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.</description>

      <title>BMW: Bayesian Model-Assisted Adaptive Phase II Clinical Trial Design for Win Ratio Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The win ratio (WR) statistic is increasingly used to evaluate treatment effects based on prioritized composite endpoints, yet existing Bayesian adaptive designs are not directly applicable because the WR is a summary statistic derived from pairwise comparisons and does not correspond to a unique data-generating mechanism. We propose a Bayesian model-assisted adaptive design for randomized phase II clinical trials based on the WR statistic, referred to as the BMW design. The proposed design uses the joint asymptotic distribution of WR test statistics across interim and final analyses to compute posterior probabilities without specifying the underlying outcome distribution. The BMW design allows flexible interim monitoring with early stopping for futility or superiority and is extended to jointly evaluate efficacy and toxicity using a graphical testing procedure that controls the family-wise error rate (FWER). Simulation studies demonstrate that the BMW design maintains valid type I error and FWER control, achieves power comparable to conventional methods, and substantially reduces expected sample size. An R Shiny application is provided to facilitate practical implementation.</description>

      <title>SOLVAR: Fast covariance-based heterogeneity analysis with pose refinement for cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful technique for resolving the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency. SOLVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets in a recent heterogeneity benchmark. The code of the algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/RoeyYadgar/SOLVAR.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Selection of Low-Risk Oncology Patients for Survival Beyond a Time Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset of patients who are unlikely to experience an adverse event within a fixed time horizon by calibrating a screening rule based on a black-box survival model. We consider two complementary, distribution-free frameworks for this task. The first extends classical calibration ideas -- estimating the event rate among selected patients using a hold-out dataset -- by integrating them with the Learn-Then-Test (LTT) framework, yielding high-probability guarantees for data-adaptively tuned screening rules. The second takes a different perspective by reformulating screening as a hypothesis testing problem on future patient outcomes, enabling false discovery rate (FDR) control via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure applied to selective conformal p-values, and providing guarantees in expectation. We clarify the theoretical relationship between these approaches, explain how both can be adapted to right-censored time-to-event data via inverse probability of censoring weighting, and compare them empirically using simulations and oncology data from the Flatiron Health Research Database. Our results reveal a trade-off between efficiency and strength of guarantees: FDR-based screening is typically more powerful, while LTT-based calibration is more conservative but offers stronger guarantees. We also provide practical guidance on implementation and tuning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Memory Effects: Sparse Identification in Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the human burden of vector-borne diseases from limited surveillance data remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of nonlinear transmission dynamics and delayed effects arising from vector ecology and human behavior. We develop a data-driven framework based on an extension of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to systems with distributed memory, enabling discovery of transmission mechanisms directly from time series data. Using severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) as a case study, we show that this approach can uncover key features of tick-borne disease dynamics using only human incidence and local temperature data, without imposing predefined assumptions on human case reporting. We further demonstrate that predictive performance is substantially enhanced when the data-driven model is coupled with mechanistic representations of tick-host transmission pathways informed by empirical studies. The framework supports systematic sensitivity analysis of memory kernels and behavioral parameters, identifying those most influential for prediction accuracy. Although the approach prioritizes predictive accuracy over mechanistic transparency, it yields sparse, interpretable integral representations suitable for epidemiological forecasting. This hybrid methodology provides a scalable strategy for forecasting vector-borne disease risk and informing public health decision-making under data limitations.</description>

      <title>Conjugating Variational Inference for Large Mixed Multinomial Logit Models and Consumer Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity in multinomial choice data is often accounted for using logit models with random coefficients. Such models are called "mixed", but they can be difficult to estimate for large datasets. We review current Bayesian variational inference (VI) methods that can do so, and propose a new VI method that scales more effectively. The key innovation is a step that updates efficiently a Gaussian approximation to the conditional posterior of the random coefficients, addressing a bottleneck within the variational optimization. The approach is used to estimate three types of mixed logit models: standard, nested and bundle variants. We first demonstrate the improvement of our new approach over existing VI methods using simulations. Our method is then applied to a large scanner panel dataset of pasta choice. We find consumer response to price and promotion variables exhibits substantial heterogeneity at the grocery store and product levels. Store size, premium and geography are found to be drivers of store level estimates of price elasticities. Extension to bundle choice with pasta sauce improves model accuracy further. Predictions from the mixed models are more accurate than those from fixed coefficients equivalents, and our VI method provides insights in circumstances which other methods find challenging.</description>
