      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a new way of their construction.
  We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. They are essentially so-called Reeb graphs of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>The comparison of the 0-th Suslin homology and Chow groups of 0-cycles with modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for a $K_0$-regular projective normal surface $X$ over a perfect field $k$ of positive characteristic and a reduced effective Cartier divisor $D\hookrightarrow X$, the Chow group of zero cycles on $X$ with modulus $D$ coincides with the 0-th Suslin homology of $X\setminus D$. Moreover, we show that this isomorphism also holds for a projective smooth scheme of any dimension with a reduced effective Cartier divisor.</description>

      <title>On the coupled stability thresholds of graded linear series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we see several basic properties of graded linear series. We firstly see that, if a graded linear series contains an ample series, then so are the pullbacks of the system under birational morphisms. Using this proposition, we define the refinements of graded linear series with respects to primitive flags. Moreover, we give several formulas to compute the $S$-invariant of those refinements. Secondly, we introduce the notion of coupled stability thresholds for graded linear series, which is a generalization of the notion introduced by Rubinstein--Tian--Zhang. We see that, over the interior of the support for finite numbers of graded linear series containing an ample series, the coupled stability threshold function can be uniquely extended continuously, which generalizes the work by Kewei Zhang. Thirdly, we get a product-type formula for coupled stability thresholds, which generalizes the work of Zhuang. Fourthly, we see Abban--Zhuang's type formulas for estimating local coupled stability thresholds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We interpret the coupled Ding semistability and the reduced coupled uniform Ding stability of log Fano pairs in the notion of coupled stability thresholds and reduced coupled stability thresholds. As a corollary, we solve a modified version of the conjecture by Hultgren and Witt Nystr\"om for coupled K\"ahler--Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the topology of Brill-Noether varieties associated to real trigonal curves. More precisely, we aim to count the connected components of the real locus of the varieties parametrizing linear systems of degree $d$ and dimension at least $r$. We do this count when the relations $m=g-d+r-1\leq d-2r-1$ are satisfied, where $m$ is the Maroni invariant and $g$ is the genus of the curve.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on Cox rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a graded cluster algebra structure on the Cox ring of a smooth complex variety $Z$, depending on a base cluster structure on the ring of regular functions of an open subset $Y$ of $Z$. After considering some elementary examples of our construction, including toric varieties, we discuss the two main applications. First: if $Z$ is a flag variety and $Y$ is the open Schubert cell, we prove that our results recover, by geometric methods, a well known construction of Geiss, Leclerc and Schr\"oer. Second: we define the diagonal partial compactification of a (finite type) cluster variety, and prove that its Cox ring is a graded upper cluster algebra. Along the way, we explain how similar constructions can be done if we replace the Cox ring with a ring of global sections of a sheaf of divisorial algebras on $Z$.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and the Emergence of Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity (QG) amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>

      <title>KdV Equation for Theta Functions on Non-commutative Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of non-commutative geometry and string theory, quantum tori appear in different mathematical and physical contexts. Therefore, quantized theta functions defined on quantum tori are also studied (Yu. I. Manin, A. Schwartz; note that a comparison between the two definitions of quantum theta is still an open problem). One important application of classical theta functions is in soliton theory. Certain soliton equations, including the KdV equation, have algebro-geometric solutions that are given by theta functions (we refer to F. Gesztesy and H. Holden), and as such belong to an "integrable hierarchy." While quantized integrability is a very active and complicated subject, in this work we take a different, naive approach. We conduct an experiment: using a definition of differentiation on quantum tori (M. Rieffel), we ask whether the quantum theta function satisfies non-linear PDE. The experiment is successful on the 2-torus and for the KdV equation. This opens the way to future investigations, such as the quest for a compatible hierarchy satisfied by quantum theta, and a consistent definition of complete integrability.</description>

      <title>Arakelov geometry of toric bundles: Okounkov bodies and BKK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces the study of toric bundles and the morphisms between them from the perspective of adelic fibre bundles, as introduced by Chambert-Loir and Tschinkel. We study the Okounkov bodies and Boucksom-Chen transforms of suitable adelic line bundles on toric bundles. Finally, we prove an arithmetic analogue of a formula for intersection numbers due to Hofscheier, Khovanskii and Monin. We apply this to the study of compactifications of semiabelian varieties, whose height and successive minima we compute. This extends computations of Chambert-Loir to arbitrary toric compactifications.</description>

Abstract: We put forward a conjecture for the leading constant in Malle's conjecture on number fields of bounded discriminant, guided by stacky versions of conjectures of Batyrev-Manin, Batyrev-Tschinkel, and Peyre on rational points of bounded height on Fano varieties. A new framework for Brauer groups of stacks plays a key role in our conjecture, and we define a new notion of the unramified Brauer group of an algebraic stack.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result of this note asserts that a strong form of the Matroid Minor Conjecture due to J. Draisma is not true, i.e., there exist properly ascending chains of $S_\infty$-stable ideals in the affine coordinate ring of the affine infinite Grassmannian, where $S_\infty$ is the infinite symmetric group. In fact, we explicitly construct such an ascending chain. His conjectures on topological noetherian property for the affine infinite Grassmannian remain open though.</description>

      <title>Numerical invariants of normed matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a normed matrix factorization category and a notion of bounding cochains for objects of this category. We classify bounding cochains up to gauge equivalence for spherical objects and use this classification to define numerical invariants. These invariants are expected to correspond under mirror symmetry to the open Gromov-Witten invariants with only boundary constraints of Lagrangian rational cohomology spheres defined by the second author and Tukachinsky.
  For each Delzant polytope, we construct a normed matrix factorization category. For Delzant polytopes satisfying a combinatorial relative spin condition, we construct an object of this category called the Dirac factorization. The Dirac factorization is expected to correspond under mirror symmetry to the Lagrangian submanifold given by the real locus of the toric symplectic manifold associated to the Delzant polytope. In the case of the $n$-simplex for $n$ odd, we show that the Dirac factorization is spherical, mirroring the fact that $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is a rational cohomology sphere. For $n = 1,$ we show the numerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincide with the open Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{R} P^1 \subset \mathbb{C} P^1.$ For $n = 3$ in low degrees, computer calculations verify that the numerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincide with the open Gromov-Witten-Welschinger invariants of $\mathbb{R}P^3 \subset \mathbb{C} P^3.$ Although $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is trivial in the Fukaya category of $\mathbb{C} P^n$ over any field of characteristic zero, the above results can be seen as a manifestation of mirror symmetry over a Novikov ring.</description>

      <title>Bordism and resolution of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt algorithms for resolving the singularities of complex algebraic varieties to prove that the natural map of homology theories from complex bordism to the bordism theory of complex derived orbifolds splits. In equivariant stable homotopy theory, our techniques yield a splitting of homology theories for the map from bordism to the equivariant bordism theory of a finite group $\Gamma$, given by assigning to a manifold its product with $\Gamma$. In symplectic topology, and using recent work of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirshi-Swaminathan, we conclude that one can define complex cobordism-valued Gromov-Witten invariant for arbirary (closed) symplectic manifolds. We apply our results to constrain the topology of the space of Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$. The methods we develop apply to normally complex orbifolds, and will hence lead to applications in symplectic topology that rely on moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We compute the motivic Euler characteristic of Ayoub's nearby cycles spectrum in terms of strata of a semi-stable reduction, for a degeneration to multiple semi-quasi-homogeneous singularities. This allows us to compare the local picture at the singularities with the global conductor formula for hypersurfaces developed by Levine, Pepin Lehalleur and Srinivas, revealing that the formula is local in nature, thus extending it to the more general setting considered in this paper. The result is a quadratic refinement to the Milnor number formula with multiple singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss two operations on nodal curves with (logarithmic) vector fields, which resemble the `stabilization' construction in Knudsen's proof that $\bar{\mathcal M}_{g,n+1}$ is the universal curve over $\bar{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$. We prove that both operations work in families (commute with base change). We construct inverse operations under suitable assumptions, which allow us to prove a technical result quite similar to Knudsen's, in the case of curves with vector fields.
  As an application, we prove that the Losev--Manin compactification of the space of configurations of $n$ points on ${\mathbb P}^1 \backslash \{0,\infty\}$ modulo scaling degenerates isotrivially to a compactification of the space of configurations of $n$ points on ${\mathbb A}^1$ modulo translation, and the natural group actions fit together globally.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we compute the pseudo-effective cones of various projective bundles $\mathbb{P}_X(E)$ over higher dimensional varieties $X$ under some assumptions on $X$ as well as on the vector bundle $E$. We also compute the volume function on fibre product $\mathbb{P}(E)\times_C\mathbb{P}(F)$ of two projective bundles over a smooth irreducible complex projective curve $C$. In particular, we show that the volume function on the fiber product of two ruled surfaces is of polynomial type.</description>

Abstract: We construct small resolutions of the moduli space $\overline{Q}_n$ of stable scaled $n$-marked lines of Ziltener and Ma'u--Woodward and of the moduli space $\overline{P}_n$ of stable $n$-marked ${\mathbb G}_a$-rational trees introduced in earlier work. The resolution of $\overline{P}_n$ is the augmented wonderful variety corresponding to the graphic matroid of the complete graph. The resolution of $\overline{Q}_n$ is a further blowup, also a wonderful model of an arrangement in ${\mathbb P}^{n-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the image of the nonnegative orthant under the power-sum map and the elementary symmetric polynomials map. After analyzing the image in finitely many variables, we concentrate on the limit as the number of variables approaches infinity. We explain how the geometry of the limit plays a crucial role in undecidability results in nonnegativity of symmetric polynomials, deciding validity of trace inequalities in linear algebra, and extremal combinatorics - recently observed by Blekherman, Raymond, and F. Wei. We verify the experimental observation that the image has the combinatorial geometry of a cyclic polytope made by Mel\'anov\'a, Sturmfels, and Winter, and generalize results of Choi, Lam, and Reznick on nonnegative even symmetric polynomials. We also show that undecidability does not hold for the normalized power sum map.</description>

      <title>Making the motivic group structure on the endomorphisms of the projective line explicit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a group structure on the set of pointed naive homotopy classes of scheme morphisms from the Jouanolou device to the projective line. The group operation is defined via matrix multiplication on generating sections of line bundles and only requires basic algebraic geometry. In particular, it is completely independent of the construction of the motivic homotopy category. We show that a particular scheme morphism, which exhibits the Jouanolou device as an affine torsor bundle over the projective line, induces a monoid morphism from Cazanave's monoid to this group. Moreover, we show that this monoid morphism is a group completion to a subgroup of the group of scheme morphisms from the Jouanolou device to the projective line. This subgroup is generated by a set of morphisms that are simple to describe.</description>

      <title>Tropical refined curve counting with descendants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a $q$-refined tropical correspondence theorem for higher genus descendant logarithmic Gromov--Witten invariants with a $\lambda_g$ class in toric surfaces. Specifically, a generating series of such logarithmic Gromov--Witten invariants agrees with a $q$-refined count of rational tropical curves satisfying higher valency conditions. As a corollary, we obtain a geometric proof of the deformation invariance of this tropical count. In particular, our results give an algebro--geometric meaning to the tropical count defined by Blechman and Shustin. Our strategy is to use the logarithmic degeneration formula, and the key new technique is to reduce to computing integrals against double ramification cycles and connect these integrals to the non--commutative KdV hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Frobenius--stable version of the Grauert--Riemenschneider vanishing theorem fails for terminal 3-folds in characteristic $p \in \left\{2, 3, 5\right\}$. To prove this, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb{F}_p$-rationality for singularities in positive characteristic and we show that klt singularities in dimension at most 4 are $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational. We apply this to prove a Frobenius-stable version of the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem on $K$-trivial 3-folds.</description>

Abstract: We study cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties which describe the kinematic spaces of massless scattering (with or without dual conformal symmetry). Both are instances of partial flag varieties. We exhibit embeddings of the corresponding cluster algebras into cluster algebras of sufficiently large Grassmannians and show how the former is obtained from the latter by freezing certain cluster variables and deleting some cluster variables.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of relative stability conditions on triangulated categories with respect to left admissible subcategories, based on arXiv:math/0212237, and demonstrate the deformation of relative stability conditions via the deformation of gluing stability conditions in arXiv:0902.0323. The motivation for this concept stems from the discussions in arXiv:2004.04831 concerning the relationship between Bridgeland stability and the existence of the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics on line bundles.</description>

Abstract: We study the equivariant cohomology classes of torus-equivariant subvarieties of the space of matrices. For a large class of torus actions, we prove that the polynomials representing these classes (up to suitably changing signs) are covolume polynomials in the sense of Aluffi. We study the cohomology rings of complex varieties in terms of Macaulay inverse systems over $\mathbb{Z}$. As applications, we show that under certain conditions, the Macaulay dual generator is a denormalized Lorentzian polynomial in the sense of Br\"and\'en and Huh, and we give a characteristic-free extension (over $\mathbb{Z}$) of the result of Khovanskii and Pukhlikov describing the cohomology ring of toric varieties in terms of volume polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new method of constructing non-arithmetic lattices in the projective orthogonal group $\text{PO}(n,1)$ for every integer $n$ larger than one. The technique is to consider anti-holomorphic involutions on a complex arithmetic ball quotient, glue their fixed loci along geodesic subspaces, and show that the resulting metric space carries canonically the structure of a complete real hyperbolic orbifold. The volume of various of these non-arithmetic orbifolds can be explicitly calculated.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nature of exotic spheres from two novel perspectives, addressing the fundamental question: ``What makes an exotic sphere exotic?''
  First, we explore spherical T-duality in the context of $\mathrm{S}^3$-bundles over $\mathrm{S}^4$. We demonstrate that the distinct smooth structures of exotic spheres $\Sigma^7$ correspond to spherical T-dual pairs for 16 out of the 28 diffeomorphism classes of smooth structures on seven-dimensional homotopy spheres. Furthermore, we show that spherical T-dual pairs can be encoded in $\star$-diagrams. These diagrams impose equivalences that constrain their $\mathrm{S}^3$-invariant geometries.
  Second, we introduce homotopy Hopf manifolds $\Sigma^7 \times \mathrm{S}^1$ and examine their complex structures using logarithmic transformations. This analysis links their smooth structures to the algebraic and topological invariants of Fano orbifolds. Additionally, we relate these constructions to the Homological Mirror Symmetry program and propose connections to the theory of topological modular forms, aiming to unify geometric topology, elliptic cohomology, and modular forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a tensor of degree $d$ over a field $K.$ Write $prk(F)$ for the partition rank of $F$ and $\overline{prk} (F) := prk(F\otimes_K \overline{K}),$ where $\overline{K}$ is an algebraic closure of $K.$ We prove that $prk(F) \ll_{d,K} \overline{prk} (F),$ as long as $K$ is both infinite and of finite absolute transcendence degree, partially resolving a conjecture of Adiprasito, Kazhdan and Ziegler. For finite fields we prove a result which, together with results of Moshkovitz-Zhu, implies $prk(F) \ll_d \overline{prk} (F) \log(\overline{prk} (F)+1).$ This improves the state of the art bound for partition rank in terms of analytic rank. By a standard argument, we deduce similar bounds for strength of degree $d$ polynomials, as long as $char(K) &gt; d.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the mixed Poincar\'e polynomial of generic parabolic $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character varieties with coefficients in some local systems arising from the conjugacy class of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ which has a non-connected stabiliser. We give a conjectural formula that we prove to be true under the Euler specialisation. We then prove that this conjectured formula interpolates the structure coefficients of the two based rings$ \left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)),Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2),*\right)$ and $\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)), CS(\mathrm{SL}_2),\cdot\right) $ where for a group $H$, $\mathcal{C}(H)$ denotes the space of complex valued class functions on $H$, $Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2)$ denotes the basis of characteristic functions of intermediate extensions of equivariant local systems on conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ and $CS(\mathrm{SL}_2)$ the basis of characteristic functions of Lusztig's character-sheaves on $\mathrm{SL}_2$. Our result reminds us of a non-abelian Fourier transform.</description>
