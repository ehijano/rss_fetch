      <title>Probing microsecond dynamics of disperse nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces using nanometer localization precision total-internal-reflection dark-field microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles at fluid-fluid interfaces have a wide range of important applications in industry, technology and science. Questions remain about what governs adsorption dynamics and inter-particle interactions, and how mixtures -- both of different-sized particles, and particles and surfactants -- behave. I probe the dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces using high-speed total-internal-reflection dark-field (TIR-DF) microscopy, comparing gold particles of diameters 20, 40 and 80 nanometers, and investigating the effect of an added surfactant. I built a TIR-DF microscope with a spatiotemporal resolution of up to 1 nanometer at 20 microseconds, and characterized the particle motion by direct imaging for the diffusive motion within the interfacial plane, and attenuation of light scattering and in-plane motion for out-of-plane motion. The addition of surfactant was found to qualitatively alter the interaction between the particles and the interface: Adsorptions became reversible and the size trend in diffusivity was reversed (larger particles diffused faster than smaller ones). The combination of this and the rarity of adsorption events of larger particles leads me to propose size-dependent barriers to adsorption at surfactant interfaces. In addition, at surfactant interfaces, many particles' diffusive behavior changed over the course of a trajectory, indicating several different immersion states that are stable on the experimental timescale (approximately 1 second). This study shows that there remain qualitatively new dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces to be explored. These dynamics can only be resolved at a high spatial resolution, and many of them only at high imaging speed, underlining the importance of novel imaging approaches probing the barriers of achievable spatiotemporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Instabilities and turbulence in extensile swimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study low Reynolds number turbulence in a suspension of polar, extensile, self-propelled inertial swimmers. We review the bend and splay mechanisms that destabilize an ordered flock. The suspension is always unstable to bend perturbations. Using a minimal 1D model, we show that the splay-stable to splay-unstable transition occurs via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We perform high-resolution numerical simulations in 2D to study the varieties of turbulence present in this system transitioning from defect turbulence to concentration-wave turbulence depending on a single non-dimensional number, denoting the ratio of the splay-concentration wavespeed to the swimmer motility.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Structure and Dynamics in Molecular Liquids: Insights from Pressure Experiments and Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overall goal of this thesis is to investigate the connection between the dynamics and structure of molecular glass formers, by testing different scaling laws for both. The inspiration for this work is the Isomorph theory because it predicts a connection between structure and dynamics. The fundamental prediction of the Isomorph Theory is that there exist lines in the phase diagram where both structure and dynamics are invariant when presented in reduced units. The prediction of constant dynamics has been tested and confirmed experimentally several times, but the structural prediction has never been confirmed experimentally. In this thesis, we have investigated the structural prediction for liquids where the prediction of constant dynamics has been shown experimentally.</description>

      <title>Effects of multiple cycles on the resistance distance of a strand in a homogeneous polymer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the resistance distance between a pair of adjacent vertices in a phantom network generated randomly by a Monte-Carlo method depends on the existence of short cycles around it. Here we assume that phantom networks have no fixed points but their centers of mass are located at a point. The resistance distance corresponds to the mean-square deviation of the end-to-end vector along the strand connecting the adjacent vertices. We generate random networks with fixed valency $f$ but different densities of short cycles via a Metropolis method that rewires edges among four vertices chosen randomly. In the process the cycle rank is conserved. However, the densities of short cycles are determined by the rate of randomization $kT$ which appears in the acceptance ratio $\exp(-\Delta U/kT)$ of rewiring. If a strand has few short cycles around itself, the mean squared deviation of the strand is equal to $2/f$. If it is part of a short cycle, i.e., the network has a short loop which consists of a sequence of strands including the given strand itself, its resistance distance is smaller than $2/f$, while if it is not included in a cycle but adjacent to cycles, its resistance distance is larger than $2/f$. We show it via an electrical circuit analogy of the network. Moreover, we numerically show that the effect of multiple cycles on the resistance distance is expressed as a linear combination of the effects of isolated single cycles. It follows that cycles independently have an effect on the fluctuation properties of a strand in a polymer network.</description>

      <title>Compressibility of Confined Fluids from Volume Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their properties deviate from bulk. These include bulk modulus, or compressibility, which determines the mechanical properties of fluid-saturated porous solids. Such properties are of importance for exploration and recovery of coal-bed methane and shale gas. We developed a new molecular simulation method for calculating compressibility of confined fluids, and applied it to methane in carbon nanopores. The method is based on volume fluctuations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, made possible through integrated potentials. Our method is one order of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo approach, and allows calculations for pore sizes up to 100 nm. Our simulations predicted an increase in the fluid bulk modulus by a factor of 4 in 3 nm slit pores, and showed a gradual decrease with the increase of the pore size, so that at 100 nm, the deviation from the bulk is less than 5%.</description>

      <title>Nematic order from phase synchronization of shape oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a suspension of non-interacting deformable particles subjected to an oscillatory shear flow leads to development of nematic order that arises from the phenomenon of phase synchronization. The synchronized state corresponds to a unique, stable limit cycle confined in the toroidal state space. The limit cycle exists since, unlike rigid particles, deformable particles can modulate aspect ratio, adjust their tumbling rate and thus, achieve phase synchronization. These synchronized regions emerge as Arnold tongues in the parameter-space of the driving amplitude and frequency. Considering the rheological implications of ordering dynamics in soft and active matter, our results motivate oscillatory shear flow experiments with deformable particles.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic characterization via deep indentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperelastic material characterization is crucial for understanding the behavior of soft materials -- such as tissues, rubbers, hydrogels, and polymers -- under quasi-static loading before failure. Traditional methods typically rely on uniaxial tensile tests, which require the cumbersome preparation of dumbbell-shaped samples for clamping in a uniaxial testing machine. In contrast, indentation-based methods, which can be conducted \textit{in-situ} without sample preparation, have been underexplored. To characterize the hyperelastic behavior of soft materials, deep indentation is required, where the material response extends beyond linear elasticity. In this study, we perform finite element analysis to link the force ($F$) versus indentation depth ($D$) curve with the hyperelastic behavior of a soft incompressible material, using a one-term Ogden model for simplicity. We identify three indentation regimes based on the ratio between indentation depth and the radius ($R$) of the spherical-tipped cylindrical indenter: the Hertzian regime ($D &lt; 0.1R$), where $F = \frac{16}{9} E R^{0.5} D^{1.5}$; the parabolic regime ($D &gt; 10R$), where $F = E D^2 \beta$ and the indenter radius becomes irrelevant; and an intermediate regime ($0.1R &lt; D &lt; 10R$) bridging the two extremes. We find that the Ogden strain-stiffening coefficient ($\alpha$) increases the parabolic indentation coefficient ($\beta$), allowing for the estimation of $\alpha$ from $\beta$. Furthermore, we observe that Coulomb friction increases $\beta$, potentially masking the effect of strain-stiffening for small $\alpha$. However, for $\alpha &gt; 3$, friction has a negligible effect. Finally, our results show good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that deep indentation can be an effective method for extracting hyperelastic properties from soft materials through \textit{in-situ} testing.</description>

      <title>Gliding microtubules exhibit tunable collective rotation driven by chiral active forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How chirality propagates across scales remains an open question in many biological and synthetic systems. An especially clear manifestation of this propagation is found in in vitro gliding assays of cytoskeletal filaments on surfaces, driven by molecular motors. These assays have become model systems of active matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical states, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have remained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in microtubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each on two types of substrates. We propose that chirality in active forces exerted by motors on microtubules represents a viable mechanism for this large-scale chirality. Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active nematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e. shape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the angular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by modulating filament stiffness. Our findings identify a new set of sufficient microscopic ingredients for predictable propagation of chiral handedness from the molecular to the material scale in living and active matter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for $^3$He and $^4$He is considered on the basis of the Schr\"odinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.</description>

      <title>DNA Nanotechnology for Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance, first proposed by Dicke in 1954, is a highly efficient quantum light source that differs from conventional spontaneous emission. Unlike typical spontaneous emission, where intensity scales linearly with the number of electric dipoles, superradiance exhibits an intensity that scales quadratically with the number of electric dipoles. Similarly, the decay rate also increases proportionally to the dipole numbers. This collective emission is especially powerful when it manifests as superfluorescence, a physical regime of superradiance where spontaneously emerging coherence is achieved by arranging excited dipoles in the same orientation within a volume much smaller than their emission wavelength. Numerous experimental strategies have been employed to generate superradiance, with one common approach being the use of stochastically formed aggregates of quantum dots and organic dyes. However, the inherent randomness in such systems prevents precise control over the number, spatial distribution, and relative orientation of the emitters. This often leads to non-uniform coupling strengths and parasitic dephasing effects, which make it difficult to predict the resulting quantum emission and limit its use in engineered devices. A deterministic platform that provides precise control over these parameters is therefore essential for realizing the full potential of superradiant systems. Here, we (i) specifically outline the advantages of DNA nanotechnology in tackling this challenge, (ii) discuss the reasons why superradiance has not yet been realized even with the state-of-the art DNA nanotechnology, and (iii) propose potential solutions for overcoming the current limitations.</description>

      <title>Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</description>

      <title>New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model to simulate charge flow through an electrochemical half cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</description>
