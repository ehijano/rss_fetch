      <title>Connecting weakly nonlinear elasticity theories of isotropic hyperelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft materials exhibit significant nonlinear geometric deformations and stress-strain relationships under external forces. This paper explores weakly nonlinear elasticity theories, including Landau's and Murnaghan's formulations, advancing understanding beyond linear elasticity. We establish connections between these methods and extend strain-energy functions to the third and fourth orders in powers of epsilon, where epsilon is defined as the square root of the inner product of H with itself, epsilon = sqrt(H * H), and epsilon is between 0 and 1. Here, H represents the perturbation to the deformation gradient tensor, where the deformation gradient F is given by F = I + H. Furthermore, we address simplified strain-energy functions applicable to incompressible materials. Through this work, we contribute to a comprehensive understanding of nonlinear elasticity and its relationship to weakly nonlinear elasticity, facilitating the study of moderate deformations in soft material behavior and its practical applications.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Coil-Globule Transitions and Aggregation in Homopolymer Aqueous Solutions: Simulation and Topological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and topological behavior of interacting hydrophobic polymer chains in aqueous solutions by combining molecular dynamics simulations with circuit topology (CT) analysis. Combining geometric observables such as the radius of gyration and degree of aggregation with CT data we are able to capture the relationship between the coil-globule and aggregation transitions, resolving the underlying organizational changes of the system. Our results uncover a clear temperature-driven collective transition from isolated coiled polymers to aggregated globular clusters. This transition is reflected not only in conventional geometric descriptors but also in a striking reorganization of CT motifs: from dominant intrachain motifs at low temperatures to a rich ensemble of multichain motifs as temperature increases. We demonstrate that CT motif enumeration reproduces standard contact statistics via combinatorics while simultaneously providing a higher-order, topologically informed view of polymer organization. These findings highlight the power of CT as a structural descriptor for complex soft-matter systems and suggest broad applicability to biologically relevant phenomena.</description>

      <title>Stokes drag on a sphere in a three-dimensional anisotropic porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on a sphere in a static anisotropic porous medium. This problem is analysed using the Brinkman-Debye-Bueche equations with an axisymmetric shielding (or permeability) tensor. Using the exact Green's functions for this model fluid within a single-layer boundary element formulation, we numerically compute the friction tensor for a translating sphere subjected to stick boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for small anisotropy using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. By benchmarking this result against the numerical solutions, we find that a linear approximation is valid in a broad parameter regime. Our results are important for studying self-diffusion in general anisotropic porous media, but can also be applied to small tracers in nematic fluids composed of disk- or rod-like crowders.</description>

      <title>Cholic Acid-Based Mixed Micelles as siRNA Delivery Agents for Gene Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of various cancers but is hindered by the physico-chemical properties of siRNA and needs a suitable vector for the delivery of siRNA to the target tissue. Bile acid-based block copolymers offers certain advantages for the loading and delivery of siRNA since they can efficiently complex siRNA and bile acids are biocompatible endogenous molecules. In this study, we demonstrate the use of lipids as co-surfactants for the preparation of mixed micelles to improve the siRNA delivery of cholic acid-based block copolymers. Poly(allyl glycidyl ether) (PAGE) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were polymerized on the surface of cholic acid to afford a star-shaped block copolymer with four arms (CA-PAGE-b-PEG)4. The allyl groups of PAGE were functionalized to bear primary or tertiary amines and folic acid was grafted onto the PEG chain end to increase cell uptake. (CA-PAGE-b-PEG)4 functionalized with either primary or tertiary amines show high siRNA complexation with close to 100% complexation at N/P ratio of 8. Uniform aggregates with diameters between 181 and 188 nm were obtained. DOPE, DSPE-PEG2k, and DSPE-PEG5k lipids were added as co-surfactants to help stabilize the nanoparticles in the cell culture media. Mixed micelles had high siRNA loading with close to 100% functionalization at N/P ratio of 16 and diameters ranging from 153 to 221 nm. The presence of lipids in the mixed micelles improved cell uptake with a concomitant siRNA transfection in HeLa and HeLa-GFP model cells, respectively.</description>

      <title>How rigidity percolation and bending stiffness shape colloidal gel elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersed colloidal particles within a suspension can aggregate and spontaneously self-organize into a robust, percolating structure known as a gel. These network-like structures are prevalent in nature and play a critical role in many industrial processes, including those involving batteries, food products, and pharmaceutical formulations. In this paper, we examine the emergence of elasticity in colloidal gels. We show that gelation is governed by a rigidity percolation transition. We identify a characteristic correlation length that quantifies the extent of elastic and structural inhomogeneities, which diverges at the critical point. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the interaction types, the particle concentration, or the specific route to non-ergodicity i.e. the preparation protocol, the elastic moduli and vibrational properties of gels can be accurately predicted within a unifying framework, in which the bending modes of fractal clusters -- approximately the size of this correlation length -- dominate under small deformations.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Investigation of Static and Dynamic Interfacial Properties in Ice-Polymer Premelting Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Premelting at the ice-polymer interfaces, in which a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) forms below the melting point, is strongly influenced by polymer surface chemistry; however, the molecular-scale mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics simulations combined with machine learning-assisted analysis to elucidate how polymer type (hydrophilic vs hydrophobic) modulates interfacial premelting. Our simulations reveal that hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer surfaces have distinct effects on the QLL thickness, interfacial water structure, and diffusivity. Specifically, a hydrophilic polymer interface promotes a thicker QLL with more ordered interfacial water and lower diffusivity, whereas a hydrophobic interface induces a thinner QLL with a less ordered interfacial water structure and higher diffusivity. These results advance the understanding of polymer-mediated interfacial melting phenomena and offer guidance for designing anti-icing and low-friction materials.</description>

      <title>Oscillation death by mechanochemical feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are compressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</description>

      <title>TDP-43 multidomains and RNA modulate interactions and viscoelasticity in biomolecular condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA-binding proteins form biomolecular condensates with RNA through phase separation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. While intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation, additional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate formation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA and affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that interaction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key residues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA binding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by TDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate. Specifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence of polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in magnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and its RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their viscoelastic properties.</description>

      <title>Dissipative particle dynamics models of encapsulated microbubbles and gas vesicles for biomedical ultrasound simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound-guided drug and gene delivery (usdg) enables controlled and spatially precise delivery of drugs and macromolecules, encapsulated in microbubbles (embs) and submicron gas vesicles (gvs), to target areas such as cancer tumors. It is a non-invasive, high precision, low toxicity process with drastically reduced drug dosage. Rheological and acoustic properties of gvs and embs critically affect the outcome of usdg and imaging. Detailed understanding and modeling of their physical properties is thus essential for ultrasound-mediated therapeutic applications. State-of-the-art continuuum models of shelled bodies cannot incorporate critical details such as varying thickness of the encapsulating shell or specific interactions between its constituents and interior or exterior solvents. Such modeling approaches also do not allow for detailed modeling of chemical surface functionalizations, which are crucial for tuning the gv-blood interactions. We develop a general particle-based modeling framework for encapsulated bodies that accurately captures elastic and rheological properties of gvs and embs. We use dissipative particle dynamics to model the solvent, the gaseous phase in the capsid, and the triangulated surfaces of immersed objects. Their elastic behavior is studied and validated through stretching and buckling simulations, eigenmode analysis, shear flow simulations, and comparison of predicted gv buckling pressure with experimental data from the literature. The presented modeling approach paves the way for large-scale simulations of encapsulated bodies, capturing their dynamics, interactions, and collective behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-reinforcement is a universal feature of many biological tissues. It involves the interplay between fiber stiffness, fiber orientation, and the elastic properties of the matrix, influencing pattern formation and evolution in layered tissues. Here, we investigate the deformation of a compressed film bonded to a half-space, where either the film or the substrate exhibits anisotropy. Within the framework of finite elasticity, we formulate nonlinear incremental equations, enabling linear and weakly nonlinear analyses. These analyses yield exact bifurcation conditions and an amplitude equation for surface wrinkling. In particular, for a simple fiber-reinforced model, we show that the bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical depending on the ratio between the substrate and the film moduli. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fiber-reinforcement in shaping pattern formation in anisotropic tissues and provide insights into the morphological evolution of biological tissues.</description>

      <title>True Solid-State Electrical Conduction of Proteins shows them to be Efficient Transport Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While solid-state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over lengths that surpass those of conventional organic semiconducting systems, interfacial or contact effects may obscure the intrinsic protein charge transport properties. Therefore, contact resistance (RC) effects need to be quantified and then minimized, which poses a problem if 4-probe geometries cannot be used. Here we show how RC can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero-length resistance (RZLR) and short-circuit resistance (RS). We used AC (impedance spectroscopy) and DC measurements to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si-Au, Au-EGaIn, and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au-Pd, were compared. While Si-Au and Au-EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC that we ascribe to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein-electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (beta) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC, exceptionally low beta values (0.7 to 1.1 per nm) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Molecular Determinants of Orthosteric-allosteric Dual Inhibition of PfHT1 by Computational Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome antimalarial drug resistance, carbohydrate derivatives as selective PfHT1 inhibitor have been suggested in recent experimental work with orthosteric and allosteric dual binding pockets. Inspired by this promising therapeutic strategy, herein, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the molecular determinants of co-administration on orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors targeting PfHT1. Our binding free energy analysis capture the essential trend of inhibitor binding affinity to protein from published experimental IC50 data in three sets of distinct characteristics. In particular, we rank the contribution of key residues as binding sites which categorized into three groups based on linker length, size of tail group, and sugar moiety of inhibitors. The pivotal roles of these key residues are further validated by mutant analysis where mutated to nonpolar alanine leading to reduced affinities to different degrees. The exception was fructose derivative, which exhibited a significant enhanced affinity to mutation on orthosteric sites due to strong changed binding poses. This study may provide useful information for optimized design of precision medicine to circumvent drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites with high efficacy.</description>

      <title>Integer Lattice Gas with a sampling collision operator for the fluctuating Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While lattice Boltzmann methods were originally derived as the Boltzmann limit of a Boolean lattice gas, modern improvements to lattice Boltzmann methods have broken this link. Because of this most lattice Boltzmann methods are not unconditionally stable and extending them to model fluctuations is challenging. In this article we show that the integer lattice gas method developed by Blommel and Wagner has a lattice Boltzmann limit corresponding to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods, while also recovering proper ideal gas equilibrium fluctuations. We also show that it is possible to accelerate these integer lattice gases such that they become computationally competitive with the corresponding lattice Boltzmann method.</description>

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.</description>

      <title>Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.</description>

      <title>Predicting neutron experiments from first principles: A workflow powered by machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in materials discovery, enabling the rapid design of novel materials with tailored properties for countless applications, including in the context of energy and sustainability. To ensure the reliability of these methods, however, rigorous validation against experimental data is essential. Scattering techniques -- using neutrons, X-rays, or electrons -- offer a direct way to probe atomic-scale structure and dynamics, making them ideal for this purpose. In this work, we describe a computational workflow that bridges machine learning-based simulations with experimental validation. The workflow combines density functional theory, machine-learned interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics, and autocorrelation function analysis to simulate experimental signatures, with a focus on inelastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate the approach on three representative systems: crystalline silicon, crystalline benzene, and hydrogenated scandium-doped BaTiO3, comparing the simulated spectra to measurements from four different neutron spectrometers. While our primary focus is inelastic neutron scattering, the workflow is readily extendable to other modalities, including diffraction and quasi-elastic scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and electrons. The good agreement between simulated and experimental results highlights the potential of this approach for guiding and interpreting experiments, while also pointing out areas for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric and Hyper Dielectric modes in Ferronematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary mixtures of the ferronematic compound DIO with recently reported non-ferroelectric material WJ-16 which shows Colossal Permittivity (CP) ~5000 and superparaelectricity (SPE) were studied by POM, electrical switching studies, and dielectric spectroscopy. Three mixtures with different contents of WJ-16 as 10, 25 and 50% in DIO as host were prepared. Our original expectation was the development of new nematic materials with both ferroelectric nematic (NF) and non-ferroelectric CP phases. The non-ferroelectric phase in mixtures exhibits a CP mode originally observed in pure WJ-16 and was termed as superparaelectric. However, the dielectric spectroscopy of mixtures shows two distinct relaxation processes: the typical paraelectric response and the CP mode. Therefore, this CP mode cannot be called superparaelectric and is redefined it as Hyper Dielectric mode. This is the first direct demonstration of materials with both ferroelectric and Hyper-dielectric phases in liquid crystalline materials. The hyper dielectric phase has a good potential as a working media for supercapacitors industry.</description>

      <title>The Diffuse Solid Method for Wetting and Multiphase Fluid Simulations in Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a diffuse solid method that is versatile and accurate for modeling wetting and multiphase flows in highly complex geometries. In this scheme, we harness N + 1-component phase field models to investigate interface shapes and flow dynamics of N fluid components, and we optimize how to constrain the evolution of the component employed as the solid phase to conform to any pre-defined geometry. Implementations for phase field energy minimization and lattice Boltzmann method are presented. Our approach does not need special treatment for the fluid-solid wetting boundary condition, which makes it simple to implement. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we employ the diffuse solid method to explore wide-ranging examples, including droplet contact angle on a flat surface, particle adsorption on a fluid-fluid interface, critical pressure on micropillars and on Salvinia leaf structures, capillary rise against gravity, Lucas-Washburn's law for capillary filling, and droplet motion on a sinusoidally undulated surface. Our proposed approach can be beneficial to computationally study multiphase fluid interactions with textured solid surfaces that are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a generalized law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts possibly to a critical area density along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can provide a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle Formation for the Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic structure and dynamics of shear-thinning suspensions of polydisperse, repulsive vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the rheology, microscopic structure, and dynamics of an industrially relevant dispersion made of cationic surfactant vesicles, from dilute to concentrated conditions. We find that these suspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively low concentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-defined transition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak in the static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down and develop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. This low-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light of experiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar composition the interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to propose that the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as an entropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled to crowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as the nonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow. Our work suggests that similar effects might be a generic feature of dense, highly polydisperse charged suspensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to an energetic landscape that defines three species: two distinct states of particles with a finite size, and point particles as an intermediate state between the two previous species. We show that the non-equilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</description>

      <title>Curvature-sensing and generation by membrane proteins: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding are reviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Optimal Mixing via Defect-Vortex Coupling in Confined Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active nematic flows in two dimensions, largely driven by motile $+1/2$ disclinations, mix themselves efficiently and exhibit chaos in the bulk steady state. Motivated by recent experimental findings for three-defect braiding in cardioid-shaped domains, we investigate how this tendency toward chaotic fluid mixing can, counterintuitively, produce certain ordered, periodic flows in confinement with a controllable net topological charge. We study two-dimensional active nematics in systems with boundary conditions requiring a prescribed number of excess $+1/2$ disclinations, using Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics simulations, alongside an agent-based, hydrodynamic simulation approach. We find ordered flows for systems of three and four defects, and we use tools from braid theory to show that spontaneously occurring periodic defect motions produce maximal topological entropy. Our theory correctly predicts the generic absence of stable periodic orbits of more than four defects in strong confinement in simulation. Our results identify the parameter regime outside of which periodicity is lost, and allow us to probe the limits of topological entropy production.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic detection of crystal structures from computer simulation data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas, along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of condensed matter physics and computational materials science.</description>

      <title>Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</description>
