      <title>Can Ephapticity Contributes to the Brain Complexity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inquiry into the origin of brain complexity remains a pivotal question in neuroscience. While synaptic stimuli are acknowledged as significant, their efficacy often falls short in elucidating the extensive interconnections of the brain and nuanced levels of cognitive integration. Recent advances in neuroscience have brought the mechanisms underlying the generation of highly intricate dynamics, emergent patterns, and sophisticated oscillatory signals into question. Within this context, our study, in alignment with current research, posits the hypothesis that ephaptic communication may emerge as the primary candidate for unraveling optimal brain complexity. In this investigation, we conducted a comparative analysis between two types of networks utilizing the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Ephaptic model (QIF-E): (I) a small-world synaptic network (ephaptic-off) and (II) a mixed composite network comprising a small-world synaptic network with the addition of an ephaptic network (ephaptic-on). Utilizing the Multiscale Entropy methodology, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the responses generated by both network configurations, with complexity assessed by integrating across all temporal scales. Our findings demonstrate that ephaptic coupling enhances complexity under specific topological conditions, considering variables such as time, spatial scales, and synaptic intensity. These results offer fresh insights into the dynamics of communication within the nervous system and underscore the fundamental role of ephapticity in regulating complex brain functions.</description>

      <title>Simple Network Mechanism Leads to Quasi-Real Brain Activation Patterns with Drosophila Connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the high computational demands of most methods, using network communication models to simulate the brain is a more economical way. However, despite numerous brain network communication models, there is still insufficient evidence that they can effectively replicate the real activation patterns of the brain. Moreover, it remains unclear whether actual network structures are crucial in simulating intelligence. Addressing these issues, we propose a large scale network communication model based on simple rules and design criteria to assess the differences between network models and real situations. We conduct research on the biggest adult Drosophila connectome data set. Experimental results show significant activation in neurons that should respond to stimulus and slight activation in irrelevant ones, which we call quasi-real activation pattern. Besides, when we change the network structure, the quasi-activation patterns disappear. Interestingly, activation regions have shorter network distances to their input neurons, implying that the network structure (not spatial distance) is the core to form brain functionality. In addition, giving the input neurons a unilateral stimulus, we observe a bilateral response, which is consistent with reality. Then we find that both hemispheres have extremely similar statistical indicators. We also develop real-time 3D large spatial network visualization software to observe and document experimental phenomena, filling the software gap. This research reveals network models' power: it can reach the quasi-activation pattern even with simple propagation rules. Besides, it provides evidence that network structure matters in brain activity pattern generation. Future research could fully simulate brain behavior through network models, paving the way for artificial intelligence by developing new propagation rules and optimizing link weights.</description>

      <title>Joint covariance properties under geometric image transformations for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The influence of natural image transformations on receptive field responses is crucial for modelling visual operations in computer vision and biological vision. In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels.
  This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels.
  The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature.
  The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</description>
