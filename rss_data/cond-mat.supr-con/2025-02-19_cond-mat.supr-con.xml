      <title>Quantum geometric photocurrents of quasiparticles in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical response is a sensitive probe of the geometry and symmetry of electronic Bloch states in solids. Here, we extend this notion to the Bogoliubiov-de-Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles in superconductors. We present a theory of photocurrents in superconductors and show that they sensitively depend on the quantum geometry of the BdG excitation spectrum. For all light polarizations, the photocurrent is proportional to the quantum geometric tensor: for linear polarized light it is related to the quantum metric and for circular polarization -- the Berry curvature dipole of the associated BdG bands. We further relate the photocurrent to the ground state symmetries, providing a symmetry dictionary for the allowed photocurrent responses. For light not at normal incidence to the sample, photocurrent probes time-reversal symmetry breaking in systems with chiral point groups (such as twisted bilayers). We demonstrate that photocurrents allow to probe topology and TRS breaking in twisted $d$-wave superconductors and test the nature of superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ and multilayer stacks of rhombohedral graphene. Our results pave the way to contactless measurement of the quantum geometric properties and symmetry of superconductivity in materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Normal State and Pressure-driven Reentrant Superconductivity in the Heavy $d$-electron Superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity beyond the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) framework often emerges out of a normal state that is accompanied by exotic magnetism and thereby displays many exceptional transport and thermodynamic properties. Here we report that the normal state of the heavy $d$-electron superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ is characterized by a weak \textit{ferromagnetism} that persists up to room temperature. We show that the broad hump in its resistivity likely results from the Kondo interaction of the conduction electrons with this novel magnetism. By applying pressure, superconductivity is fully suppressed first. In the high-pressure regime, however, we observe a second dome of superconductivity with its maximum $T_c$ greater than the ambient pressure value, highlighting the possible \textit{unconventional} superconductivity in this heavy $d$-electron sulfide.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to fault tolerant quantum computation using topological qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Unprecedentedly large gap in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ with the highest $T_c$ at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cuprate superconductors, the highest $T_c$ is possessed by the HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) system at ambient pressure, but the reason remains elusive. Here we report the scanning tunneling measurements on the Hg-1223 single crystals with $T_c$ = 134 K. The observed gaps determined from the tunneling spectra (STS) can be categorized into two groups: the smaller gap $\Delta_1$ ranges from about 45 to 70 meV, while the larger gap $\Delta_2$ from about 65 to 98 meV. The STS was measured up to 200 K and the larger gap can persist well above $T_c$, indicating a pseudogap feature which may reflect the strong pairing energy in the inner layer. Interestingly, an extremely strong particle-hole asymmetry is observed in associating with a very robust coherence-like peak at the bias of the larger gap in the hole branch of the Bogoliubov dispersion. We argue that the observed asymmetry results may be from the interplay of a flat band (van Hove singularity) in the electronic spectrum and the large gap in the underdoped (inner) layer. A theoretical approach based on a trilayer model with an interlayer coupling can give a reasonable explanation. Our results provide deep insight into understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Pressure-enhanced spin-density-wave transition in double-layer nickelate $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a signature of high-temperature superconductivity above the liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) was reported for $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$ under pressure. This finding immediately stimulated intense interest in the possible mechanism of high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity in double-layer nickelates. Notably, the pressure-dependent phase diagram inferred from transport measurements indicates that the superconductivity under high pressure emerges from the suppression of density-wave-like order at ambient pressure, which is similar to high-temperature superconductors. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of $^{139}La$ nuclei was performed to study the density-wave-like transition in a single crystal of $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$. At high temperatures, two sets of sharp $^{139}La$ NMR peaks are clearly distinguishable from a broad background signals, which are ascribed to La(1) sites from two bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper phases with different oxygen vacancy ${\delta}$. As the temperature decreases, the temperature-dependent $^{139}La$ NMR spectra and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $(1/T_{1}$) for both La(1) sites provide evidence of spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering below the transition temperature ($T_{SDW}$), which is ~ 150 K. The anisotropic splitting in the NMR spectra suggests the formation of a possible double spin stripe with magnetic moments aligned along the c-axis. Furthermore, we studied the pressure-dependent SDW transition up to ~ 2.7 GPa. Surprisingly, the $T_{SDW}$ inferred from NMR measurements of both La(1) sites increases with increasing pressure, which is opposite to the results from previous transport measurements under pressure and suggests an intriguing phase diagram between superconductivity and SDW. All these results will be helpful for building a connection between superconductivity and magnetic interactions in double-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Light-driven interlayer propagation of collective-mode excitations in layered superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit a nonlinear interaction with an applied light, which can resonantly excite the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode. Here we study light-induced dynamics of layered superconductors, where each layer is coupled to adjacent layers via the Josephson coupling and the first few layers near the surface are driven by an in-plane-polarized light. We study the system under the assumption that the interlayer Coulomb interactions are sufficiently screened out and that the phase-difference mode becomes available in the low-energy regime. We find that interlayer transport is induced via excitations of the collective amplitude and phase-difference modes, even when the applied electric field is parallel to the planes. We provide analytic calculations as well as numerical simulations of the real-time dynamics, and investigate the influence on the light-induced interlayer Josephson current and intralayer third-harmonic generation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Spin-stripe order tied to the pseudogap phase in La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although spin and charge stripes in high-Tc cuprates have been extensively studied, the exact range of carrier concentration over which they form a static order remains uncertain, complicating efforts to understand their significance. In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) and in zero external magnetic field, static spin stripes are confined to a doping range well below p*, the pseudogap boundary at zero temperature. However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of superconductivity, spin stripe order is found to extend up to p*. Here, we investigated La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) using 139La nuclear magnetic resonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar competition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless, we find that static spin stripes are present practically up to p* irrespective of field strength: the stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents superconductivity from enforcing a non-magnetic ground state, except very close to p*. Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by p* in both LSCO and Eu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and superconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins and charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the pseudogap phase, though the exact nature of this connection has yet to be elucidated. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a different nature: either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both fluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static. The presence of spin-stripe order up to p*, the pervasive, slow, and field-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic inhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in discussions of Fermi surface transformations, quantum criticality, and strange metal behavior.</description>

      <title>Transport Signatures of Radial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling at Ferromagnet/Superconductor Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerging at the interfaces of superconducting magnetic tunnel junctions is at the heart of multiple unprecedented physical phenomena, covering triplet proximity effects induced by unconventional (spin-flip) Andreev reflections, giant transport magnetoanisotropies, sizable tunneling anomalous Hall effects, and electrically controlled current-reversing $ 0 $--$ \pi $(-like) transitions in Josephson contacts. Recent first-principles calculations proposed that the Rashba spin-orbit fields in twisted graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide and van der Waals multilayers can -- owing to broken mirror symmetries -- exhibit an unconventional radial component (with spin parallel to the electron's momentum), which can be quantified by the Rashba angle $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $. We theoretically explore the ramifications of radial Rashba SOC at the interfaces of vertical ferromagnet/superconductor tunnel junctions with a focus on the magnetoanisotropies of the tunneling and tunneling-anomalous-Hall-effect conductances. Our results demonstrate that $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $ can be experimentally extracted from respective magnetization-angle shifts, providing a robust way to probe the radial Rashba SOC induced by twisted multilayers that are placed as tunneling barriers between ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes.</description>

Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</description>

      <title>The hybrid Josephson rhombus: A superconducting element with tailored current-phase relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the current-phase relation (CPR) of Josephson elements is essential for tailoring the eigenstates of superconducting qubits, tuning the properties of parametric amplifiers, and designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices. Here, we introduce the hybrid Josephson rhombus, a highly tunable superconducting circuit containing four semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions embedded in a loop. Combining magnetic frustration with gate-voltage-controlled tuning of individual Josephson couplings provides deterministic control of the harmonic content of the rhombus CPR. We show that for balanced Josephson couplings at full frustration, the hybrid rhombus displays a $\pi$-periodic $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential, indicating coherent charge-$4e$ transport. Tuning away from the balanced configuration, we observe a superconducting diode effect with efficiency exceeding 25%. These results showcase the potential of hybrid Josephson rhombi as fundamental building blocks for noise-resilient qubits and quantum devices with custom transport properties.</description>

Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.</description>
