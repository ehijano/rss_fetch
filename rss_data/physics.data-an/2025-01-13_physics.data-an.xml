      <title>Automatizing the search for mass resonances using BumpNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for resonant mass bumps in invariant-mass distributions remains a cornerstone strategy for uncovering Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Traditional methods often rely on predefined functional forms and exhaustive computational and human resources, limiting the scope of tested final states and selections. This work presents BumpNet, a machine learning-based approach leveraging advanced neural network architectures to generalize and enhance the Data-Directed Paradigm (DDP) for resonance searches. Trained on a diverse dataset of smoothly-falling analytical functions and realistic simulated data, BumpNet efficiently predicts statistical significance distributions across varying histogram configurations, including those derived from LHC-like conditions. The network's performance is validated against idealized likelihood ratio-based tests, showing minimal bias and strong sensitivity in detecting mass bumps across a range of scenarios. Additionally, BumpNet's application to realistic BSM scenarios highlights its capability to identify subtle signals while managing the look-elsewhere effect. These results underscore BumpNet's potential to expand the reach of resonance searches, paving the way for more comprehensive explorations of LHC data in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of phase transitions with minimal examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past several years, there have been many studies demonstrating the ability of neural networks and deep learning methods to identify phase transitions in many physical systems, notably in classical statistical physics systems. One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ behave analogously to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model, when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\infty$ only. We apply histogram reweighting to the neural network prediction and compare its capabilities when trained more conventionally at multiple temperatures. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\nu$, while the extraction of $\gamma$ becomes more challenging.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Weight Window Techniques for Time-Dependent Monte Carlo Neutronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient variance reduction of Monte Carlo simulations is desirable to avoid wasting computational resources. This paper presents an automated weight window algorithm for solving time-dependent particle transport problems. The weight window centers are defined by a hybrid forward solution of the discretized low-order second moment (LOSM) problem. The second-moment (SM) functionals defining the closure for the LOSM equations are computed by Monte Carlo solution. A filtering algorithm is applied to reduce noise in the SM functionals. The LOSM equations are discretized with first- and second-order time integration methods. We present numerical results of the AZURV1 benchmark. The hybrid weight windows lead to a uniform distribution of Monte Carlo particles in space. This causes a more accurate resolution of wave fronts and regions with relatively low flux.</description>

      <title>A meshless method to compute the proper orthogonal decomposition and its variants from scattered data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex phenomena can be better understood when broken down into a limited number of simpler "components". Linear statistical methods such as the principal component analysis and its variants are widely used across various fields of applied science to identify and rank these components based on the variance they represent in the data. These methods can be seen as factorisations of the matrix collecting all the data, assuming it consists of time series sampled from fixed points in space. However, when data sampling locations vary over time, as with mobile monitoring stations in meteorology and oceanography or with particle tracking velocimetry in experimental fluid dynamics, advanced interpolation techniques are required to project the data onto a fixed grid before the factorisation. This interpolation is often expensive and inaccurate. This work proposes a method to decompose scattered data without interpolating. The approach employs physics-constrained radial basis function regression to compute inner products in space and time. The method provides an analytical and mesh-independent decomposition in space and time, demonstrating higher accuracy. Our approach allows distilling the most relevant "components" even for measurements whose natural output is a distribution of data scattered in space and time, maintaining high accuracy and mesh independence.</description>

      <title>Flexible inference in heterogeneous and attributed multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networked datasets can be enriched by different types of information about individual nodes or edges. However, most existing methods for analyzing such datasets struggle to handle the complexity of heterogeneous data, often requiring substantial model-specific analysis. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic generative model to perform inference in multilayer networks with arbitrary types of information. Our approach employs a Bayesian framework combined with the Laplace matching technique to ease interpretation of inferred parameters. Furthermore, the algorithmic implementation relies on automatic differentiation, avoiding the need for explicit derivations. This makes our model scalable and flexible to adapt to any combination of input data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting overlapping community structures and performing various prediction tasks on heterogeneous multilayer data, where nodes and edges have different types of attributes. Additionally, we showcase its ability to unveil a variety of patterns in a social support network among villagers in rural India by effectively utilizing all input information in a meaningful way.</description>
