      <title>cAItomorph: Transformer-Based Hematological Malignancy Prediction from Peripheral Blood Smears in a Real-Word Cohort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peripheral blood smears remain a cornerstone in the diagnosis of hematological neoplasms, offering rapid and valuable insights that inform subsequent diagnostic steps. However, since neoplastic transformations typically arise in the bone marrow, they may not manifest as detectable aberrations in peripheral blood, presenting a diagnostic challenge. In this paper, we introduce cAItomorph, an explainable transformer-based AI model, trained to classify hematological malignancies based on peripheral blood cytomorphology. Our data comprises peripheral blood single-cell images from 6115 patients with diagnoses confirmed by cytomorphology, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and immunophenotyping from bone marrow samples, and 495 healthy controls, categorized into 22 detailed and 7 coarse classes. cAItomorph leverages the DinoBloom hematology foundation model and aggregates image encodings via a transformer-based architecture into a single vector. It achieves an overall accuracy of 68$\pm$1% (mean$\pm$s.d., 5-fold cross-validation) in 7-disease classification, with F1 scores of 74$\pm$2% for acute leukemia, 75$\pm$3% for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 82$\pm$3% for no malignancy cases. The overall accuracy increases to 84$\pm$1% in top-2 predictions. By analyzing multi-head attentions, we demonstrate clinically relevant cell-level attentions and pixel-level heatmaps. Moreover, our model's calibrated prediction probabilities reduced the false discovery rate from 13.8% to 12% without missing any acute leukemia cases, thereby decreasing the number of unnecessary bone marrow aspirations. Our code, test data, and model weights are publicly available to ensure reproducibility. This study highlights the potential of AI-assisted diagnostics in hematological malignancies, illustrating how models trained on real-world data could enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce invasive procedures.</description>

      <title>Detecting disease progression from animal movement using hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding disease dynamics is crucial for managing wildlife populations and assessing spillover risk to domestic animals and humans, but infection data on free-ranging animals are difficult to obtain. Because pathogen and parasite infections can alter host movement, infection status may be inferred from animal trajectories. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework that links observed movement behaviors to unobserved infection states, consistent with epidemiological compartmental models (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered, dead). Using movement data from 84 reintroduced scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), 38 confirmed dead in the field and 6 sampled for disease testing, we demonstrate how HMMs can incorporate epidemiological structure through (1) constrained transition probabilities (e.g., to preclude or allow recovery), (2) covariate effects on transmission, and (3) hierarchically structured HMMs (HHMMs) for multi-scale transitions. Comparing veterinary diagnostic reports with model outputs, we found that HMMs with epidemiological constraints successfully identified infection-associated reductions in movement, whereas unconstrained models failed to capture disease progression. Simulations further showed that constrained HMMs accurately classified susceptible, infected, and recovered states. By illustrating flexible formulations and a workflow for model selection, we provide a transferable approach for detecting infection from movement data. This framework can enhance wildlife disease surveillance, guide population management, and improve understanding of disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm for Navigating Synthesizable Molecular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.</description>

      <title>Detecting gene-environment interactions to guide personalized intervention: boosting distributional regression for polygenic scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polygenic risk scores can be used to model the individual genetic liability for human traits. Current methods primarily focus on modeling the mean of a phenotype neglecting the variance. However, genetic variants associated with phenotypic variance can provide important insights to gene-environment interaction studies. To overcome this, we propose snpboostlss, a cyclical gradient boosting algorithm for a Gaussian location-scale model to jointly derive sparse polygenic models for both the mean and the variance of a quantitative phenotype. To improve computational efficiency on high-dimensional and large-scale genotype data (large n and large p), we only consider a batch of most relevant variants in each boosting step. We investigate the effect of statins therapy (the environmental factor) on low-density lipoprotein in the UK Biobank cohort using the new snpboostlss algorithm. We are able to verify the interaction between statins usage and the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance in both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses. Particularly, following the spirit of target trial emulation, we observe that the treatment effect of statins is more substantial in people with higher polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance, indicating gene-environment interaction. When applying to body mass index, the newly constructed polygenic risk scores for variance show significant interaction with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Therefore, the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance derived by snpboostlss have potential to identify individuals that could benefit more from environmental changes (e.g. medical intervention and lifestyle changes).</description>

      <title>Not All Accuracy Is Equal: Prioritizing Diversity in Infectious Disease Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasts have become a cornerstone of large-scale disease response, underpinning decision making at agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their growing use reflects the goal of combining multiple models to improve accuracy and stability versus using a single model. However, recent experience shows these benefits are not guaranteed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC's multi-model forecasting ensemble outperformed the best single model by only 1%, and CDC flu forecasting ensembles have often ranked below multiple individual models.
  This raises a key question: why are ensembles underperforming? We posit that a central reason is that both model developers and ensemble builders typically focus on stand-alone accuracy. Models are fit to minimize their own forecasting error, and ensembles are often weighted according to those same scores. However, most epidemic forecasts are built from a small set of approaches and trained on the same surveillance data, leading to highly correlated errors. This redundancy limits the benefit of ensembling and may explain why large ensembles sometimes deliver only marginal gains.
  To realize the potential of ensembles, both modelers and ensemblers should prioritize models that contribute complementary information rather than replicating existing approaches. Ensembles built with this principle in mind move beyond size for its own sake toward true diversity, producing forecasts that are more robust and more valuable for epidemic preparedness and response.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Neural Networks for Windkessel Parameter Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.</description>

      <title>SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</description>

      <title>Multimodal AI predicts clinical outcomes of drug combinations from preclinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations, reducing late-stage clinical failures, and accelerating the development of precision therapies. Current AI models rely on structural or target-based features but fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically relevant predictions. Here, we introduce Madrigal, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug-combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21,842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. Madrigal uses an attention bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference, a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions, and ablations show both modality alignment and multimodality are necessary. It captures transporter-mediated interactions and aligns with head-to-head clinical trial differences for neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and hypoglycemia. In type 2 diabetes and MASH, Madrigal supports polypharmacy decisions and prioritizes resmetirom among safer candidates. Extending to personalization, Madrigal improves patient-level adverse-event prediction in a longitudinal EHR cohort and an independent oncology cohort, and predicts ex vivo efficacy in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models. Madrigal links preclinical multimodal readouts to safety risks of drug combinations and offers a generalizable foundation for safer combination design.</description>
