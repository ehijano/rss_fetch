      <title>The Identification of Two JWST/NIRCam-Dark Starburst Galaxies at $z=6.6$ with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze two dusty star-forming galaxies at $z=6.6$. These galaxies are selected from the ASPIRE survey, a JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program targeting 25 quasars and their environments at $z\simeq6.5 - 6.8$. These galaxies are identified as companions to UV-luminous quasars and robustly detected in ALMA continuum and [C II] emission, yet they are extraordinarily faint at the NIRCam wavelengths (down to $&gt;28.0$ AB mag in the F356W band). They are more obscured than galaxies like Arp220, and thus we refer to them as "NIRCam-dark" starburst galaxies (star formation rate $\simeq 80 - 250\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). Such galaxies are typically missed by (sub)-millimeter blank-field surveys. From the star-formation history (SFH), we show that the NIRCam-dark galaxies are viable progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim4$ and descendants of UV-luminous galaxies at $z&gt;10$. Although it is hard to constrain their number density from a quasar survey, we conclude that NIRCam-dark galaxies can be as abundant as $n\sim10^{-5.5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ assuming a light halo occupation model. If true, this would equal to $\sim$30% of the number densities of both the quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim4$ and UV-luminous galaxies at $z&gt;10$. We further predict that analogs at $z\sim8$ should exist according to the SFH of early massive quiescent galaxies. However, they may fall below the current detection limits of wide JWST and ALMA surveys, thus remaining "JWST-dark". To fully trace the evolution of massive galaxies and dust-obscured cosmic star formation at $z\gtrsim8$, wide-field JWST/NIRCam imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys of early protoclusters are essential.</description>

      <title>Pavo: Stellar feedback in action in a low-mass dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy, Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in archival HI single dish data. Based on the latest distance measurement ($2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc), we measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.</description>

      <title>Distinct origins of environmentally quenched galaxies in the core and outer virialised regions of massive clusters at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z\sim1$) galaxy clusters are the domain where environmental quenching mechanisms are expected to emerge as important factors in the evolution of the quiescent galaxy population. Uncovering these initially subtle effects requires exploring multiple dependencies of quenching across the cluster environment, and through time. We analyse the stellar-mass functions (SMFs) of 17 galaxy clusters within the GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys between $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5$, and with $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}&gt;9.5$. The data are fit simultaneously with a Bayesian model that allows the Schechter function parameters of the quiescent and star-forming populations to vary smoothly with cluster-centric radius and redshift. The model also fits the radial galaxy number density profile of each population, allowing the global quenched fraction to be parameterised as a function of redshift and cluster velocity dispersion. We find the star-forming SMF to not depend on radius or redshift. For the quiescent population however, there is $\sim2\sigma$ evidence for a radial dependence. Outside the cluster core ($R&gt;0.3\,R_{\rm200}$), the quenched fraction above $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}=9.5$ is $\sim40{\rm\;per\,cent}$, and the quiescent SMF is similar in shape to the star-forming field. In contrast, the cluster core has an elevated quenched fraction ($\sim70{\rm\;per\,cent}$), and a quiescent SMF similar in shape to the quiescent field population. We explore contributions of 'early mass-quenching' and mass-independent 'environmental-quenching' models in each of these radial regimes. The core is well-described primarily by early mass-quenching, which we interpret as accelerated quenching of massive galaxies in protoclusters, possibly through merger-driven feedback mechanisms. The non-core is better described through mass-independent, environmental-quenching of the infalling field population.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Spatial Distribution of Fast Radio Bursts within their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep optical and near-infrared observations of the host galaxies of 34 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient (CRAFT) survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) to compare the locations of FRBs relative to their host light distributions. Incorporating three additional FRBs from the literature, for a total of four repeating and 33 apparently non-repeating FRBs, we determine their projected galactocentric offsets and find a median of $ 4.2^{+5.7}_{-2.5}$ kpc ($1.0^{+1.5}_{-0.6}r_e$). We model their host surface brightness profiles and develop synthetic spatial distributions of their globular clusters based on host properties. We calculate the likelihood the observed location of each FRB is consistent with the smooth light of its host galaxy, residual (primarily spiral) substructure, or globular cluster distributions. The majority of FRBs favor locations within the disks of their galaxies, while only 7-13\% favor a globular cluster origin, primarily those with galactocentric offsets $\gtrsim3r_e$. At $z&lt;0.15$, where spiral structure is apparent in 86\% of our sample of FRB hosts, we find $\approx 20-46\%$ of FRBs favor an association with spiral arms. Assuming FRBs derive from magnetars, our results support multiple formation channels with the majority of progenitors associated with massive stars and a minority formed through dynamical channels. However, the moderate fraction of FRBs associated with spiral structure indicates that high star formation efficiency of the youngest and most massive stars is not a predominant driver in the production of FRB progenitors.</description>

      <title>From Voids to Clusters: Mergers and Evolutionary Pathways of Star-Forming and Quenched Low-Mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of low-mass galaxies is shaped by both internal processes and environmental factors, yet the role of environment and mergers in regulating their growth and star formation rates remains poorly understood, especially in the low-density regime. This study aims to compare the evolutionary pathways and merger histories of star-forming and quenched galaxies in dense (cluster) and under-dense (void) environments, focusing on galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{8.5} \leq M_\star/M_\odot \leq 10^{10.5}$. It presents the first statistical analysis within this stellar mass range, explicitly distinguishing between mini, minor, and major mergers across varying environments. Using the high-resolution TNG300-1 simulation from the IllustrisTNG project, we classify galaxies as star-forming and quenched based on sSFR and UVJ criteria. We track their physical properties over the last $\sim 11.5$ Gyr ($z &lt; 3$), follow their complete merger histories, distinguishing between major, minor, and mini mergers, and assess the statistical impact of these mergers on star formation, gas content, and the mass assembly of their supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Echo mapping of the black hole accretion flow in NGC 7469</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping (RM) can measure black hole accretion disc sizes and radial structure through observed time lags that should increase with wavelength as $\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$. Our 250-day RM campaign on NGC 7469 combines sub-day cadence 7-band photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory robotic telescopes and weekly X-ray and UVOT data from Swift. By fitting these light curves, we measure the spectral energy distribution of the variable accretion disc and inter-band lags of just 1.5 days across the UV to the optical range. The disc SED is close to the expected $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$, and the lags are consistent with $\tau\propto \lambda^{4/3}$, but three times larger than expected. We consider several possible modifications to standard disc assumptions. First, for a $9\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ black hole and 2 possible spins $a^\star=(0,1)$, we fit the X-ray-UV-optical SED with a compact relativistic corona at height $H_x=(46,27)R_g$ irradiating a flat disc with accretion rate $\dot{m}_{Edd}\sim(0.23,0.24)$ inclined to the line of sight by $i&lt;20^\circ$. To fit the lags as well as the SED, this model requires a low spin $a^\star=0$ and boosts disc color temperatures by a factor $f_{col}=1.8$, which shifts reprocessed light to shorter wavelengths. Our Bowl model with $f_{col}=1$ neglects relativity near the black hole but fits the UV-optical lags and SEDs using a flat disc with $\dot{m}_{Edd}&lt;0.06$ and a steep outer rim at $R_{out}/c\sim5-10$ days with H/R&lt;1%. This rim occurs near the $10^3$K dust sublimation temperature in the disc atmosphere, supporting models that invoke dust opacity to thicken the disc and launch failed radiatively-driven dusty outflows at the inner edge of the broad line region (BLR). Finally, the disc lags and SEDs exhibit a significant excess in the $u$ and $r$ bands, suggesting the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$ emission, respectively, from the BLR.</description>

      <title>ASKAP-EMU radio continuum detection of planetary nebula NGC 5189: the "Infinity" nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the radio continuum detection of well known Galactic Planetary Nebula (PN) NGC 5189, observed at 943 MHz during the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey. Two detections of NGC 5189 have been made during the survey, of better resolution than previous radio surveys. Both measurements of the integrated flux density are consistent with each other, at $S_{\rm 943\,MHz} = 0.33\pm0.03$ Jy, and the spectral luminosity is $L_{\rm{943\,MHz}}$ = 8.89 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$. Using available flux density measurements for radio-detections of NGC 5189, we calculate a radio surface brightness at 1 GHz and measure $\Sigma_{\rm 1~GHz}$ = 6.0 $\times$ 10$^{-21}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$, which is in the expected range for Galactic PNe. We measure an apparent size of 3.4${'}$ $\times$ 2.2${'}$ corresponding to physical diameters of 1.48 pc $\times$ 0.96 pc, and combine available radio observations of NGC 5189 to estimate a spectral index of $\alpha$ = 0.12 $\pm$ 0.05. Hence, we agree with previous findings that NGC 5189 is a thermal (free-free) emitting nebula. Additional measurements of the optical depth ($\tau = 0.00246$) and electron density ($N_{e} = 138~cm^{-3}$) support our findings that NGC 5189 is optically thin at 943 MHz. Furthermore, the radio contours from the ASKAP-EMU image have been overlaid onto a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 image, demonstrating that the radio morphology closely traces the optical. Notably, the contour alignment for the innermost region highlights the two envelopes of gas previously reported to be low-ionisation structures, which is considered a defining feature of post common-envelope PNe that surround a central Wolf-Rayet star.</description>

      <title>GNHeII J1236+6215: A He II $\lambda$1640 emitting and potentially LyC leaking galaxy at $z$ = 2.9803 unveiled through JWST &amp; Keck observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: He II $\lambda$1640 emission in galaxies indicates the presence of sources that produce extreme ionizing photons. Here, we report the discovery of a He II $\lambda$1640 emitting galaxy, GNHeII J1236+6215, at $z=$ 2.9803 in the GOODS-north field. We use photometry in 17 wavebands from near-UV to infrared to characterize the galaxy SED and combine Keck LRIS and JWST NIRSpec spectra to identify 15 emission lines including He II $\lambda$1640. We infer that the He$^+$ ionization in the galaxy could be driven by small pockets of young Population III stars or low-metallicity Very Massive Stars (VMSs) rather than AGN or metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. The galaxy has a highly ionized ISM ([OIII]5007/[OII]3727 = 7.28$\pm$0.11, [SIII]/[SII] = 1.97$\pm$0.48 and detected Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$ lines), little reddening by dust (E(B$-$V) = 0.04$\pm$0.12), low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.85$\pm$0.22), and high star formation rate (SFR$_{\rm SED}$ = 12.2$\pm$2.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). In addition to these ISM conditions, we also notice a significant [SII] deficiency ([SII]6718,6732/H$\alpha$ = 0.08$\pm$0.02, $\Delta$[SII] = $-$0.12) which may indicate the presence of density-bounded optically thin H~II regions that combined with the low dust extinction favor leaking of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. Our best-fit SED model also infers a high nebular ionization (log U = $-2.0$) and a low stellar mass M = 7.8$\pm3.1\times$10$^8$M$_{\odot}$. This discovery not only adds one important object to the known sample of high-redshift He~II emitters but also highlights a potential connection between He$^+$ ionization and favorable ISM conditions for the leakage of ionizing photons from galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way in context: The formation of galactic discs and chemical sequences from a cosmological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of chemical sequences in the stellar disc of Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies in a full cosmological context with the Auriga simulations. We focus on the conditions giving rise to bi-modal $\alpha$-chemistry in the MW disc and the potential influence of mergers (e.g. Gaia-Enceladus, GSE). We find a wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the emergence of dichotomous $\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The transition between multiple $\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated by modulations in the star formation rate (SFR). In some cases, this can be caused by the starburst and subsequent quiescence induced by mergers. In others, by exhaustion or violent disruption of the gas disc. Realisations with singular sequences either lack significant modulations in their SFR, or form too late to have a significant high-$\alpha$ sequence. The metallicity overlap between the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar neighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the circum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs losing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger events are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\Delta\text{[Fe/H]} \gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\alpha$ sequence in the MW. Finally, the shape of $\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe] plane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is observed in the low-$\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or declining SFR.</description>

      <title>Candidate red supergiants from Gaia DR3 BPRP spectra: From the Perseus to the Scutum-Crux spiral arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Our position within the Galactic plane and the dust obscuration make it challenging to retrieve a true picture of the Milky Way's morphology. While the Milky Way has been recognized as a barred spiral galaxy since the 1960s, there is still uncertainty about the exact number of spiral arms it contains. Currently, our understanding of the Galaxy is evolving thanks to the unprecedented detail provided by Gaia's parallactic distances. Aims. To shed light on the spatial distribution of red supergiants (RSGs) on the Disk and their uniformity of parameters across it, a census of Galactic RSGs detected by Gaia is needed. Methods. Candidate RSGs were extracted from the combined Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs using color criteria and parallactic distances. The sample includes 335 stars that were not included in catalogs of previously known RSGs detected by Gaia DR3. Interstellar and circumstellar extinction values were estimated from the infrared bands. Spectral types were collected from Simbad or VIZIER databases and, for 135 candidates, were inferred from the Gaia DR3 BPRP spectra. Stellar luminosities were inferred using photometric measurements and the Gaia DR3 distances. Results. The analysis yielded a genuine sample of O-rich late-type stars, and the calculated luminosities confirm that the sample is mostly made of stars brighter than Mbol=-5 mag. This new sample represents a 40% increase in the number of highly probable RSGs compared to previous studies. When looking at the X and Y distribution on the Galactic plane, beside the populous Perseus associations of RSGs and the Sagittarius group of RSGs, a novel population of highly probable RSGs populating the more distant Scutum-Centaurus arm appears.</description>

      <title>A Composite Broad-Line Region in SDSS J1609+4902: a Double-Peaked Disk component and a Gaussian Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The profiles of broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide critical insights into the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR), which in turn influence the uncertainties in estimating the masses of central supermassive black holes. In this study, we report the discovery of a low-luminosity AGN, SDSS J1609+4902, in which the H$\alpha$ line exhibits two distinct BLR components: a Gaussian component and an extremely broad double-peaked component. Follow-up observations conducted at the Lijiang Observatory in 2025 reveal that the line profile remains roughly unchanged, suggesting that this BLR structure may remain stable over a timescale of $\sim$10 years. We find that the size of the central Gaussian (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM$\sim 3000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) component is consistent with the classical reverberation mapping correlation. In contrast, the asymmetric double-peaked wing (FWHM$\sim 23,000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) likely originates from a disk-like BLR with an inner radius of approximately 70 gravitational radii. These results provide new constraints on the structure and dynamics of BLRs in AGNs and highlight the potential for long-term stability in such systems.</description>

      <title>ALMA-JELLY I: High Resolution CO(2-1) Observations of Ongoing Ram Pressure Stripping in NGC 4858 Reveal Asymmetrical Gas Tail Formation and Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new CO(2-1) observations (resolution $\sim1" = 460$pc) of the Coma cluster jellyfish galaxy NGC 4858 obtained from the ALMA-JELLY large program. Analyzing this data alongside complimentary Subaru H$\alpha$ and HST (F600LP / F350LP) observations, we find numerous structural and kinematic features indicative of the effects from strong, inclined ram pressure, including an asymmetric inner gas tail. We estimate a highly-inclined disk-wind angle of $\phi_{DW} = 75^{+10}_{-27}$. By subtracting a simple circular velocity model, we find (1): gas clumps that are being accelerated by ram pressure, and (2): signatures of gas clumps that had been previously pushed out of the disk but are now falling inwards. We also discuss head-tail morphologies in star complexes within the stellar disk that appear to be RPS-influenced. Lastly, we compare this galaxy to state-of-the-art galaxy ``wind tunnel'' simulations. We find that this galaxy is one of the best nearby examples of strong and inclined ram pressure gas stripping, and of gas that is perturbed by ram pressure but not fully stripped and falls back. We emphasize the importance of torques due to ram pressure in highly-inclined interactions, which help drive gas inwards on the side rotating against the wind, contributing to the formation of asymmetric inner RPS tails.</description>

      <title>The Internal Kinematics, Stellar Population, and Gas-phase Properties of The Pseudobulge in An Ultra-diffuse Galaxy: AGC721966</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the central stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population properties, star formation history, and gas-phase chemical abundances in AGC721966, a unique ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) harboring a pseudobulge. Our findings reveal that the pseudobulge formed in the early universe but underwent a recent episode of rejuvenated star formation. The system exhibits a mass-weighted (light-weighted) stellar population age of $\tau_{\star}\sim 7.4\pm2.5$ ($2.9\pm1.5$)~Gyr, a stellar metallicity of [M/H]$\sim -0.62\pm0.26$ ($-0.55\pm0.20$), an $\alpha$-element enhancement of [$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim 0.36\pm0.09$ ($0.37\pm0.07$), and a gas-phase oxygen abundance of \Oabund$\sim 8.15\pm0.03$. The central stellar velocity dispersion is measured as $\sigma_{\rm c}\sim 57.9\pm15.7$~km/s. These results provide robust evidence supporting the early halo-halo merging formation scenario proposed by \cite{Rong25}, while unequivocally ruling out the ``failed'' $L^{\star}$ formation model, at least for AGC721966. Furthermore, through systematic application of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we establish that these pseudobulge-hosting UDGs are neither misidentified nuclear star cluster-bearing dwarf galaxies nor bulge-dominated massive galaxies, thereby affirming their distinct evolutionary pathway.</description>

      <title>Main-sequence Turnoff Stars as Probes of the Ancient Galactic Relic: Chemo-dynamical Analysis of a Pilot Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) stars well preserve the chemical properties where they were born, making them ideal tracers for studying the stellar population. We perform a detailed chemo-dynamical analysis on moderately metal-poor ($-2.0&lt;\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&lt;-1.0$) MSTO stars to explore the early accretion history of the Milky Way. Our sample includes four stars observed with high-resolution spectroscopy using CFHT/ESPaDOnS and 163 nearby MSTO stars selected from the SAGA database with high-resolution results. Within the action-angle spaces, we identified Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE, 35), stars born in the Milky Way (in situ, 31), and other substructures (21). We find that both GSE and in-situ stars present a similar Li plateau around $A(\mathrm{Li)}\sim 2.17$. GSE shows a clear $\alpha$-knee feature in Mg at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-1.60\pm 0.06$, while the $\alpha$-elements of in-situ stars remain nearly constant within the metallicity range. The iron-peak elements show little difference between GSE and in-situ stars except for Zn and Ni, which decrease in GSE at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&gt;-1.6$, while they remain constant in in-situ stars. Among heavy elements, GSE shows overall enhancement in Eu, with [Ba/Eu] increasing with the metallicity, while this ratio remains almost constant for in-situ stars, suggesting the contribution of longer time-scale sources to the $s$-process in GSE. Moreover, for the first time, we present the $r$-process abundance pattern for an extremely $r$-process enhanced ($r$-II) GSE star, which appears consistent with the solar $r$-process pattern except for Pr. Further investigation of larger GSE samples using high-resolution spectra is required to explore the reason for the significantly higher Pr in the GSE r-II star.</description>

      <title>Redshift ~2.7 is not special</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galikyan et al. (2025) reported a statistically significant change in galaxy spectral properties at redshift $z$ $\simeq$ 2.7 based on a Kolmogorov analysis of JWST spectroscopic data of galaxies. In this comment, we demonstrate that their result is critically driven by a single outlier in the dataset. This outlier arises from the use of a questionable redshift estimate for one spectrum. When the outlier is removed or the redshift is corrected, the claimed transition at $z$ $\simeq$ 2.7 disappears entirely. By independently reproducing their analysis, we demonstrate that the claimed feature is not a robust statistical signal, but an artefact of this anomalous data point.</description>

      <title>Traces of the evolution of cosmic void galaxies: An Integral Field Spectroscopy based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies in the most underdense regions of the Universe, known as cosmic voids, exhibit astrophysical properties that suggest a distinct evolutionary path compared to galaxies in denser environments. Numerical simulations indicate that the assembly of void galaxies occurs later, leading to galaxies with younger stellar populations, low metallicities, and a high gas content in their halos, which provides the fuel to sustain elevated star formation activity. Our objective in this work is to test these numerical predictions with observational data by comparing galaxies in voids with galaxies in non-void environments. We used voids identified in SDSS data and galaxies from the MaNGA survey, which provides galaxies with integral field spectroscopy (IFS). We separated the galaxies into void and non-void samples, mimicked the magnitude distribution, and compared their integrated astrophysical properties as well as the metallicity and age profiles through a stacking technique, ETGs and LTGs separately. We find that void galaxies have younger and less metal-rich stellar populations. Regarding gas mass, we do not find differences across environments. When dividing galaxies into ETGs and LTGs, we observe that ETGs show negative gradients in both age and metallicity, with void galaxies consistently appearing younger and less metal-rich. For LTGs, age gradients are also negative, showing younger populations in void galaxies. However, we do not find statistically significant differences in stellar metallicity gradients between void and non-void environments. Our results show how the astrophysical properties of galaxies in voids differ from those of galaxies in the rest of the Universe. This suggests that the void environment plays a role in the evolution of its galaxies, delaying their assembly and growth.</description>

      <title>The link between galaxy merger, radio jet expansion and molecular outflow in the ULIRG IRAS 00183-7111</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 00183-7111 ($z=0.328$) is one of the three ULIRGs that are currently known to host an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with young radio jets. We present a detailed study of the link between galaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and galactic-scale molecular outflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging. The latter allows us to put - for the first time - tight constraints on the assembly history of the system, confirming that it formed through a major merger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde encounter and no older than 2 Gyr. The recent merger channelled about $(1.0\pm0.1)\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas in the central regions of the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between the CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely contributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio jets, which are no older than 2 Myr. Furthermore, by comparing the relative strength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e. $T_{\rm ex}\gg50$ K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM interaction. A qualitative study of the CO kinematics also demonstrates that, despite the overall disturbed dynamical state with no clear signs of regular rotation, at least one non-rotational kinematic component can be identified and likely associated to an outflow with $v_{\rm out}\approx 556$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M_{\rm out}}\approx 110$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: We present a new framework for massive star evolution that is no longer driven by Dutch or other mass-loss rate Recipes, but which take the physics of Gamma or L/M dependent mass loss consistently into account. We first discuss the hot-star mass-loss kink and the transition mass loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before discussing vertical stellar evolution, mass evaporation, and the maximum black hole (BH) mass. We end with a suggestion that a recently uncovered red supergiant (RSG) kink might be related to similar underlying L/M physics as the hot-star kink.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXVI. The dust opacity spectral indices of protostellar envelopes bridge the gap between interstellar medium and disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sub-millimetre dust opacity spectral index is a critical observable to constrain dust properties, such as the maximum grain size of an observed dust population. It has been widely measured at galactic scales and down to protoplanetary disks. However, because of observational and analytical challenges, quite a gap exists in measuring dust properties in the envelopes that feed newborn protostars and their disks. To fill this gap, we use sensitive dust continuum emission data at 1.2 and 3.1 mm from the ALMA FAUST Large Program and constrain the dust opacity millimetre spectral index around a sample of protostars. Our high-resolution data, along with a more refined methodology with respect to past efforts, allow us to disentangle disk and envelope contributions in the uv-plane, and thus measure spectral indices for the envelopes uncontaminated by the optically thick emission of the inner regions. First, we find that the young disks are small and optically thick. Secondly, we measure the dust opacity spectral index at envelope scales for n=11 sources: the beta of n=9 sources had never been constrained in the literature. We effectively double the number of sources for which the dust opacity spectral index beta has been measured at these scales. Third, combining the available literature measurements with our own (total n=18), we show how envelope spectral indices distribute between ISM-like and disk-like values, bridging the gap in the inferred dust evolution. Finally, we statistically confirm a significant correlation between beta and the mass of protostellar envelopes, previously suggested in the literature. Our findings indicate that the dust optical properties smoothly vary from the ISM, through envelopes and all the way down to disks. Multi-wavelength surveys are needed to further this study and make more general claims on dust evolution in its pathway from cloud to disks.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of LLM integration in final-year undergraduate astronomy education, examining how students develop AI literacy through structured guidance and documentation requirements. We developed AstroTutor, a domain-specific astronomy tutoring system enhanced with curated arXiv content, and deployed it alongside general-purpose LLMs in the course. Students documented their AI usage through homework reflections and post-course surveys. We analyzed student evolution in AI interaction strategies and conducted experimental comparisons of LLM-assisted versus traditional grading methods. LLM grading showed strong correlation with human evaluation while providing more detailed and consistent feedback. We also piloted LLM-facilitated interview-based examinations as a scalable alternative to traditional assessments, demonstrating potential for individualized evaluation that addresses common testing limitations. Students experienced decreased rather than increased reliance on LLMs over the semester, developing critical evaluation skills and strategic tool selection. They evolved from basic assistance-seeking to verification workflows, with documentation requirements fostering metacognitive awareness. Students developed effective prompting strategies, contextual enrichment techniques, and cross-verification practices. Our findings suggest that structured LLM integration with transparency requirements and domain-specific tools can enhance astronomy education while building essential AI literacy skills. We provide implementation guidelines for educators and make our AstroTutor repository freely available.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmology and baryonic feedback with joint analysis of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 lensing data and ACT DR6 thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing (shear) data obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M &lt; 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}/h$, supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a $2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally, we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear cross-correlation measurements, employing mitigation techniques to ensure a robust inference.

      <title>Blue Stragglers prefer peaceful environments because binaries do the same</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are core hydrogen-burning stars routinely observed in resolved stellar systems. According to the theory of single star evolution they should not exist because, due to their large mass, they should have already evolved to stellar remnants. Hence, they are suspected to be the result of mass-enhancement processes, like mass-transfer activity in binary systems, mergers in binary or higher order systems, or direct stellar collisions, possibly mediated by dynamical interactions. Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) are templates of collisional stellar systems, where frequent gravitational interactions among stars occur on timescales shorter than their age. Thus, in these systems the number of BSSs originated by stellar collisions is expected to increase with the local stellar density and the collision rate. Here we analyse a sample of more than 3000 BSSs homogeneously observed in 48 GGCs with different structures, and we find that the number of BSSs normalized to the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the central density, the collision rate, and the dynamical age of the parent cluster. We also find strikingly similar trends between these environmental properties and the cluster binary fraction, indicating that the latter decreases in high density/high collisional regions. We finally demonstrate that the correlations found between BSSs and the environmental parameters are explained by an underlying dependence of the BSS specific frequency on binary fraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS phenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly because of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of both BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a binary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Determining the methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Orionis with laboratory measured spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation, as studied through mono-deuterated methanol, is frequently used as a diagnostic tool to trace the physical conditions and chemical evolution of interstellar sources. This study investigates methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Ori, utilising recent laboratory spectroscopic data for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD along with ALMA observations. The derived column densities for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD are (5.14$\pm$0.08) $\times $10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (4.22$\pm$0.06) $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The analysis demonstrates the influence of spectroscopic data on determining molecular column density, excitation temperature, and, most importantly, the inferred D/H ratio. The D/H ratio for CH$_2$DOH is calculated to be (7.3$\pm$1.5) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ after applying a statistical correction, whilst the D/H ratio for CH$_3$OD is (1.79$\pm$0.36) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$. The discovery of an unexpectedly low CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OD ratio (1.22$\pm$0.02) in V883 Ori, however, raises further questions about the synthesis and chemical processes involved in CH$_3$OD formation. Overall, this study underscores the importance of accurate spectroscopic data for studies of isotopic fractionation and provides new insights into methanol deuteration chemistry in star-forming regions. Future research, combining updated spectroscopy and chemical modelling, will help further constrain these processes across different masses and evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper (MWM): ASPCAP Stellar Parameters and Abundances in SDSS-V Data Release 19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe the science verification of Milky Way Mapper (MWM) ASPCAP data products published in Data Release 19 (DR19) of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). We compare MWM ASPCAP atmospheric parameters T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, 24 abundances of 21 elements (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have multiple sources for deriving their abundance values) and their uncertainties determined from APOGEE spectrograph spectra with those of the literature and evaluate their accuracy and precision. We also test the zero-point calibration of the v$_{\rm rad}$ derived by the APOGEE Data Reduction Pipeline. This data release contains ASPCAP parameters for 964,989 stars, including all APOGEE-2 targets expanded with new observations of 336,511 stars from the Apache Point Observatory (APO) observed until 4 July 2023. Overall, the new T$_{\rm eff}$ values show excellent agreement with the IRFM scale, while the surface gravities exhibit slight systematic offsets compared to asteroseisimic gravities. The estimated precision of T$_{\rm eff}$ is between 50 and 70 K for giants and 70$-$100 K for dwarfs, while surface gravities are measured with a precision of 0.07$-$0.09 dex for giants. We achieve an estimated precision of 0.02$-$0.04 dex for multiple elements, including metallicity, $\alpha$, Mg, and Si, while the precision of at least 10 elements is better than 0.1 dex.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Parameters for Central Stars of 103 Infrared Bowshock Nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar bowshock nebulae are arcuate shock fronts formed by the interaction of radiation-driven stellar winds and the relative motion of the ambient interstellar material. Stellar bowshock nebulae provide a promising means to measure wind-driven mass loss, independent of other established methods. In this work, we characterize the stellar sources at the center of bowshock nebulae drawn from all-sky catalogs of 24 $\mu$m-selected nebulae. We obtain new, low-resolution blue optical spectra for \numstars~stars and measure stellar parameters temperature \teff, surface gravity \logg, and projected rotational broadening \vsini. We perform additional photometric analysis to measure stellar radius \rstar, luminosity \lstar, and visual-band extinction $A_V$. All but one of our targets are O and early B stars, with temperatures ranging from $T$=16.5--46.8~k\kelvin, gravities $\log g=$2.57--4.60, and \vsini~from $&lt;$100--400~\kms. With the exception of rapid rotator $\zeta$ Oph, bowshock stars do not rotate at or near critical velocities. At least 60 of 103 (60\%) OB bowshock stars are binaries, consistent with the multiplicity fraction of other OB samples. The sample shows a runaway fraction of 23\%, with \numrunaway~stars having $v_{\text{2D}}\geq25$~\kms. Of the 19 runaways, at least 15 ($\geq$79\%) are binaries, favoring dynamical ejection over the binary supernova channel for producing runaways. We provide a comprehensive census of stellar parameters for bowshock stars, useful as a foundation for determining the mass-loss rates for OB-type stars -- one of the single most critical factors in stellar evolution governing the production of neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the T Tauri Binary Separation Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri binaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the field population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most stars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical processing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations. However, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational selection bias. Close binaries within a &lt; 100 au clear out their dusty circumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single stars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries that have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the separation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately dense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By limiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the artificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments. Across wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of companions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius matches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three environments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment of solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a &lt; 10,000 au in Taurus is only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased observations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N-body interactions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal dynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a &lt; 100 au.</description>

      <title>Not so dark, not so dense: an alternative explanation for the lensing subhalo in SDSSJ0946+1006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies of the strong lens system SDSSJ0946+1006 have reported a dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite. Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are artificially compact.</description>

      <title>Study of Various Dark Matter Halo Profiles in Milky Way and M31 Galaxies within the Standard Cosmology Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rotation curves of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) and Andromeda galaxy (M31) by considering their bulge, disk, and halo components. We model the bulge region by the widely accepted de Vaucouleur's law and the disk region by the well-established exponential profile. In order to understand the distribution of dark matter in the halo region, we consider three different dark matter profiles in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, namely, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Hernquist, and Einasto profiles. We use recent datasets of rotation curves of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The data consist of rotation velocities of the stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of the radial distance from the center. Using Bayesian statistics, we perform an overall fit including all the components, i.e., bulge, disk, and halo, with the data. Our results indicate that the NFW and Hernquist profiles are in concordance with the observational data points. However, the Einasto profile poorly explains the behavior of dark matter in both the galaxies.</description>

      <title>A large-scale ring galaxy at z = 2.2 revealed by JWST/NIRCam: kinematic observations and analytical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H$\alpha$ kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass $M_{\rm{ring}} = 2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ and radius $R_{ring}$ = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of $M_{bulge} = 8 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of $M_{mol,gas} = 7.1 \times 10^{10}M_\odot$ and $M_{dust} = 3 \times 10^8 M_\odot$ over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that $\sim 10\%$ of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.</description>

      <title>The Emerging Black Hole Mass Function in the High-Redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have identified an abundant population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) already in place during the first few hundred million years of cosmic history. Most of them appear overmassive relative to the stellar mass in their host systems, challenging models of early black hole seeding and growth. Multiple pathways exist to explain their formation, including heavy seeds formed from direct collapse/supermassive stars or sustained super-Eddington accretion onto light stellar remnant seeds. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to predict the emerging SMBH mass function under physically motivated models for both light and heavy seed formation, to be compared with upcoming ultra-deep JWST surveys. We find that both pathways can reproduce observations at $z\sim5-6$, but have distinct features at higher redshifts of $z\sim10$. Specifically, JWST observations have the potential to constrain the fraction of efficiently accreting (super-Eddington) SMBHs, as well as the existence and prevalence of heavy seeds, in particular through ultra-deep observations of blank fields and/or gravitational lensing surveys. Such observations will provide key insights to understand the process of SMBH formation and evolution during the emergence of the first galaxies. We further emphasize the great promise of possible SMBH detections at $z\gtrsim 15$ with future JWST observations to break the degeneracy between light- and heavy-seed models.</description>

      <title>Morphological Feature Distances Among the Spectral Types of SDSS Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the morphological feature distances among various spectral types of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, including strong and weak active galactic nuclei (AGN), quasi-stellar objects (QSO), quiescent, and star-forming galaxies. We evaluated the clustering and relative distances of these spectral types in the multidimensional morphological feature space. The results indicate that AGN and QSOs are more closely associated with quiescent galaxies than with star-forming ones, indicating a potential regulation of star formation by AGN activity. Furthermore, the analysis underlines the role of AGN feedback in the dwarf regime having $\sim$10%-50% closer distances from AGN types to the quiescent type than to the star-forming type in the dwarf regime $-18 &gt; M_r &gt; -20$, compared to $&lt;$15% closer in the massive regime $M_r &lt; -21$. The continuous probability analysis of spectral types being Hubble types upholds the distance analysis results having a range of the probability distribution of AGN types similar to the quiescent type, especially in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The competing effects of recent and long-term star formation histories on oxygen, nitrogen, and stellar metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) - the three-way trend between galaxy stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs) and gaseous metallicities - remains amongst the most studied extragalactic relations. Furthermore, metallicity correlates particularly tightly with gravitational potential. Simulations support a shared origin for these relations relating to long-term gas inflow history variations; however, differences between simulated and observed galaxy samples make it unclear whether this holds for real galaxies. We use MaNGA integral field observations to probe these relations in star-forming galaxies at one effective radius. We confirm the FMR and equivalent relations for stellar metallicity (FMR*) and gaseous N/O (fundamental nitrogen relation, FNR). We find that all relations persist when considering gravitational potential in place of stellar mass and/or considering stellar ages in place of SFR, with the gaseous relations strengthened significantly by considering potential. The gaseous FMR disappears at high masses/potentials, while the FNR persists and the FMR* strengthens. Our results suggest a unified interpretation of galaxies' gaseous and stellar metallicities and their N/O abundances in terms of their formation histories. Deeper gravitational potentials correspond to earlier star-formation histories (SFHs) and faster gas consumption, producing tight potential-abundance relations for stars and gas. In weak potentials, galaxy SFR variations primarily result from recent gas inflows, mostly affecting gas abundances. In deeper potentials, SFR variations instead correspond to broad differences in SFH shapes resulting from differences in long-term gas consumption histories, which is most visible in stellar abundances. This unified interpretation could be confirmed with upcoming higher redshift spectroscopic surveys.</description>

We compare these to the [CII] line at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21 cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of [CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand, and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures typical of HII regions.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Resolving the Hot and Ionized Universe through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An omnipresent feature of the multi-phase ``cosmic web'' is that warm/hot (&gt;$10^5$ K) ionized gas pervades it. This gas constitutes a relevant contribution to the overall universal matter budget across multiple scales, from the several tens of Mpc-scale IGM filaments, to the Mpc ICM, all the way down to the CGM surrounding individual galaxies from ~1 kpc up to their respective virial radii (~100 kpc). The study of the hot baryonic component of cosmic matter density represents a powerful means for constraining the intertwined evolution of galactic populations and large-scale cosmological structures, for tracing the matter assembly in the Universe and its thermal history. To this end, the SZ effect provides the ideal observational tool for measurements out to the beginnings of structure formation. The SZ effect is caused by the scattering of the photons from the cosmic microwave background off the hot electrons embedded within cosmic structures, and provides a redshift-independent perspective on the thermal and kinematic properties of the warm/hot gas. Still, current and future (sub)mm facilities have been providing only a partial view of the SZ Universe due to any combination of: limited angular resolution, spectral coverage, field of view, spatial dynamic range, sensitivity. In this paper, we motivate the development of a wide-field, broad-band, multi-chroic continuum instrument for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) by identifying the scientific drivers that will deepen our understanding of the complex thermal evolution of cosmic structures. On a technical side, this will necessarily require efficient multi-wavelength mapping of the SZ signal with an unprecedented spatial dynamic range (from arcsecond to tens of arcminutes) and we employ theoretical forecasts to determine the key instrumental constraints for achieving our goals.

      <title>How black hole mimickers and Shapiro-free lenses signal effective dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of two exotic compact objects in the leading relativistic model of modified Newtonian dynamics, namely aether-scalar-tensor theory. This model is consistent with precision cosmology and gravitational wave constraints on tensor speed. Black hole mimickers could subtly change observations: gravitational waves from their mergers might show unusual echoes or altered ringdown patterns, and images of their horizon-scale shadows might be slightly different from those of a true black hole. Shapiro-free lenses are massless objects that deflect light without any gravitational time delay, producing distinctive lensing events. These predictions connect to ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches, horizon-scale imaging, and time-domain lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and 22 Elemental Abundances for FGK Stars Derived From LAMOST Low-resolution Spectra with DD-Payne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of our Galaxy desires detailed decomposition of its stellar populations via their chemical fingerprints. This requires precise stellar abundances of many elements for a large number of stars. Here we present an updated catalog of stellar labels derived from LAMOST low-resolution spectra in a physics-sensible and rigorous manner with DD-Payne, taking labels from high-resolution spectroscopy as training set. The catalog contains atmospheric parameters for 6.4 million stars released in LAMOST DR9, and abundances for 22 elements, namely, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, for nearly 3.6 million stars with spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 20. The [Fe/H] is valid down to $\sim$-4.0, while elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] are mostly valid for stars with [Fe/H] $\gtrsim-2.0$. Measurement errors in these labels are sensitive to and almost inversely proportional with SNR. For stars with S/N&gt;50, we achieved a typical error of 30 K in Teff, 0.07 dex in $\log g$, $\sim0.05$ dex in abundances for most elements with atomic number smaller than Sr, and 0.1--0.2 dex for heavier elements. Homogenization to the label estimates is carried out via dedicated internal and external calibration. In particular, the non-local thermal equilibrium effect is corrected for the [Fe/H] estimates, the Teff is calibrated to the infrared flux method scale, and the $\log~g$ is validated with asteroseismic measurements. The elemental abundances are internally calibrated using wide binaries, eliminating systematic trend with effective temperature. The catalog is publicly available.</description>
