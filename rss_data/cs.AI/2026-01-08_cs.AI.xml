      <title>Mastering the Game of Go with Self-play Experience Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.</description>

      <title>Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Instruction Following: An Evaluation-Driven Multi-Agentic Workflow for Prompt Instructions Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.</description>

      <title>Exploration Through Introspection: A Self-Aware Reward Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.</description>

      <title>Toward Maturity-Based Certification of Embodied AI: Quantifying Trustworthiness Through Measurement Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03470v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a maturity-based framework for certifying embodied AI systems through explicit measurement mechanisms. We argue that certifiable embodied AI requires structured assessment frameworks, quantitative scoring mechanisms, and methods for navigating multi-objective trade-offs inherent in trustworthiness evaluation. We demonstrate this approach using uncertainty quantification as an exemplar measurement mechanism and illustrate feasibility through an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) detection case study.</description>

      <title>CPGPrompt: Translating Clinical Guidelines into LLM-Executable Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.</description>

      <title>Personalization of Large Foundation Models for Health Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Evolving Programmatic Skill Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.</description>

      <title>Variance Computation for Weighted Model Counting with Knowledge Compilation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.</description>

      <title>STAR-S: Improving Safety Alignment through Self-Taught Reasoning on Safety Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.</description>

      <title>ReEfBench: Quantifying the Reasoning Efficiency of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.</description>

      <title>SCRIBE: Structured Mid-Level Supervision for Tool-Using Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.</description>

      <title>Controllable LLM Reasoning via Sparse Autoencoder-Based Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.</description>

      <title>Interleaved Tool-Call Reasoning for Protein Function Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.</description>

      <title>Architecting Agentic Communities using Design Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.</description>

      <title>How Does the Thinking Step Influence Model Safety? An Entropy-based Safety Reminder for LRMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.</description>

      <title>Sandwich Reasoning: An Answer-Reasoning-Answer Approach for Low-Latency Query Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.</description>

      <title>Personalized Medication Planning via Direct Domain Modeling and LLM-Generated Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.</description>

      <title>EntroCoT: Enhancing Chain-of-Thought via Adaptive Entropy-Guided Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03769v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.</description>

      <title>ROI-Reasoning: Rational Optimization for Inference via Pre-Computation Meta-Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>XAI-LAW: A Logic Programming Tool for Modeling, Explaining, and Learning Legal Decisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.</description>

      <title>Formally Explaining Decision Tree Models with Answer Set Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>xDNN(ASP): Explanation Generation System for Deep Neural Networks powered by Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.</description>

      <title>Current Agents Fail to Leverage World Model as Tool for Foresight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03905v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.</description>

      <title>Trade-R1: Bridging Verifiable Rewards to Stochastic Environments via Process-Level Reasoning Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03948v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.</description>

      <title>Anti-Length Shift: Dynamic Outlier Truncation for Training Efficient Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.</description>

      <title>MobileDreamer: Generative Sketch World Model for GUI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model.

      <title>ComfySearch: Autonomous Exploration and Reasoning for ComfyUI Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality. To tackle these limitations, we present ComfySearch, an agentic framework that can effectively explore the component space and generate functional ComfyUI pipelines via validation-guided workflow construction. Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.</description>

      <title>Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.</description>

      <title>DeepResearch-Slice: Bridging the Retrieval-Utilization Gap via Explicit Text Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.</description>

      <title>Internal Reasoning vs. External Control: A Thermodynamic Analysis of Sycophancy in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03263v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit sycophancy: prioritizing agreeableness over correctness. Current remedies evaluate reasoning outcomes: RLHF rewards correct answers, self-correction critiques outputs. All require ground truth, which is often unavailable at inference time and vulnerable to the same biases. We explore evaluating the reasoning process instead. Regulated Causal Anchoring (RCA) verifies whether outputs follow from their reasoning traces, without requiring ground truth. Sycophancy manifests as trace-output inconsistency: models derive one answer but output another to please users. RCA detects this inconsistency, achieving 0.0% sycophancy while accepting 88% of valid hints. We identify two failures invisible to outcome evaluation: Inverse Scaling (frontier models sycophant more because rationalization requires capability) and the Final Output Gap (correct reasoning precedes sycophantic output). Traditional self-correction reduces these failures to 7-9% but cannot eliminate them because the model critiques itself with the same biases. RCA's process evaluation operates at inference time, requires no ground truth, and uses an independent judge that breaks the self-reinforcing bias loop: three properties that outcome evaluation lacks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Adapting On-Device Large Language Models for Clinical Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.</description>

      <title>OpenAI GPT-5 System Card</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.</description>

      <title>The Instruction Gap: LLMs get lost in Following Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.</description>

      <title>Advances and Challenges in Semantic Textual Similarity: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) research has expanded rapidly since 2021, driven by advances in transformer architectures, contrastive learning, and domain-specific techniques. This survey reviews progress across six key areas: transformer-based models, contrastive learning, domain-focused solutions, multi-modal methods, graph-based approaches, and knowledge-enhanced techniques. Recent transformer models such as FarSSiBERT and DeBERTa-v3 have achieved remarkable accuracy, while contrastive methods like AspectCSE have established new benchmarks. Domain-adapted models, including CXR-BERT for medical texts and Financial-STS for finance, demonstrate how STS can be effectively customized for specialized fields. Moreover, multi-modal, graph-based, and knowledge-integrated models further enhance semantic understanding and representation. By organizing and analyzing these developments, the survey provides valuable insights into current methods, practical applications, and remaining challenges. It aims to guide researchers and practitioners alike in navigating rapid advancements, highlighting emerging trends and future opportunities in the evolving field of STS.</description>

      <title>Less is more: Not all samples are effective for evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.</description>

      <title>GuardEval: A Multi-Perspective Benchmark for Evaluating Safety, Fairness, and Robustness in LLM Moderators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.</description>

      <title>LLM_annotate: A Python package for annotating and analyzing fiction characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM_annotate is a Python package for analyzing the personality of fiction characters with large language models. It standardizes workflows for annotating character behaviors in full texts (e.g., books and movie scripts), inferring character traits, and validating annotation/inference quality via a human-in-the-loop GUI. The package includes functions for text chunking, LLM-based annotation, character name disambiguation, quality scoring, and computation of character-level statistics and embeddings. Researchers can use any LLM, commercial, open-source, or custom, within LLM_annotate. Through tutorial examples using The Simpsons Movie and the novel Pride and Prejudice, I demonstrate the usage of the package for efficient and reproducible character analyses.</description>

      <title>Topic Segmentation Using Generative Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MixRx uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify drug combination interactions as Additive, Synergistic, or Antagonistic, given a multi-drug patient history. We evaluate the performance of 4 models, GPT-2, Mistral Instruct 2.0, and the fine-tuned counterparts. Our results showed a potential for such an application, with the Mistral Instruct 2.0 Fine-Tuned model providing an average accuracy score on standard and perturbed datasets of 81.5%. This paper aims to further develop an upcoming area of research that evaluates if LLMs can be used for biological prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Model for Constrained Markowitz Modern Portfolio Using Slack Variables to Process Mixed-Binary Optimization under QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively encoding inequality constraints is a primary obstacle in applying quantum algorithms to financial optimization. A quantum model for Markowitz portfolio optimization is presented that resolves this by embedding slack variables directly into the problem Hamiltonian. The method maps each slack variable to a dedicated ancilla qubit, transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation suitable for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This process internalizes the constraints within the quantum state, altering the problem's energy landscape to facilitate optimization. The model is empirically validated through simulation, showing it consistently finds the optimal portfolio where a standard penalty-based QAOA fails. This work demonstrates that modifying the Hamiltonian architecture via a slack-ancilla scheme provides a robust and effective pathway for solving constrained optimization problems on quantum computers. A fundamental quantum limit on the simultaneous precision of portfolio risk and return is also posited.</description>

      <title>$\alpha^3$-Bench: A Unified Benchmark of Safety, Robustness, and Efficiency for LLM-Based UAV Agents over 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as high level controllers for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions. However, existing evaluations rarely assess whether such agents remain safe, protocol compliant, and effective under realistic next generation networking constraints. This paper introduces $\alpha^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations.
  To reflect modern agentic workflows, $\alpha^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $\alpha^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

      <title>AI-Guided Discovery of Novel Ionic Liquid Solvents for Industrial CO2 Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.</description>

      <title>Feedback Indices to Evaluate LLM Responses to Rebuttals for Multiple Choice Type Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework of indices designed to characterize Large Language Model (LLM) responses when challenged with rebuttals during a chat. Assessing how LLMs respond to user dissent is crucial for understanding their reliability and behavior patterns, yet the complexity of human-LLM interactions makes systematic evaluation challenging. Our approach employs a fictitious-response rebuttal method that quantifies LLM behavior when presented with multiple-choice questions followed by deliberate challenges to their fictitious previous response. The indices are specifically designed to detect and measure what could be characterized as sycophantic behavior (excessive agreement with user challenges) or stubborn responses (rigid adherence to the fictitious response in the chat history) from LLMs. These metrics allow investigation of the relationships between sycophancy, stubbornness, and the model's actual mastery of the subject matter. We demonstrate the utility of these indices using two physics problems as test scenarios with various OpenAI models. The framework is intentionally generalizable to any multiple-choice format question, including on topics without universally accepted correct answers. Our results reveal measurable differences across OpenAI model generations, with trends indicating that newer models and those employing greater "Reasoning Effort" exhibit reduced sycophantic behavior. The FR pairing method combined with our proposed indices provides a practical, adaptable toolkit for systematically comparing LLM dialogue behaviors across different models and contexts.</description>

Abstract: In this report, we present HyperCLOVA X 32B Think, a vision-language model designed with particular emphasis on reasoning within the Korean linguistic and cultural context, as well as agentic ability. HyperCLOVA X 32B Think is pre-trained with a strong focus on reasoning capabilities and subsequently post-trained to support multimodal understanding, enhanced reasoning, agentic behaviors, and alignment with human preferences. Experimental evaluations against comparably sized models demonstrate that our model achieves strong performance on Korean text-to-text and vision-to-text benchmarks, as well as on agent-oriented evaluation tasks. By open-sourcing HyperCLOVA X 32B Think, we aim to support broader adoption and facilitate further research and innovation across both academic and industrial communities.</description>

      <title>Automated Post-Incident Policy Gap Analysis via Threat-Informed Evidence Mapping using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybersecurity post-incident reviews are essential for identifying control failures and improving organisational resilience, yet they remain labour-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on expert judgment. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&amp;CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework. The findings suggest that LLM-assisted analysis has the potential to improve the efficiency, consistency, and auditability of post-incident evaluations, while highlighting the continued need for human oversight in high-stakes cybersecurity decision-making.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Transformer Architectures for Edge Devices in Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.</description>

      <title>AgentMark: Utility-Preserving Behavioral Watermarking for Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed to autonomously solve complex tasks, raising urgent needs for IP protection and regulatory provenance. While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation. The code is available at https://github.com/Tooooa/AgentMark.</description>

      <title>130k Lines of Formal Topology in Two Weeks: Simple and Cheap Autoformalization for Everyone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a brief description of a project that has already autoformalized a large portion of the general topology from the Munkres textbook (which has in total 241 pages in 7 chapters and 39 sections). The project has been running since November 21, 2025 and has as of January 4, 2026, produced 160k lines of formalized topology. Most of it (about 130k lines) have been done in two weeks,from December 22 to January 4, for an LLM subscription cost of about \$100. This includes a 3k-line proof of Urysohn's lemma, a 2k-line proof of Urysohn's Metrization theorem, over 10k-line proof of the Tietze extension theorem, and many more (in total over 1.5k lemmas/theorems). The approach is quite simple and cheap: build a long-running feedback loop between an LLM and a reasonably fast proof checker equipped with a core foundational library. The LLM is now instantiated as ChatGPT (mostly 5.2) or Claude Sonnet (4.5) run through the respective Codex or Claude Code command line interfaces. The proof checker is Chad Brown's higher-order set theory system Megalodon, and the core library is Brown's formalization of basic set theory and surreal numbers (including reals, etc). The rest is some prompt engineering and technical choices which we describe here. Based on the fast progress, low cost, virtually unknown ITP/library, and the simple setup available to everyone, we believe that (auto)formalization may become quite easy and ubiquitous in 2026, regardless of which proof assistant is used.</description>

      <title>PC2P: Multi-Agent Path Finding via Personalized-Enhanced Communication and Crowd Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence's dual-use nature is revolutionizing the cybersecurity landscape, introducing new threats across four main categories: deepfakes and synthetic media, adversarial AI attacks, automated malware, and AI-powered social engineering. This paper aims to analyze emerging risks, attack mechanisms, and defense shortcomings related to AI in cybersecurity. We introduce a comparative taxonomy connecting AI capabilities with threat modalities and defenses, review over 70 academic and industry references, and identify impactful opportunities for research, such as hybrid detection pipelines and benchmarking frameworks. The paper is structured thematically by threat type, with each section addressing technical context, real-world incidents, legal frameworks, and countermeasures. Our findings emphasize the urgency for explainable, interdisciplinary, and regulatory-compliant AI defense systems to maintain trust and security in digital ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.</description>

      <title>VLM4VLA: Revisiting Vision-Language-Models in Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.</description>

      <title>Why LLMs Aren't Scientists Yet: Lessons from Four Autonomous Research Attempts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a case study of four end-to-end attempts to autonomously generate ML research papers using a pipeline of six LLM agents mapped to stages of the scientific workflow. Of these four, three attempts failed during implementation or evaluation. One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design. We conclude by discussing four design principles for more robust AI-scientist systems, implications for autonomous scientific discovery, and we release all prompts, artifacts, and outputs at https://github.com/Lossfunk/ai-scientist-artefacts-v1</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Image Recognition for Soft-Shell Shrimp Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.</description>

      <title>CaricatureGS: Exaggerating 3D Gaussian Splatting Faces With Gaussian Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A photorealistic and controllable 3D caricaturization framework for faces is introduced. We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars.</description>

      <title>Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization for Efficient LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>Aligning Findings with Diagnosis: A Self-Consistent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Trustworthy Radiology Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>HEEGNet: Hyperbolic Embeddings for EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces facilitate direct communication with a computer, enabling promising applications in human-computer interactions. However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Bare-Metal Tensor Virtualization: Overcoming the Memory Wall in Edge-AI Inference on ARM64</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of &gt;60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03327v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU (Intersection Over Union) gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.</description>

      <title>MMErroR: A Benchmark for Erroneous Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io</description>

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Eye-Q: A Multilingual Benchmark for Visual Word Puzzle Solving and Image-to-Phrase Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.</description>

      <title>Tigrinya Number Verbalization: Rules, Algorithm, and Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic formalization of Tigrinya cardinal and ordinal number verbalization, addressing a gap in computational resources for the language. This work documents the canonical rules governing the expression of numerical values in spoken Tigrinya, including the conjunction system, scale words, and special cases for dates, times, and currency. We provide a formal algorithm for number-to-word conversion and release an open-source implementation. Evaluation of frontier large language models (LLMs) reveals significant gaps in their ability to accurately verbalize Tigrinya numbers, underscoring the need for explicit rule documentation. This work serves language modeling, speech synthesis, and accessibility applications targeting Tigrinya-speaking communities.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking LLMs Without Gradients or Priors: Effective and Transferable Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Adaptation of New-Generation LLMs using Legacy Clinical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.</description>

      <title>Spectral Archaeology: The Causal Topology of Model Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $\Delta\lambda_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Specialization: Unveiling the Domain-Invariant "Standing Committee" in Mixture-of-Experts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>MARVEL: A Multi Agent-based Research Validator and Enabler using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MARVEL (https://ligogpt.mit.edu/marvel), a locally deployable, open-source framework for domain-aware question answering and assisted scientific research. It is designed to address the increasing demands of a digital assistant for scientific groups that can read highly technical data, cite precisely, and operate within authenticated networks. MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants.</description>

      <title>Discriminating real and synthetic super-resolved audio samples using embedding-based classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in audio super-resolution (ADSR), producing perceptually convincing wideband audio from narrowband inputs. However, existing evaluations primarily rely on signal-level or perceptual metrics, leaving open the question of how closely the distributions of synthetic super-resolved and real wideband audio match. Here we address this problem by analyzing the separability of real and super-resolved audio in various embedding spaces. We consider both middle-band ($4\to 16$~kHz) and full-band ($16\to 48$~kHz) upsampling tasks for speech and music, training linear classifiers to distinguish real from synthetic samples based on multiple types of audio embeddings. Comparisons with objective metrics and subjective listening tests reveal that embedding-based classifiers achieve near-perfect separation, even when the generated audio attains high perceptual quality and state-of-the-art metric scores. This behavior is consistent across datasets and models, including recent diffusion-based approaches, highlighting a persistent gap between perceptual quality and true distributional fidelity in ADSR models.</description>

      <title>Grading Scale Impact on LLM-as-a-Judge: Human-LLM Alignment Is Highest on 0-5 Grading Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly operate inside markets and institutions where data, behavior, and incentives are endogenous. This paper develops an economic foundation for multi-agent learning by studying a principal-agent interaction in a Markov decision process with strategic externalities, where both the principal and the agent learn over time. We propose a two-phase incentive mechanism that first estimates implementable transfers and then uses them to steer long-run dynamics; under mild regret-based rationality and exploration conditions, the mechanism achieves sublinear social-welfare regret and thus asymptotically optimal welfare. Simulations illustrate how even coarse incentives can correct inefficient learning under stateful externalities, highlighting the necessity of incentive-aware design for safe and welfare-aligned AI in markets and insurance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have long enabled automated immediate feedback on student work when it is presented in a tightly structured format and when problems are very constrained, but reliably assessing free-form mathematical reasoning remains challenging.
  We present a system that processes free-form natural language input, handles a wide range of edge cases, and comments competently not only on the technical correctness of submitted proofs, but also on style and presentation issues. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to the evaluation of such a system, and show that by the metrics we evaluate, the quality of the feedback generated is comparable to that produced by human experts when assessing early undergraduate homework. We stress-test our system with a small set of more advanced and unusual questions, and report both significant gaps and encouraging successes in that more challenging setting.
  Our system uses large language models in a modular workflow. The workflow configuration is human-readable and editable without programming knowledge, and allows some intermediate steps to be precomputed or injected by the instructor.
  A version of our tool is deployed on the Imperial mathematics homework platform Lambdafeedback. We report also on the integration of our tool into this platform.</description>

      <title>An Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Domain Adaptation in Gaussian Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.</description>

      <title>FROST-Drive: Scalable and Efficient End-to-End Driving with a Frozen Vision Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.</description>

      <title>Content vs. Form: What Drives the Writing Score Gap Across Socioeconomic Backgrounds? A Generated Panel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit persistent gaps in test scores, gaps that can translate into unequal educational and labor-market outcomes later in life. In many assessments, performance reflects not only what students know, but also how effectively they can communicate that knowledge. This distinction is especially salient in writing assessments, where scores jointly reward the substance of students' ideas and the way those ideas are expressed. As a result, observed score gaps may conflate differences in underlying content with differences in expressive skill. A central question, therefore, is how much of the socioeconomic-status (SES) gap in scores is driven by differences in what students say versus how they say it. We study this question using a large corpus of persuasive essays written by U.S. middle- and high-school students. We introduce a new measurement strategy that separates content from style by leveraging large language models to generate multiple stylistic variants of each essay. These rewrites preserve the underlying arguments while systematically altering surface expression, creating a "generated panel" that introduces controlled within-essay variation in style. This approach allows us to decompose SES gaps in writing scores into contributions from content and style. We find an SES gap of 0.67 points on a 1-6 scale. Approximately 69% of the gap is attributable to differences in essay content quality, Style differences account for 26% of the gap, and differences in evaluation standards across SES groups account for the remaining 5%. These patterns seems stable across demographic subgroups and writing tasks. More broadly, our approach shows how large language models can be used to generate controlled variation in observational data, enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the contributions of otherwise entangled factors.</description>

      <title>EpiQAL: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Epidemiological Question Answering for Enhanced Alignment and Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SegNSP: Revisiting Next Sentence Prediction for Linear Text Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.</description>

      <title>Online Decision-Making Under Uncertainty for Vehicle-to-Building Systems</title>

Abstract: Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sequential Recommendation for Long Term User Interest Via Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed success of sequential modeling, generative recommender, and large language model for recommendation. Though the scaling law has been validated for sequential models, it showed inefficiency in computational capacity when considering real-world applications like recommendation, due to the non-linear(quadratic) increasing nature of the transformer model. To improve the efficiency of the sequential model, we introduced a novel approach to sequential recommendation that leverages personalization techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. Our method could be applied to existing transformer based recommendation models, e.g., HSTU and HLLM. Extensive experiments on multiple sequential models demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness.

      <title>CroBIM-U: Uncertainty-Driven Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.</description>

      <title>Submodular Evaluation Subset Selection in Automatic Prompt Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization reduces manual prompt engineering, but relies on task performance measured on a small, often randomly sampled evaluation subset as its main source of feedback signal. Despite this, how to select that evaluation subset is usually treated as an implementation detail. We study evaluation subset selection for prompt optimization from a principled perspective and propose SESS, a submodular evaluation subset selection method. We frame selection as maximizing an objective set function and show that, under mild conditions, it is monotone and submodular, enabling greedy selection with theoretical guarantees. Across GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA-Diamond, submodularly selected evaluation subsets can yield better optimized prompts than random or heuristic baselines.</description>

      <title>Cyberattack Detection in Virtualized Microgrids Using LightGBM and Knowledge-Distilled Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>SDCD: Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Perplexity: A Lightweight Benchmark for Knowledge Retention in Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging for Adaptive Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.</description>

      <title>IntroLM: Introspective Language Models via Prefilling-Time Self-Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Code Translation with Weighted Multilanguage Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code translation across multiple programming languages is essential yet challenging due to two vital obstacles: scarcity of parallel data paired with executable test oracles, and optimization imbalance when handling diverse language pairs. We propose BootTrans, a bootstrapping method that resolves both obstacles. Its key idea is to leverage the functional invariance and cross-lingual portability of test suites, adapting abundant pivot-language unit tests to serve as universal verification oracles for multilingual RL training. Our method introduces a dual-pool architecture with seed and exploration pools to progressively expand training data via execution-guided experience collection. Furthermore, we design a language-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically prioritizes harder translation directions based on relative performance across sibling languages, mitigating optimization imbalance. Extensive experiments on the HumanEval-X and TransCoder-Test benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline LLMs across all translation directions, with ablations validating the effectiveness of both bootstrapping and weighting components.</description>

Abstract: Open-source scientific software is abundant, yet most tools remain difficult to compile, configure, and reuse, sustaining a small-workshop mode of scientific computing. This deployment bottleneck limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluation, and the practical integration of scientific tools into modern AI-for-Science (AI4S) and agentic workflows.
  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.
  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale. These results explain why scientific software remains difficult to operationalize and motivate shared, observable execution substrates as a foundation for scalable AI4S and agentic science.</description>

      <title>Mem-Gallery: Benchmarking Multimodal Long-Term Conversational Memory for MLLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning-Based Model for Mapping and Goal-Directed Navigation Using Multiscale Place Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in complex and partially observable environments remains a central challenge in robotics. Several bio-inspired models of mapping and navigation based on place cells in the mammalian hippocampus have been proposed. This paper introduces a new robust model that employs parallel layers of place fields at multiple spatial scales, a replay-based reward mechanism, and dynamic scale fusion. Simulations show that the model improves path efficiency and accelerates learning compared to single-scale baselines, highlighting the value of multiscale spatial representations for adaptive robot navigation.</description>

      <title>VeRPO: Verifiable Dense Reward Policy Optimization for Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (&lt; 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.</description>

      <title>Layer-Order Inversion: Rethinking Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/laquabe/Layer-Order-Inversion.</description>

      <title>Value-Action Alignment in Large Language Models under Privacy-Prosocial Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLMs for Police Decision-Making: A Framework Based on Police Action Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.</description>

      <title>A Proposed Paradigm for Imputing Missing Multi-Sensor Data in the Healthcare Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.</description>

      <title>Deontic Knowledge Graphs for Privacy Compliance in Multimodal Disaster Data Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disaster response requires sharing heterogeneous artifacts, from tabular assistance records to UAS imagery, under overlapping privacy mandates. Operational systems often reduce compliance to binary access control, which is brittle in time-critical workflows. We present a novel deontic knowledge graph-based framework that integrates a Disaster Management Knowledge Graph (DKG) with a Policy Knowledge Graph (PKG) derived from IoT-Reg and FEMA/DHS privacy drivers. Our release decision function supports three outcomes: Allow, Block, and Allow-with-Transform. The latter binds obligations to transforms and verifies post-transform compliance via provenance-linked derived artifacts; blocked requests are logged as semantic privacy incidents. Evaluation on a 5.1M-triple DKG with 316K images shows exact-match decision correctness, sub-second per-decision latency, and interactive query performance across both single-graph and federated workloads.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs See Without Pixels? Benchmarking Spatial Intelligence from Textual Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .</description>

      <title>From Chains to Graphs: Self-Structured Reasoning for General-Domain LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.</description>

      <title>ALERT: Zero-shot LLM Jailbreak Detection via Internal Discrepancy Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.</description>

      <title>Policy-Guided Search on Tree-of-Thoughts for Efficient Problem Solving with Bounded Language Model Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Investigation into respiratory sound classification for an imbalanced data set using hybrid LSTM-KAN architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respiratory sounds captured via auscultation contain critical clues for diagnosing pulmonary conditions. Automated classification of these sounds faces challenges due to subtle acoustic differences and severe class imbalance in clinical datasets. This study investigates respiratory sound classification with a focus on mitigating pronounced class imbalance. We propose a hybrid deep learning model that combines a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential feature encoding with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for classification. The model is integrated with a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline and targeted imbalance mitigation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a public respiratory sound database comprising six classes with a highly skewed distribution. Techniques such as focal loss, class-specific data augmentation, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were employed to enhance minority class recognition. The proposed Hybrid LSTM-KAN model achieves an overall accuracy of 94.6 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.703, despite the dominant COPD class accounting for over 86 percent of the data. Improved detection performance is observed for minority classes compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for imbalanced respiratory sound classification.</description>

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.</description>

      <title>ReStyle-TTS: Relative and Continuous Style Control for Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot text-to-speech models can clone a speaker's timbre from a short reference audio, but they also strongly inherit the speaking style present in the reference. As a result, synthesizing speech with a desired style often requires carefully selecting reference audio, which is impractical when only limited or mismatched references are available. While recent controllable TTS methods attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on absolute style targets and discrete textual prompts, and therefore do not support continuous and reference-relative style control. We propose ReStyle-TTS, a framework that enables continuous and reference-relative style control in zero-shot TTS. Our key insight is that effective style control requires first reducing the model's implicit dependence on reference style before introducing explicit control mechanisms. To this end, we introduce Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), which independently controls text and reference guidance, reducing reliance on reference style while preserving text fidelity. On top of this, we apply style-specific LoRAs together with Orthogonal LoRA Fusion to enable continuous and disentangled multi-attribute control, and introduce a Timbre Consistency Optimization module to mitigate timbre drift caused by weakened reference guidance. Experiments show that ReStyle-TTS enables user-friendly, continuous, and relative control over pitch, energy, and multiple emotions while maintaining intelligibility and speaker timbre, and performs robustly in challenging mismatched reference-target style scenarios.</description>

      <title>MFC-RFNet: A Multi-scale Guided Rectified Flow Network for Radar Sequence Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.</description>

      <title>ReLA: Representation Learning and Aggregation for Job Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03646v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>In Search of Grandmother Cells: Tracing Interpretable Neurons in Tabular Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.</description>

      <title>Group and Exclusive Sparse Regularization-based Continual Learning of CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a regularization-based approach for continual learning (CL) of fixed capacity convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially. This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>AMIR-GRPO: Inducing Implicit Preference Signals into GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.</description>

      <title>e5-omni: Explicit Cross-modal Alignment for Omni-modal Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin finite element operator network for solving non-smooth PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Operator Network (DG--FEONet), a data-free operator learning framework that combines the strengths of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with neural networks to solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous coefficients and non-smooth solutions. Unlike traditional operator learning models such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator, which require large paired datasets and often struggle near sharp features, our approach minimizes the residual of a DG-based weak formulation using the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme. DG-FEONet predicts element-wise solution coefficients via a neural network, enabling data-free training without the need for precomputed input-output pairs. We provide theoretical justification through convergence analysis and validate the model's performance on a series of one- and two-dimensional PDE problems, demonstrating accurate recovery of discontinuities, strong generalization across parameter space, and reliable convergence rates. Our results highlight the potential of combining local discretization schemes with machine learning to achieve robust, singularity-aware operator approximation in challenging PDE settings.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in Physics-Informed Neural Networks. Application to Insulation Material Degradation Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.</description>

      <title>Towards Compositional Generalization of LLMs via Skill Taxonomy Guided Data Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.</description>

      <title>From Implicit to Explicit: Token-Efficient Logical Supervision for Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Reaction Embedding Descriptor Capturing Bond Transformation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.</description>

      <title>Can AI Chatbots Provide Coaching in Engineering? Beyond Information Processing Toward Mastery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education.</description>

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.</description>

      <title>Inference Attacks Against Graph Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

      <title>TreeAdv: Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.</description>

      <title>Investigating Knowledge Distillation Through Neural Networks for Protein Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on code completion tasks in general-purpose programming languages. However, existing repository-level code completion benchmarks focus almost exclusively on software code and largely overlook hardware description languages. In this work, we present \textbf{MHRC-Bench}, consisting of \textbf{MHRC-Bench-Train} and \textbf{MHRC-Bench-Eval}, the first benchmark designed for multilingual hardware code completion at the repository level. Our benchmark targets completion tasks and covers three major hardware design coding styles. Each completion target is annotated with code-structure-level and hardware-oriented semantic labels derived from concrete syntax tree analysis. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of models on MHRC-Bench-Eval. Comprehensive evaluation results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of MHRC-Bench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence rapidly advances, society is increasingly captivated by promises of superhuman machines and seamless digital futures. Yet these visions often obscure mounting social, ethical, and psychological concerns tied to pervasive digital technologies - from surveillance to mental health crises. This article argues that a guiding ethos is urgently needed to navigate these transformations. Inspired by the lasting influence of the biblical Ten Commandments, a European interdisciplinary group has proposed "Ten Rules for the Digital World" - a novel ethical framework to help individuals and societies make prudent, human-centered decisions in the age of "supercharged" technology.</description>

      <title>R$^3$L: Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability.

      <title>CSMCIR: CoT-Enhanced Symmetric Alignment with Memory Bank for Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.</description>

      <title>From Laboratory to Real-World Applications: Benchmarking Agentic Code Reasoning at the Repository Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, evaluating repository-level reasoning, the ability to maintain logical consistency across massive, real-world, interdependent file systems, has become critical. Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.</description>

      <title>RadDiff: Describing Differences in Radiology Image Sets with Natural Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance gap between closed-source and open-source large language models (LLMs) is largely attributed to disparities in access to high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework for the automated synthesis of sophisticated, research-grade instructional data. Our approach centers on a multi-agent workflow where collaborative AI agents simulate complex tool-integrated reasoning to generate diverse and high-fidelity data end-to-end. Leveraging this synthesized data, we develop a two-stage training strategy that integrates supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning method, designed to maximize model alignment and capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework empowers open-source models across multiple scales, enabling them to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the major deep research benchmark. This work provides a scalable and effective pathway for advancing open-source LLMs without relying on proprietary data or models.</description>

      <title>Bridging OLAP and RAG: A Multidimensional Approach to the Design of Corpus Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Multilingual LLMs Personalized Text Generation Capabilities Targeting Groups and Social-Media Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.</description>

      <title>Learning Shrinks the Hard Tail: Training-Dependent Inference Scaling in a Solvable Linear Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-\beta_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $\beta_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $\beta$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.</description>

However, a fundamental reliance of these models on fixed-cutoff architectures limits their applicability to macromolecular systems where long-range interactions dominate. We demonstrate that this locality constraint causes force prediction errors to scale monotonically with system size, revealing a critical architectural bottleneck. To overcome this, we establish the systematically designed MolLR25 ({Mol}ecules with {L}ong-{R}ange effect) benchmark up to 1200 atoms, generated using high-fidelity DFT, and introduce E2Former-LSR, an equivariant transformer that explicitly integrates long-range attention blocks. E2Former-LSR exhibits stable error scaling, achieves superior fidelity in capturing non-covalent decay, and maintains precision on complex protein conformations. Crucially, its efficient design provides up to 30% speedup compared to purely local models. This work validates the necessity of non-local architectures for generalizable MLFFs, enabling high-fidelity molecular dynamics for large-scale chemical and biological systems.</description>

      <title>PointWorld: Scaling 3D World Models for In-The-Wild Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans anticipate, from a glance and a contemplated action of their bodies, how the 3D world will respond, a capability that is equally vital for robotic manipulation. We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

      <title>Membox: Weaving Topic Continuity into Long-Range Memory for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Criminal Liability of Generative Artificial Intelligence Providers for User-Generated Child Sexual Abuse Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of more powerful Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has expanded its capabilities and the variety of outputs. This has introduced significant legal challenges, including gray areas in various legal systems, such as the assessment of criminal liability for those responsible for these models. Therefore, we conducted a multidisciplinary study utilizing the statutory interpretation of relevant German laws, which, in conjunction with scenarios, provides a perspective on the different properties of GenAI in the context of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) generation. We found that generating CSAM with GenAI may have criminal and legal consequences not only for the user committing the primary offense but also for individuals responsible for the models, such as independent software developers, researchers, and company representatives. Additionally, the assessment of criminal liability may be affected by contextual and technical factors, including the type of generated image, content moderation policies, and the model's intended purpose. Based on our findings, we discussed the implications for different roles, as well as the requirements when developing such systems.</description>

      <title>NeoAMT: Neologism-Aware Agentic Machine Translation with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neologism-aware machine translation aims to translate source sentences containing neologisms into target languages. This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Really Memorize Personally Identifiable Information? Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Framework for Systematic Literature Reviews: A Case Study for Financial Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithmic framework for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLRs), designed to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and selection quality assessment in the literature review process. The proposed method integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools to automate and structure the selection and analysis of academic publications. The framework is applied to a case study focused on financial narratives, an emerging area in financial economics that examines how structured accounts of economic events, formed by the convergence of individual interpretations, influence market dynamics and asset prices. Drawing from the Scopus database of peer-reviewed literature, the review highlights research efforts to model financial narratives using various NLP techniques. Results reveal that while advances have been made, the conceptualization of financial narratives remains fragmented, often reduced to sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or their combination, without a unified theoretical framework. The findings underscore the value of more rigorous and dynamic narrative modeling approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic SLR methodology.</description>

      <title>Where meaning lives: Layer-wise accessibility of psycholinguistic features in encoder and decoder language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.</description>

      <title>AI Generated Text Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.</description>

      <title>IDESplat: Iterative Depth Probability Estimation for Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.</description>

      <title>On the Trap Space Semantics of Normal Logic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logical semantics of normal logic programs has traditionally been based on the notions of Clark's completion and two-valued or three-valued canonical models, including supported, stable, regular, and well-founded models. Two-valued interpretations can also be seen as states evolving under a program's update operator, producing a transition graph whose fixed points and cycles capture stable and oscillatory behaviors, respectively. We refer to this view as dynamical semantics since it characterizes the program's meaning in terms of state-space trajectories, as first introduced in the stable (supported) class semantics. Recently, we have established a formal connection between Datalog^\neg programs (i.e., normal logic programs without function symbols) and Boolean networks, leading to the introduction of the trap space concept for Datalog^\neg programs. In this paper, we generalize the trap space concept to arbitrary normal logic programs, introducing trap space semantics as a new approach to their interpretation. This new semantics admits both model-theoretic and dynamical characterizations, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding program behavior. We establish the foundational properties of the trap space semantics and systematically relate it to the established model-theoretic semantics, including the stable (supported), stable (supported) partial, regular, and L-stable model semantics, as well as to the dynamical stable (supported) class semantics. Our results demonstrate that the trap space semantics offers a unified and precise framework for proving the existence of supported classes, strict stable (supported) classes, and regular models, in addition to uncovering and formalizing deeper relationships among the existing semantics of normal logic programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present automated theorem provers for the first-order logic of here and there (HT). They are based on a native sequent calculus for the logic of HT and an axiomatic embedding of the logic of HT into intuitionistic logic. The analytic proof search in the sequent calculus is optimized by using free variables and skolemization. The embedding is used in combination with sequent, tableau and connection calculi for intuitionistic first-order logic. All provers are evaluated on a large benchmark set of first-order formulas, providing a foundation for the development of more efficient HT provers.

      <title>What Matters For Safety Alignment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.</description>

      <title>Women Worry, Men Adopt: How Gendered Perceptions Shape the Use of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is diffusing rapidly, yet its adoption is strikingly unequal. Using nationally representative UK survey data from 2023 to 2024, we show that women adopt GenAI substantially less often than men because they perceive its societal risks differently. We construct a composite index capturing concerns about mental health, privacy, climate impact, and labor market disruption. This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points. Using a synthetic twin panel design, we show that increased optimism about AI's societal impact raises GenAI use among young women from 13 percent to 33 percent, substantially narrowing the gender divide. These findings indicate that gendered perceptions of AI's social and ethical consequences, rather than access or capability, are the primary drivers of unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill formation, and economic inequality in an AI enabled economy.</description>

      <title>FLNet: Flood-Induced Agriculture Damage Assessment using Super Resolution of Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.</description>

      <title>IndexTTS 2.5 Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03888v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prior work, we introduced IndexTTS 2, a zero-shot neural text-to-speech foundation model comprising two core components: a transformer-based Text-to-Semantic (T2S) module and a non-autoregressive Semantic-to-Mel (S2M) module, which together enable faithful emotion replication and establish the first autoregressive duration-controllable generative paradigm. Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.</description>

      <title>Spectral Manifold Regularization for Stable and Modular Routing in Deep MoE Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of neural networks but suffer from expert collapse, where routing converges to a few dominant experts. This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO: Ensuring Bounded Ratios for Stable and Generalizable Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Representation Theorem for Linear GENEOs in Geometric Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>A Gap Between Decision Trees and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03919v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when geometric simplicity of decision boundaries, used here as a notion of interpretability, can conflict with accurate approximation of axis-aligned decision trees by shallow neural networks. Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.
  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d&gt;1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.
  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $\tau=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.</description>

      <title>FocusUI: Efficient UI Grounding via Position-Preserving Visual Token Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.</description>

      <title>Bayes-PD: Exploring a Sequence to Binding Bayesian Neural Network model trained on Phage Display data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phage display is a powerful laboratory technique used to study the interactions between proteins and other molecules, whether other proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA. The under-utilisation of this data in conjunction with deep learning models for protein design may be attributed to; high experimental noise levels; the complex nature of data pre-processing; and difficulty interpreting these experimental results. In this work, we propose a novel approach utilising a Bayesian Neural Network within a training loop, in order to simulate the phage display experiment and its associated noise. Our goal is to investigate how understanding the experimental noise and model uncertainty can enable the reliable application of such models to reliably interpret phage display experiments. We validate our approach using actual binding affinity measurements instead of relying solely on proxy values derived from 'held-out' phage display rounds.</description>

      <title>FOREVER: Forgetting Curve-Inspired Memory Replay for Language Model Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.</description>

      <title>A Scheduling Framework for Efficient MoE Inference on Edge GPU-NDP Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models facilitate edge deployment by decoupling model capacity from active computation, yet their large memory footprint drives the need for GPU systems with near-data processing (NDP) capabilities that offload experts to dedicated processing units. However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>HoneyTrap: Deceiving Large Language Model Attackers to Honeypot Traps with Resilient Multi-Agent Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose significant threats to large language models (LLMs), enabling attackers to bypass safeguards. However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Mind the Generative Details: Direct Localized Detail Preference Optimization for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04068v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Reasoning Consistency in Large Multimodal Models under Cross-Modal Conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing code similarity metrics, such as BLEU, CodeBLEU, and TSED, largely rely on surface-level string overlap or abstract syntax tree structures, and often fail to capture deeper semantic relationships between programs.We propose CSSG (Code Similarity using Semantic Graphs), a novel metric that leverages program dependence graphs to explicitly model control dependencies and variable interactions, providing a semantics-aware representation of code.Experiments on the CodeContests+ dataset show that CSSG consistently outperforms existing metrics in distinguishing more similar code from less similar code under both monolingual and cross-lingual settings, demonstrating that dependency-aware graph representations offer a more effective alternative to surface-level or syntax-based similarity measures.</description>

      <title>Layer-wise Positional Bias in Short-Context Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models often show a preference for using information from specific positions in the input regardless of semantic relevance. While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Modules and Their Interactions in the PSO-X Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PSO-X framework incorporates dozens of modules that have been proposed for solving single-objective continuous optimization problems using particle swarm optimization. While modular frameworks enable users to automatically generate and configure algorithms tailored to specific optimization problems, the complexity of this process increases with the number of modules in the framework and the degrees of freedom defined for their interaction. Understanding how modules affect the performance of algorithms for different problems is critical to making the process of finding effective implementations more efficient and identifying promising areas for further investigation. Despite their practical applications and scientific relevance, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks and how they interact. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms instantiated from the PSO-X framework on the 25 functions in the CEC'05 benchmark suite with 10 and 30 dimensions. We use functional ANOVA to quantify the impact of modules and their combinations on performance in different problem classes. In practice, this allows us to identify which modules have greater influence on PSO-X performance depending on problem features such as multimodality, mathematical transformations and varying dimensionality. We then perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of problem classes that share similar module effect patterns. Our results show low variability in the importance of modules in all problem classes, suggesting that particle swarm optimization performance is driven by a few influential modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04126v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GUI agents that interact with graphical interfaces on behalf of users represent a promising direction for practical AI assistants. However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.</description>

      <title>Pixel-Wise Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

      <title>ContextFocus: Activation Steering for Contextual Faithfulness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>Wow, wo, val! A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (&gt;0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.</description>

      <title>Klear: Unified Multi-Task Audio-Video Joint Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.</description>

      <title>Clinical Data Goes MEDS? Let's OWL make sense of it</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.</description>

Abstract: Although AI has become increasingly smart, its wisdom has not kept pace. In this article, we examine what is known about human wisdom and sketch a vision of its AI counterpart. We analyze human wisdom as a set of strategies for solving intractable problems-those outside the scope of analytic techniques-including both object-level strategies like heuristics [for managing problems] and metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, or context-adaptability [for managing object-level strategies]. We argue that AI systems particularly struggle with metacognition; improved metacognition would lead to AI more robust to novel environments, explainable to users, cooperative with others, and safer in risking fewer misaligned goals with human users. We discuss how wise AI might be benchmarked, trained, and implemented.</description>

      <title>VERUS-LM: a Versatile Framework for Combining LLMs with Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to similar state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems.</description>

      <title>SPIO: Ensemble and Selective Strategies via LLM-Based Multi-Agent Planning in Automated Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled dynamic reasoning in automated data analytics, yet recent multi-agent systems remain limited by rigid, single-path workflows that restrict strategic exploration and often lead to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a framework that replaces rigid workflows with adaptive, multi-path planning across four core modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, specialized agents generate diverse candidate strategies, which are cascaded and refined by an optimization agent. SPIO offers two operating modes: SPIO-S for selecting a single optimal pipeline, and SPIO-E for ensembling top-k pipelines to maximize robustness. Extensive evaluations on Kaggle and OpenML benchmarks show that SPIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 5.6%. By explicitly exploring and integrating multiple solution paths, SPIO delivers a more flexible, accurate, and reliable foundation for automated data science.</description>

      <title>Beyond Chemical QA: Evaluating LLM's Chemical Reasoning with Modular Chemical Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a Conditional Answer Set Programming framework (Conditional ASP) for the definition of conditional extensions of Answer Set Programming (ASP). The approach builds on a conditional logic with typicality, and on the combination of a conditional knowledge base with an ASP program, and allows for conditional reasoning over the answer sets of the program. The formalism relies on a multi-preferential semantics, and on the KLM preferential semantics, as a special case. Conditional entailment is encoded in ASP and a complexity upper-bound is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design principles of a nurse scheduling system built using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and successfully deployed at the University of Yamanashi Hospital. Nurse scheduling is a complex optimization problem requiring the reconciliation of individual nurse preferences with hospital staffing needs across various wards. This involves balancing hard and soft constraints and the flexibility of interactive adjustments. While extensively studied in academia, real-world nurse scheduling presents unique challenges that go beyond typical benchmark problems and competitions. This paper details the practical application of ASP to address these challenges at the University of Yamanashi Hospital, focusing on the insights gained and the advancements in ASP technology necessary to effectively manage the complexities of real-world deployment.

      <title>Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning Models Using FOLD-R++ and Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical reveal statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy

      <title>An ASP-Based Framework for MUSes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>League of LLMs: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities across a wide range of tasks, reliable evaluation remains a critical challenge due to data contamination, opaque operation, and subjective preferences. To address these issues, we propose League of LLMs (LOL), a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm that organizes multiple LLMs into a self-governed league for multi-round mutual evaluation. LOL integrates four core criteria (dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional) to mitigate key limitations of existing paradigms. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs in mathematics and programming demonstrate that LOL can effectively distinguish LLM capabilities while maintaining high internal ranking stability (Top-$k$ consistency $= 70.7\%$). Beyond ranking, LOL reveals empirical findings that are difficult for traditional paradigms to capture. For instance, ``memorization-based answering'' behaviors are observed in some models, and a statistically significant homophily bias is found within the OpenAI family ($\Delta = 9$, $p &lt; 0.05$). Finally, we make our framework and code publicly available as a valuable complement to the current LLM evaluation ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface, where adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. The proposed attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even against prompt-level defenses, auditor-based detection, and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface. Notably, AMA is orthogonal to injection attacks and can be combined with them to achieve stronger attack efficacy, highlighting the need for execution-level defenses beyond prompt-level and auditor-based mechanisms.

      <title>Answering the Unanswerable Is to Err Knowingly: Analyzing and Mitigating Abstention Failures in Large Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance.</description>

      <title>D-Artemis: A Deliberative Cognitive Framework for Mobile GUI Multi-Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard paradigm for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences. To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture the full complexity of realistic preference structures. This work introduces Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an n-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model. We demonstrate that MNPO inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures. Comprehensive empirical evaluation shows that MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description>

      <title>DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced reasoning skills in language models, contemporary studies have documented training plateaus after thousands of optimization steps, i.e., notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models, while using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged computation.</description>

      <title>ChartAgent: A Multimodal Agent for Visually Grounded Reasoning in Complex Chart Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts-those requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations, cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask. This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07% absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries. Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse chart types, (b) achieves the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using tool-augmented multimodal agents.</description>

      <title>When Identity Skews Debate: Anonymization for Bias-Reduced Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions. Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias and improving trustworthiness. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled bias metric that measures an agent's tendency to follow its peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than identity. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.</description>

      <title>ELAIPBench: A Benchmark for Expert-Level Artificial Intelligence Paper Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI) research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic papers.</description>

      <title>Better Call CLAUSE: A Discrepancy Benchmark for Auditing LLMs Legal Reasoning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into high-stakes legal work has exposed a critical gap: no benchmark exists to systematically stress-test their reliability against the nuanced, adversarial, and often subtle flaws present in real-world contracts. To address this, we introduce CLAUSE, a first-of-its-kind benchmark designed to evaluate the fragility of an LLM's legal reasoning. We study the capabilities of LLMs to detect and reason about fine-grained discrepancies by producing over 7500 real-world perturbed contracts from foundational datasets like CUAD and ContractNLI. Our novel, persona-driven pipeline generates 10 distinct anomaly categories, which are then validated against official statutes using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to ensure legal fidelity. We use CLAUSE to evaluate leading LLMs' ability to detect embedded legal flaws and explain their significance. Our analysis shows a key weakness: these models often miss subtle errors and struggle even more to justify them legally. Our work outlines a path to identify and correct such reasoning failures in legal AI.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought as a Lens: Evaluating Structured Reasoning Alignment between Human Preferences and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily demonstrate a method to quantitatively assess the alignment between multi-step, structured reasoning in large language models and human preferences. We introduce the Alignment Score, a semantic-level metric that compares a model-produced chain of thought traces with a human-preferred reference by constructing semantic-entropy-based matrices over intermediate steps and measuring their divergence. Our analysis shows that Alignment Score tracks task accuracy across models and hop depths, and peaks at 2-hop reasoning. Empirical results further indicates that misalignment at greater reasoning depths is driven mainly by alignment errors such as thematic shift and redundant reasoning. Viewing chain sampling as drawing from a distribution over reasoning paths, we empirically demonstrate a strong and consistent correlation between Alignment Score and accuracy performance, supporting its use as a meaningful diagnostic signal for structured reasoning.</description>

      <title>Faithful-First Reasoning, Planning, and Acting for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from unfaithfulness, generating reasoning chains that drift from visual evidence or contradict final predictions. We propose Faithful-First Reasoning, Planning, and Acting (RPA) framework in which FaithEvi provides step-wise and chain-level supervision by evaluating the faithfulness of intermediate reasoning, and FaithAct uses these signals to plan and execute faithfulness-aware actions during inference. Experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that faithful-first RPA improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 24% over prompt-based and tool-augmented reasoning frameworks, without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle perceptually faithful reasoning trajectories and mitigates hallucination behavior. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Boosting In-Silicon Directed Evolution with Fine-Tuned Protein Language Model and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. Recent advances in protein language models have shown rich evolutionary patterns, offering unprecedented potential for in-silicon directed evolution. However, existing directed evolution methods largely rely on heuristic evolution strategies and have yet to efficiently integrate the transformative protein language models with advanced optimization techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to adaptively learn superior evolution policies. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework that evolves protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models, such as fine-tuning and test-time inference. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility of the interested protein family. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. A case study further demonstrates that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space of avGFP through computational evolution.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration Achieves Deterministic, High-Quality Decision Support for Incident Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.</description>

      <title>Navigating Taxonomic Expansions of Entity Sets Driven by Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing similarities among entities is central to both human cognition and computational intelligence. Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.</description>

Abstract: We present the development and optimization of PayPal's Commerce Agent, powered by NEMO-4-PAYPAL, a multi-agent system designed to revolutionize agentic commerce on the PayPal platform. Through our strategic partnership with NVIDIA, we leveraged the NeMo Framework for LLM model fine-tuning to enhance agent performance. Specifically, we optimized the Search and Discovery agent by replacing our base model with a fine-tuned Nemotron small language model (SLM).
  We conducted comprehensive experiments using the llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture, training LoRA-based models through systematic hyperparameter sweeps across learning rates, optimizers (Adam, AdamW), cosine annealing schedules, and LoRA ranks. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.</description>

      <title>MindWatcher: Toward Smarter Multimodal Tool-Integrated Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional workflow-based agents exhibit limited intelligence when addressing real-world problems requiring tool invocation. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.</description>

Abstract: As agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) advance, improving the task performance of an autonomous agent, especially in context understanding, tool usage, and response generation, has become increasingly critical. Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius (https://www.jenius.cn), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.</description>

Abstract: Pharmaceutical three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced fabrication technology with the potential to enable truly personalised dosage forms. Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.</description>

      <title>HAL: Inducing Human-likeness in LLMs with Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Representation Bottleneck of Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07266v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) rely mainly on the message-passing paradigm to propagate node features and build interactions, and different graph learning problems require different ranges of node interactions. In this work, we explore the capacity of GNNs to capture node interactions under contexts of different complexities. We discover that GNNs usually fail to capture the most informative kinds of interaction styles for diverse graph learning tasks, and thus name this phenomenon GNNs' representation bottleneck. As a response, we demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by existing graph construction mechanisms can result in this representation bottleneck, \emph{i.e.}, preventing GNNs from learning interactions of the most appropriate complexity. To address that limitation, we propose a novel graph rewiring approach based on interaction patterns learned by GNNs to dynamically adjust each node's receptive fields. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets prove the effectiveness of our algorithm in alleviating the representation bottleneck and its superiority in enhancing the performance of GNNs over state-of-the-art graph rewiring baselines.</description>

      <title>Instructor-inspired Machine Learning for Robust Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning catalyzes a revolution in chemical and biological science. However, its efficacy heavily depends on the availability of labeled data, and annotating biochemical data is extremely laborious. To surmount this data sparsity challenge, we present an instructive learning algorithm named InstructMol to measure pseudo-labels' reliability and help the target model leverage large-scale unlabeled data. InstructMol does not require transferring knowledge between multiple domains, which avoids the potential gap between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. We demonstrated the high accuracy of InstructMol on several real-world molecular datasets and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. Code is available at~ https://github.com/smiles724/InstructMol.</description>

      <title>Computing Universal Plans for Partially Observable Multi-Agent Routing Using Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent routing problems have gained significant attention recently due to their wide range of industrial applications, ranging from logistics warehouse automation to indoor service robots. Conventionally, they are modeled as classical planning problems. In this paper, we argue that it can be beneficial to formulate them as universal planning problems, particularly when the agents are autonomous entities and may encounter unforeseen situations. We therefore propose universal plans, also known as policies, as the solution concept, and implement a system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) to compute them. Given an arbitrary two-dimensional map and a profile of goals for a group of partially observable agents, the system translates the problem configuration into logic programs and finds a feasible universal plan for each agent, mapping its observations to actions while ensuring that there are no collisions with other agents. We use the system to conduct experiments and obtain findings regarding the types of goal profiles and environments that lead to feasible policies, as well as how feasibility may depend on the agents' sensors. We also demonstrate how users can customize action preferences to compute more efficient policies, even (near-)optimal ones. The code is available at https://github.com/Fernadoo/MAPF_ASP.</description>

      <title>Towards the Terminator Economy: Assessing Job Exposure to AI through LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI and related technologies are reshaping jobs and tasks, either by automating or augmenting human skills in the workplace. Many researchers have been working on estimating if and to what extent jobs and tasks are exposed to the risk of being automatized by AI-related technologies. Our work tackles this issue through a data-driven approach by: (i) developing a reproducible framework that uses cutting-edge open-source large language models to assess the current capabilities of AI and robotics in performing job-related tasks; (ii) formalizing and computing a measure of AI exposure by occupation, the Task Exposure to AI (TEAI) index, and a measure of Task Replacement by AI (TRAI), both validated through a human user evaluation and compared with the state of the art.
  Our results show that the TEAI index is positively correlated with cognitive, problem-solving and management skills, while it is negatively correlated with social skills. Applying the index to the US, we obtain that about one-third of US employment is highly exposed to AI, primarily in high-skill jobs requiring a graduate or postgraduate level of education. We also find that AI exposure is positively associated with both employment and wage growth in 2003-2023, suggesting that AI has an overall positive effect on productivity.
  Considering specifically the TRAI index, we find that even in high-skill occupations, AI exhibits high variability in task substitution, suggesting that AI and humans complement each other within the same occupation, while the allocation of tasks within occupations is likely to change.
  All results, models, and code are freely available online to allow the community to reproduce our results, compare outcomes, and use our work as a benchmark to monitor AI's progress over time.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Comparison between Extractive Self-Explanations and Human Rationales in Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned LLMs are able to provide \textit{an} explanation about their output to users by generating self-explanations, without requiring the application of complex interpretability techniques. In this paper, we analyse whether this ability results in a \textit{good} explanation. We evaluate self-explanations in the form of input rationales with respect to their plausibility to humans. We study three text classification tasks: sentiment classification, forced labour detection and claim verification. We include Danish and Italian translations of the sentiment classification task and compare self-explanations to human annotations. For this, we collected human rationale annotations for Climate-Fever, a claim verification dataset. We furthermore evaluate the faithfulness of human and self-explanation rationales with respect to correct model predictions, and extend the study by incorporating post-hoc attribution-based explanations. We analyse four open-weight LLMs and find that alignment between self-explanations and human rationales highly depends on text length and task complexity. Nevertheless, self-explanations yield faithful subsets of token-level rationales, whereas post-hoc attribution methods tend to emphasize structural and formatting tokens, reflecting fundamentally different explanation strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prototypical part networks offer interpretable alternatives to black-box deep learning models by learning visual prototypes for classification. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of prototype formulations, comparing point-based and probabilistic approaches in both Euclidean and hyperspherical latent spaces.
  We introduce HyperPG, a probabilistic prototype representation using Gaussian distributions on hyperspheres. Experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and Oxford Flowers datasets show that hyperspherical prototypes outperform standard Euclidean formulations. Critically, hyperspherical prototypes maintain competitive performance under simplified training schemes, while Euclidean prototypes require extensive hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>SSSD: Simply-Scalable Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding has emerged as a popular technique for accelerating inference in Large Language Models. However, most existing approaches yield only modest improvements in production serving systems. Methods that achieve substantial speedups typically rely on an additional trained draft model or auxiliary model components, increasing deployment and maintenance complexity. This added complexity reduces flexibility, particularly when serving workloads shift to tasks, domains, or languages that are not well represented in the draft model's training data.
  We introduce Simply-Scalable Speculative Decoding (SSSD), a training-free method that combines lightweight n-gram matching with hardware-aware speculation. Relative to standard autoregressive decoding, SSSD reduces latency by up to 2.9x. It achieves performance on par with leading training-based approaches across a broad range of benchmarks, while requiring substantially lower adoption effort--no data preparation, training or tuning are needed--and exhibiting superior robustness under language and domain shift, as well as in long-context settings.</description>

      <title>Exploring Iterative Controllable Summarization with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in abstractive summarization tasks. However, their ability to precisely control summary attributes (e.g., length or topic) remains underexplored, limiting their adaptability to specific user preferences. In this paper, we systematically explore the controllability of LLMs. To this end, we revisit summary attribute measurements and introduce iterative evaluation metrics, failure rate and average iteration count to precisely evaluate controllability of LLMs, rather than merely assessing errors. Our findings show that LLMs struggle more with numerical attributes than with linguistic attributes. To address this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for controllable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify misaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in self-explaining errors in the previous output. By allowing the model to reflect on its misalignment, GTE generates well-adjusted summaries that satisfy the desired attributes with robust effectiveness, requiring surprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative approaches.</description>

      <title>FedDUAL: A Dual-Strategy with Adaptive Loss and Dynamic Aggregation for Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) marks a transformative approach to distributed model training by combining locally optimized models from various clients into a unified global model. While FL preserves data privacy by eliminating centralized storage, it encounters significant challenges such as performance degradation, slower convergence, and reduced robustness of the global model due to the heterogeneity in client data distributions. Among the various forms of data heterogeneity, label skew emerges as a particularly formidable and prevalent issue, especially in domains such as image classification. To address these challenges, we begin with comprehensive experiments to pinpoint the underlying issues in the FL training process. Based on our findings, we then introduce an innovative dual-strategy approach designed to effectively resolve these issues. First, we introduce an adaptive loss function for client-side training, meticulously crafted to preserve previously acquired knowledge while maintaining an optimal equilibrium between local optimization and global model coherence. Secondly, we develop a dynamic aggregation strategy for aggregating client models at the server. This approach adapts to each client's unique learning patterns, effectively addressing the challenges of diverse data across the network. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across three diverse real-world datasets, coupled with theoretical convergence guarantees, demonstrates the superior efficacy of our method compared to several established state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent foundational models for tabular data, such as TabPFN, excel at adapting to new tasks via in-context learning, but remain constrained to a fixed, pre-defined number of target dimensions-often necessitating costly ensembling strategies. We trace this constraint to a deeper architectural shortcoming: these models lack target equivariance, so that permuting target dimension orderings alters their predictions. This deficiency gives rise to an irreducible "equivariance gap", an error term that introduces instability in predictions. We eliminate this gap by designing a fully target-equivariant architecture-ensuring permutation invariance via equivariant encoders, decoders, and a bi-attention mechanism. Empirical evaluation on standard classification benchmarks shows that, on datasets with more classes than those seen during pre-training, our model matches or surpasses existing methods while incurring lower computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Marking Code Without Breaking It: Code Watermarking for Detecting LLM-Generated Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying LLM-generated code through watermarking poses a challenge in preserving functional correctness. Previous methods rely on the assumption that watermarking high-entropy tokens effectively maintains output quality. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of this assumption: syntax-critical tokens such as keywords often exhibit the highest entropy, making existing approaches vulnerable to logic corruption. We present STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntactic tokens and preserves code integrity. For its rigorous assessment, we also introduce STEM, a comprehensive framework that balances three critical dimensions: correctness, detectability, and imperceptibility. Across Python, C++, and Java, STONE preserves correctness, sustains strong detectability, and achieves balanced performance with minimal overhead. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STONE-watermarking-AB4B/.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Data Generation for Contact-Rich Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a low-cost data generation pipeline that integrates physics-based simulation, human demonstrations, and model-based planning to efficiently generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

      <title>Brain-Inspired Exploration of Functional Networks and Key Neurons in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked significant interest among researchers to understand their mechanisms and functional characteristics. Although prior studies have attempted to explain LLM functionalities by identifying and interpreting specific neurons, these efforts mostly focus on individual neuron contributions, neglecting the fact that human brain functions are realized through intricate interaction networks. Inspired by research on functional brain networks (FBNs) in the field of neuroscience, we utilize similar methodologies estabilished in FBN analysis to explore the "functional networks" within LLMs in this study. Experimental results highlight that, much like the human brain, LLMs exhibit certain functional networks that recur frequently during their operation. Further investigation reveals that these functional networks are indispensable for LLM performance. Inhibiting key functional networks severely impairs the model's capabilities. Conversely, amplifying the activity of neurons within these networks can enhance either the model's overall performance or its performance on specific tasks. This suggests that these functional networks are strongly associated with either specific tasks or the overall performance of the LLM.

      <title>Detecting PTSD in Clinical Interviews: A Comparative Analysis of NLP Methods and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains underdiagnosed in clinical settings, presenting opportunities for automated detection to identify patients. This study evaluates natural language processing approaches for detecting PTSD from clinical interview transcripts. We compared general and mental health-specific transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa), embedding-based methods (SentenceBERT/LLaMA), and large language model prompting strategies (zero-shot/few-shot/chain-of-thought) using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Domain-specific end-to-end models significantly outperformed general models (Mental-RoBERTa AUPRC=0.675+/-0.084 vs. RoBERTa-base 0.599+/-0.145). SentenceBERT embeddings with neural networks achieved the highest overall performance (AUPRC=0.758+/-0.128). Few-shot prompting using DSM-5 criteria yielded competitive results with two examples (AUPRC=0.737). Performance varied significantly across symptom severity and comorbidity status with depression, with higher accuracy for severe PTSD cases and patients with comorbid depression. Our findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted embeddings and LLMs for scalable screening while underscoring the need for improved detection of nuanced presentations and offering insights for developing clinically viable AI tools for PTSD assessment.</description>

      <title>Architecture independent generalization bounds for overparametrized deep ReLU networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove a uniform generalization bound that is independent of the network architecture. We perform computational experiments of our theoretical results with MNIST, and obtain agreement with the true test error within a 22 % margin on average.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Robotic World Model Makes Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Work on Real Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive results in robotics, yet high-performing pipelines remain highly task-specific, with little reuse of prior data. Offline Model-based RL (MBRL) offers greater data efficiency by training policies entirely from existing datasets, but suffers from compounding errors and distribution shift in long-horizon rollouts. Although existing methods have shown success in controlled simulation benchmarks, robustly applying them to the noisy, biased, and partially observed datasets typical of real-world robotics remains challenging. We present a principled pipeline for making offline MBRL effective on physical robots. Our RWM-U extends autoregressive world models with epistemic uncertainty estimation, enabling temporally consistent multi-step rollouts with uncertainty effectively propagated over long horizons. We combine RWM-U with MOPO-PPO, which adapts uncertainty-penalized policy optimization to the stable, on-policy PPO framework for real-world control. We evaluate our approach on diverse manipulation and locomotion tasks in simulation and on real quadruped and humanoid, training policies entirely from offline datasets. The resulting policies consistently outperform model-free and uncertainty-unaware model-based baselines, and fusing real-world data in model learning further yields robust policies that surpass online model-free baselines trained solely in simulation.</description>

      <title>S2Vec: Self-Supervised Geospatial Embeddings for the Built Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate S2Vec on several large-scale geospatial prediction tasks, both random train/test splits (interpolation) and zero-shot geographic adaptation (extrapolation). Our experiments show S2Vec's competitive performance against several baselines on socioeconomic tasks, especially the geographic adaptation variant, with room for improvement on environmental tasks. We also explore combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve performance. Our findings highlight how S2Vec can learn effective general-purpose geospatial representations of the built environment features it is provided, and how it can complement other data modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>SPD Matrix Learning for Neuroimaging Analysis: Perspectives, Methods, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroimaging provides essential tools for characterizing brain activity by quantifying connectivity strength between remote regions, using different modalities that capture different aspects of connectivity. Yet, decoding meaningful neural signatures must contend with modality-specific challenges, including measurement noise, spatial and temporal distortions, heterogeneous acquisition protocols, and limited sample sizes. A unifying perspective emerges when these data are expressed through symmetric positive definite (SPD)-valued representations: across neuroimaging modalities, SPD-valued representations naturally give rise to SPD matrices that capture dependencies between sensors or brain regions. Endowing the SPD space with Riemannian metrics equips it with a non-Euclidean geometric structure, enabling principled statistical modeling and machine learning on the resulting manifold.
  This review consolidates machine learning methodologies that operate on the SPD manifold under a unified framework termed SPD matrix learning. SPD matrix learning brings conceptual clarity across multiple modalities, establishes continuity with decades of geometric statistics in neuroimaging, and positions SPD modeling as a methodological bridge between classical analysis and emerging AI-driven paradigms. We show that (i) modeling on the SPD manifold is mathematically natural and numerically stable, preserving symmetry and positive definiteness while avoiding degeneracies inherent to Euclidean embeddings; (ii) SPD matrix learning extends a broad family of established geometric statistical tools used across neuroimaging; and (iii) SPD matrix learning integrates new-generation AI technologies, driving a new class of neuroimaging problems that were previously out of reach. Taken together, SPD matrix learning offers a principled and forward-looking framework for next-generation neuroimaging analytics.</description>

      <title>VISTA: Mitigating Semantic Inertia in Video-LLMs via Training-Free Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have successfully transitioned towards System 2 reasoning, yet applying these paradigms to video understanding remains challenging. While prevailing research attributes failures in Video-LLMs to perceptual limitations, our empirical analysis reveals a cognitive misalignment termed Semantic Inertia, where models suppress valid visual evidence in favor of dominant language priors. To rectify this, we propose VISTA, a training-free framework designed to align perception with logical deduction. By dynamically routing inference paths and materializing implicit visual features into explicit textual anchors, our approach effectively counterbalances the influence of parametric knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate a Latent Reasoning Consensus mechanism to mitigate stochastic hallucinations. VISTA showed outstanding results on a wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary models. Our codebase will be publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Social Bias in Popular Question-Answering Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Question-answering (QA) and reading comprehension (RC) benchmarks are commonly used for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and reproduce knowledge. However, we demonstrate that popular QA and RC benchmarks do not cover questions about different demographics or regions in a representative way. We perform a content analysis of 30 benchmark papers and a quantitative analysis of 20 respective benchmark datasets to learn (1) who is involved in the benchmark creation, (2) whether the benchmarks exhibit social bias, or whether this is addressed or prevented, and (3) whether the demographics of the creators and annotators correspond to particular biases in the content. Most benchmark papers analyzed provide insufficient information about those involved in benchmark creation, particularly the annotators. Notably, just one (WinoGrande) explicitly reports measures taken to address social representation issues. Moreover, the data analysis revealed gender, religion, and geographic biases across a wide range of encyclopedic, commonsense, and scholarly benchmarks. Our work adds to the mounting criticism of AI evaluation practices and shines a light on biased benchmarks being a potential source of LLM bias by incentivizing biased inference heuristics.</description>

      <title>Shared Path: Unraveling Memorization in Multilingual LLMs through Language Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that the conventional focus on monolingual settings, effectively treating languages in isolation, may obscure the true patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages, those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled. These findings underscore the importance of a \textit{language-aware} perspective in evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad implications for multilingual NLP.</description>

      <title>FinTagging: Benchmarking LLMs for Extracting and Structuring Financial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of numerical data in financial reports is critical for markets and regulators. Although XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) provides a standard for tagging financial figures, mapping thousands of facts to over ten thousand US-GAAP concepts remains costly and error-prone. Existing benchmarks oversimplify this task as flat, single-step classification over small subsets of concepts, ignoring the hierarchical semantics of the taxonomy and the structured nature of financial documents. As a result, these benchmarks fail to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) under realistic reporting conditions. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure-aware and full-scope XBRL tagging. We decompose the complex tagging process into two subtasks: (1) FinNI (Financial Numeric Identification), which extracts entities and types from heterogeneous contexts such as text and tables; and (2) FinCL (Financial Concept Linking), which maps extracted entities to the full US-GAAP taxonomy. This two-stage formulation enables a fair assessment of LLM capabilities in numerical reasoning and taxonomy alignment. Evaluating diverse LLMs in zero-shot settings shows that while models generalize well in extraction, they struggle with fine-grained concept linking, revealing important limitations in domain-specific, structure-aware reasoning. Code is available on GitHub, and datasets are available on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Physics Reasoning in Small Language Models: A Multi-Dimensional Analysis from an Educational Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer privacy and efficiency for educational deployment, yet their utility depends on reliable multistep reasoning. Existing benchmarks often prioritize final answer accuracy, obscuring 'right answer, wrong procedure' failures that can reinforce student misconceptions. This work investigates SLM physics reasoning reliability, stage wise failure modes, and robustness under paired contextual variants. We introduce Physbench, comprising of 3,162 high school and AP level physics questions derived from OpenStax in a structured reference solution format with Bloom's Taxonomy annotations, plus 2,700 paired culturally contextualized variants. Using P-REFS, a stage wise evaluation rubric, we assess 10 SLMs across 58,000 responses. Results reveal substantial reliability gap: among final answer correct solutions, 75 to 98% contain at least one reasoning error. Failure modes shift with model capability; weaker models fail primarily at interpretation or modeling while stronger models often fail during execution. Paired contextual variations have minimal impact on top models but degrade the performance of mid-tier models. These findings demonstrate that safe educational AI requires evaluation paradigms that prioritize reasoning fidelity over final-answer correctness.</description>

      <title>Reward Is Enough: LLMs Are In-Context Reinforcement Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for solving sequential decision-making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, RL emerges during the inference time of large language models (LLMs), a phenomenon we term in-context RL (ICRL). To reveal this capability, we introduce a simple multi-round prompting framework, we call ICRL prompting, for inference-time self-improvement. The goal of ICRL prompting is to guide LLMs to perform reinforcement learning during inference for self-improvement on a given task. After each response, the model receives numerical scalar feedback, denoted as a reward. In the next round, we prompt the LLM again together with a context that concatenates all prior responses and their associated rewards. We consistently observe that response quality improves as the context grows. In other words, the LLM can optimize scalar reward signals during inference, exhibiting behavior analogous to reinforcement learning. We evaluate ICRL prompting on Game of 24, creative writing, ScienceWorld, and Olympiad-level math competitions (AIME and HMMT), demonstrating significant improvements over baselines such as Self-Refine and Reflexion. Notably, even when the reward signals are generated by the same LLM, ICRL prompting still improves performance, highlighting a promising new paradigm for test-time scaling.</description>

      <title>Task Matters: Knowledge Requirements Shape LLM Responses to Context-Memory Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) draw on both contextual information and parametric memory, yet these sources can conflict. Prior studies have largely examined this issue in contextual question answering, implicitly assuming that tasks should rely on the provided context, leaving unclear how LLMs behave when tasks require different types and degrees of knowledge utilization. We address this gap with a model-agnostic diagnostic framework that holds underlying knowledge constant while introducing controlled conflicts across tasks with varying knowledge demands. Experiments on representative open-source LLMs show that performance degradation under conflict is driven by both task-specific knowledge reliance and conflict plausibility; that strategies such as rationales or context reiteration increase context reliance, helping context-only tasks but harming those requiring parametric knowledge; and that these effects bias model-based evaluation, calling into question the reliability of LLMs as judges. Overall, our findings reveal that context-memory conflict is inherently task-dependent and motivate task-aware approaches to balancing context and memory in LLM deployment and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Improved LLM Agents for Financial Document Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Bias Paths with LLM-guided Causal Discovery: An Active Learning and Dynamic Scoring Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes like race or gender causally influence outcomes. Existing causal discovery (CD) methods often struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in the presence of noise, confounding, or data corruption. Large language models (LLMs) offer a complementary signal by leveraging semantic priors from variable metadata. We propose a hybrid LLM-guided CD framework that extends a breadth-first search strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for querying using a composite score combining mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, enabling more efficient and robust structure discovery. To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we introduce a semi-synthetic benchmark based on the UCI Adult dataset, embedding domain-informed bias pathways alongside noise and latent confounders. We assess how well CD methods recover both global graph structure and fairness-critical paths (e.g., sex--&gt;education--&gt;income). Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided methods, including our active, dynamically scored variant, outperform baselines in recovering fairness-relevant structure under noisy conditions. We analyze when LLM-driven insights complement statistical dependencies and discuss implications for fairness auditing in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Model Integration with Open World Temporal Logic for Process Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17776</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) have produced models that extract structured information from complex data. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable and explainable decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs of various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from a diverse set of ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model to enable decision-making in real-time. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables an analysis of time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes. This integration is well suited for use cases in numerous domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Content-Based Puzzle Solvers on Corrupted Jigsaw Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.</description>

      <title>Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, such as diffusion models, have raised concerns related to privacy, copyright infringement, and data stewardship. To better understand and control these risks, prior work has introduced techniques and attacks that reconstruct images, or parts of images, from training data. While these results demonstrate that training data can be recovered, existing methods often rely on high computational resources, partial access to the training set, or carefully engineered prompts.
  In this work, we present a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the training data, and identifies seemingly benign prompts that can lead to potentially risky image reconstruction. We further show that such reconstructions may occur unintentionally, even for users without specialized knowledge. For example, we observe that for one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' generates the face of a real individual. Moreover, by combining the identified vulnerabilities with real-world prompt data, we discover prompts that reproduce memorized visual elements.
  Our approach builds on insights from prior work and leverages domain knowledge to expose a fundamental vulnerability arising from the use of scraped e-commerce data, where templated layouts and images are closely tied to pattern-like textual prompts.
  The code for our attack is publicly available at https://github.com/TheSolY/lr-tmi.</description>

      <title>The Invisible Leash: Why RLVR May or May Not Escape Its Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows, leading to improved precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides new insights into the potential limits of the common RLVR recipe. We examine how, under current training conditions, RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely novel solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while the current RLVR recipe reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments show that although the current RLVR recipe consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, it leads to greater uncertainty at each generation step but declining answer-level entropy. This suggests that these seemingly more uncertain generation paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, our findings reveal potential limits of the current RLVR recipe in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations, such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that allocate probability mass to underrepresented solution regions.</description>

      <title>CNN-based Surface Temperature Forecasts with Ensemble Numerical Weather Prediction over Medium-range Forecast Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, a method that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models is proposed. This method enables surface temperature forecasting with lead times beyond the short-range, extending up to five days. Due to limited computational resources, operational medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models, which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations, the proposed method applies CNN-based post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) to an ensemble NWP system. First, the post-processing is applied to each ensemble member to reduce systematic errors and reconstruct high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution model outputs. This approach reduces the systematic and random errors in NWP model outputs and outperforms operational post-processing. Second, the CNN is applied to all ensemble members to construct a new ensemble forecasting system, in which deterministic forecast accuracy, probabilistic reliability, and representation of ensemble spread are improved compared with those of the original system. We demonstrate that this CNN-based post-processing is fundamentally different from the artificial error reduction caused by smoothing inherent in ensemble averaging because the post-processing reduces forecast errors without degrading the forecast information. These results indicate that the proposed method provides a practical and scalable solution for improving medium-range temperature forecasts and is particularly valuable for use in operational centers with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>LAG: Logic-Augmented Generation from a Cartesian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from \textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through systematic question decomposition, atomic memory bank and logic-aware reasoning. Specifically, LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise grounding in the logical chain. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that LAG significantly improves accuracy and reduces hallucination over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantization for Microcontrollers: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods, Platforms, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15008v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices, such as microcontrollers (MCUs), introduces fundamental challenges in balancing model performance, computational complexity, and memory constraints. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) addresses these issues by jointly advancing machine learning algorithms, hardware architectures, and software optimization techniques to enable deep neural network inference on embedded systems. This survey provides a hardware-oriented perspective on neural network quantization, systematically reviewing the quantization methods most relevant to MCUs and extreme-edge devices. Particular emphasis is placed on the critical trade-offs between model performance and the capabilities of MCU-class hardware, including memory hierarchies, numerical representations, and accelerator support. The survey further reviews contemporary MCU hardware platforms, including ARM-based and RISC-V-based designs, as well as MCUs integrating neural processing units (NPUs) for low-precision inference, together with the supporting software stacks. In addition, we analyze real-world deployments of quantized models on MCUs and consolidate the application domains in which such systems are used. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline promising future directions toward scalable, energy-efficient, and sustainable AI deployment on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Task-Stratified Knowledge Scaling Laws for Post-Training Quantized Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a critical strategy for efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) deployment. However, existing scaling laws primarily focus on general performance, overlooking crucial fine-grained factors and how quantization differentially impacts diverse knowledge capabilities. To address this, we establish Task-Stratified Knowledge Scaling Laws. By stratifying capabilities into memorization, application, and reasoning, we develop a framework that unifies model size, bit-width, and fine-grained factors: group size and calibration set size. Validated on 293 diverse PTQ configurations, our framework demonstrates strong fit and cross-architecture consistency. It reveals distinct sensitivities across knowledge capabilities: reasoning is precision-critical, application is scale-responsive, and memorization is calibration-sensitive. We highlight that in low-bit scenarios, optimizing these fine-grained factors is essential for preventing performance collapse. These findings provide an empirically-backed foundation for designing knowledge-aware quantization strategies.</description>

      <title>LFD: Layer Fused Decoding to Exploit External Knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.</description>

      <title>MyGO: Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation for Lifelong Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory, G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data ("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News) benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's effectiveness and domain-generality.</description>

      <title>Web Fraud Attacks Against LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern. Once MAS is induced to trust a malicious link, attackers can use it as a springboard to expand the attack surface. In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack manipulating unique structures of web links to deceive MAS. We design 12 representative attack variants that encompass various methods, such as homoglyph deception, sub-directory nesting, and parameter obfuscation. Through extensive experiments on these attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input design, lowering the threshold for attacks significantly. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks, providing new insights into MAS safety.

      <title>A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Evolutionary Optimization: From Modeling to Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08269v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess substantial reasoning capabilities and are increasingly applied to optimization tasks, particularly in synergy with evolutionary computation. However, while recent surveys have explored specific aspects of this domain, they lack an integrative perspective that connects problem modeling with solving workflows. To address this gap, we present a systematic review of recent developments and organize them within a structured framework. First, we classify existing research into two primary stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. Second, we divide the latter into three paradigms based on the role of the LLM: stand-alone optimizers, low-level components embedded within algorithms, and high-level managers for algorithm selection and generation. Third, for each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. Finally, we review interdisciplinary applications across the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. Based on this analysis, we highlight key limitations and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems.

      <title>OnlineMate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Companion System for Cognitive Support in Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which are crucial for cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have employed large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive learning environments, these interactions are limited to conversational exchanges, failing to adapt to learners' individualized cognitive and psychological states. As a result, students' engagement is low and they struggle to gain inspiration. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs integrated with Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate simulates peer-like roles, infers learners' psychological states such as misunderstandings and confusion during collaborative discussions, and dynamically adjusts interaction strategies to support higher-order thinking. Comprehensive evaluations, including simulation-based experiments, human assessments, and real classroom trials, demonstrate that OnlineMate significantly promotes deep learning and cognitive engagement by elevating students' average cognitive level while substantially improving emotional engagement scores.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation systems often suffer from a gap between optimizing retrieval relevance and generative utility. With such a gap, retrieved documents may be topically relevant but still lack the content needed for effective reasoning during generation. While existing bridge modules attempt to rewrite the retrieved text for better generation, we show how they fail by not capturing "document utility". In this work, we propose R2U, with a key distinction of approximating true utility through joint observation of rewriting and answering in the reasoning process. To distill, R2U scale such supervision to enhance reliability in distillation. We further construct utility-improvement supervision by measuring the generator's gain of the answer under the rewritten context, yielding signals for fine-tuning and preference optimization. We evaluate our method across multiple open-domain question-answering benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements over strong bridging baselines</description>

      <title>DyBBT: Dynamic Balance via Bandit inspired Targeting for Dialog Policy with Cognitive Dual-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task oriented dialog systems often rely on static exploration strategies that do not adapt to dynamic dialog contexts, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal performance. We propose DyBBT, a novel dialog policy learning framework that formalizes the exploration challenge through a structured cognitive state space capturing dialog progression, user uncertainty, and slot dependency. DyBBT proposes a bandit inspired meta-controller that dynamically switches between a fast intuitive inference (System 1) and a slow deliberative reasoner (System 2) based on real-time cognitive states and visitation counts. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-domain benchmarks show that DyBBT achieves state-of-the-art performance in success rate, efficiency, and generalization, with human evaluations confirming its decisions are well aligned with expert judgment.

      <title>HiCoLoRA: Addressing Context-Prompt Misalignment via Hierarchical Collaborative LoRA for Zero-Shot DST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this, we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization (SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.</description>

      <title>CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Time Series?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing time series in natural language, requires numeric and temporal reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on fully synthetic or generic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. We introduce \textbf{CaTS-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{a}ware \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries reasoning across $11$ diverse domains, centered on a gold-standard evaluation set of $1746$ human-rewritten captions that measure how effectively models translate numeric trends into immediately interpretable narratives. To address the scarcity of human-annotated data, we also propose a scalable pipeline for generating high-fidelity synthetic captions, the quality of which we validate. We evaluate leading Vision-Language Models on our benchmark, revealing that even proprietary models struggle to capture numeric nuances in temporal descriptions, while finetuning open-source models on synthetic data yields substantial performance gains. Finally, we release a diagnostic suite of $910$ multiple-choice questions and tailored numeric metrics to gauge time-series-specific reasoning capabilities, establishing CaTS-Bench as a reliable foundation for grounded, multimodal language generation in numeric domains.</description>

      <title>How Training Data Shapes the Use of Parametric and In-Context Knowledge in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models leverage not only parametric knowledge acquired during training but also in-context knowledge provided at inference time, despite the absence of explicit training objectives for using both sources. Prior work has further shown that when these knowledge sources conflict, models resolve the tension based on their internal confidence, preferring parametric knowledge for high-confidence facts while deferring to contextual information for less familiar ones. However, the training conditions that give rise to such knowledge utilization behaviors remain unclear. To address this gap, we conduct controlled experiments in which we train language models while systematically manipulating key properties of the training data. Our results reveal a counterintuitive finding: three properties commonly regarded as detrimental must co-occur for robust knowledge utilization and conflict resolution to emerge: (i) intra-document repetition of information, (ii) a moderate degree of within-document inconsistency, and (iii) a skewed knowledge frequency distribution. We further validate that the same training dynamics observed in our controlled setting also arise during real-world language model pretraining, and we analyze how post-training procedures can reshape models' knowledge preferences. Together, our findings provide concrete empirical guidance for training language models that harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Grading and Moderation for Collaborative Projects in Computer Science Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative group projects are integral to computer science education, as they foster teamwork, problem-solving skills, and industry-relevant competencies. However, assessing individual contributions in group settings has long been challenging. Traditional assessment strategies, such as the equal distribution of grades or subjective peer assessments, often fall short in terms of fairness, objectivity, and scalability, particularly in large classrooms. This paper introduces a semi-automated, AI-assisted grading system that evaluates both project quality and individual effort using repository mining, communication analytics, and machine learning models. The system comprises modules for project evaluation, contribution analysis, and grade computation, and integrates seamlessly with platforms such as GitHub. A pilot deployment in a senior-level course demonstrated high alignment with instructor assessments, increased student satisfaction, and reduced instructor grading effort. We conclude by discussing implementation considerations, ethical implications, and proposed enhancements to broaden applicability.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Computational Intelligence Framework with Metaheuristic Optimization for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance, studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Big Reasoning with Small Models: Instruction Retrieval at Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) enable low-cost, private, on-device inference, but they often fail on problems that require specialized domain knowledge or multi-step reasoning. Existing approaches for improving reasoning either rely on scale (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting), require task-specific training that limits reuse and generality (e.g., distillation), or retrieve unstructured information that still leaves the SLM to determine an appropriate reasoning strategy. We propose instruction retrieval, an inference-time intervention that augments an SLM with structured, reusable reasoning procedures rather than raw passages. We construct an Instruction Corpus by clustering similar training questions and using a teacher model to generate generalizable guides that pair domain background with explicit step-by-step procedures. At inference, the SLM retrieves the instructions most relevant to a given query and executes the associated procedures without any additional fine-tuning. Across three challenging domains: medicine, law, and mathematics, instruction retrieval yields consistent gains for models with at least 3B parameters, improving accuracy by 9.4%, 7.9%, and 5.1%, respectively, with the strongest 14B model surpassing GPT-4o's zero-shot performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.</description>

      <title>LiteStage: Latency-aware Layer Skipping for Multi-stage Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2) the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning. LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and StrategyQA, show that LiteStage outperforms prior training-free layer skipping methods.</description>

      <title>L-MoE: End-to-End Training of a Lightweight Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective, thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and specialized language models.</description>

      <title>User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted for tasks like drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In these settings, users may need to share private information (e.g., contact details, health records). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such information, prior work introduced real-life, scenario-based benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) and found that LLMs can leak private information in complex scenarios. However, these evaluations relied on proxy LLMs to judge the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses, rather than directly measuring users' perceptions. To understand how users perceive the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study ($n=94$) using 90 PrivacyLens scenarios. We found that users had low agreement with each other when evaluating identical LLM responses. In contrast, five proxy LLMs reached high agreement, yet each proxy LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that proxy LLMs cannot accurately estimate users' wide range of perceptions of utility and privacy in privacy-sensitive scenarios. We discuss the need for more user-centered studies to measure LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy, and for improving alignment between LLMs and users in estimating perceived privacy and utility.</description>

      <title>Beyond Direct Generation: A Decomposed Approach to Well-Crafted Screenwriting with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use. To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets. Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.</description>

      <title>Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Trust and Reputation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern socio-technical systems increasingly involve multi-stakeholder environments where actors simultaneously cooperate and compete. These coopetitive relationships exhibit dynamic trust evolution based on observed behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence. Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in conceptual models that capture strategic dependencies covering mixed motives of actors. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. Building on companion work that achieved 58/60 validation (96.7%) for logarithmic specifications, we introduce trust as a two-layer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We develop a structured translation framework enabling practitioners to instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks encompassing mixed motives of actors. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49/60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.</description>

      <title>Alpamayo-R1: Bridging Reasoning and Action Prediction for Generalizable Autonomous Driving in the Long Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end architectures trained via imitation learning have advanced autonomous driving by scaling model size and data, yet performance remains brittle in safety-critical long-tail scenarios where supervision is sparse and causal understanding is limited. We introduce Alpamayo-R1 (AR1), a vision-language-action model (VLA) that integrates Chain of Causation reasoning with trajectory planning for complex driving scenarios. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) the Chain of Causation (CoC) dataset, built through a hybrid auto-labeling and human-in-the-loop pipeline producing decision-grounded, causally linked reasoning traces aligned with driving behaviors; (2) a modular VLA architecture combining Cosmos-Reason, a vision-language model pre-trained for Physical AI, with a diffusion-based trajectory decoder that generates dynamically feasible trajectories in real time; (3) a multi-stage training strategy using supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) to enforce reasoning-action consistency and optimize reasoning quality. AR1 achieves up to a 12% improvement in planning accuracy on challenging cases compared to a trajectory-only baseline, with a 35% reduction in close encounter rate in closed-loop simulation. RL post-training improves reasoning quality by 45% and reasoning-action consistency by 37%. Model scaling from 0.5B to 7B parameters shows consistent improvements. On-vehicle road tests confirm real-time performance (99 ms latency) and successful urban deployment. By bridging interpretable reasoning with precise control, AR1 demonstrates a practical path towards Level 4 autonomous driving.

      <title>EngTrace: A Symbolic Benchmark for Verifiable Process Supervision of Engineering Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly entering specialized, safety-critical engineering workflows governed by strict quantitative standards and immutable physical laws, making rigorous evaluation of their reasoning capabilities imperative. However, existing benchmarks such as MMLU, MATH, and HumanEval assess isolated cognitive skills, failing to capture the physically grounded reasoning central to engineering, where scientific principles, quantitative modeling, and practical constraints must converge. To enable verifiable process supervision in engineering, we introduce EngTrace, a symbolic benchmark comprising 90 templates across three major engineering branches, nine core domains and 20 distinct areas. Through domain-aware parameterization, we generate 1,350 unique, contamination-resistant test cases to stress-test generalization. Moving beyond outcome matching, we introduce a verifiable two-stage evaluation framework that uses a tiered protocol to validate intermediate reasoning traces alongside final answers through automated procedural checks and a heterogeneous AI Tribunal. Our evaluation of 24 leading LLMs reveals a distinct trade-off between numeric precision and trace fidelity, identifying a complexity cliff where abstract mathematical pre-training fails to translate into the integrative reasoning required for advanced engineering tasks.</description>

      <title>Transolver is a Linear Transformer: Revisiting Physics-Attention through the Lens of Linear Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer-based Neural Operators have enabled significant progress in data-driven solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six standard PDE benchmarks, while reducing the number of parameters by an average of 40.0% and computational cost by 36.2%. Additionally, it delivers superior performance on two challenging, industrial-level datasets: AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.</description>

      <title>Enabling Agents to Communicate Entirely in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by telepathy, which bypasses symbolic language in communication, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the continuous last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its thought for direct communication (termed latent communication). An additional learned compression process further compresses latent communication via latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, even across heterogeneous models, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference by up to 24 times but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Diffusion Transformer with Decoupled Attention for High-Fidelity Mask-Text Collaborative Facial Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While significant progress has been achieved in multimodal facial generation using semantic masks and textual descriptions, conventional feature fusion approaches often fail to enable effective cross-modal interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal generation outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce MDiTFace--a customized diffusion transformer framework that employs a unified tokenization strategy to process semantic mask and text inputs, eliminating discrepancies between heterogeneous modality representations. The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDiTFace significantly outperforms other competing methods in terms of both facial fidelity and conditional consistency.</description>

      <title>CausalProfiler: Generating Synthetic Benchmarks for Rigorous and Transparent Evaluation of Causal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal machine learning (Causal ML) aims to answer "what if" questions using machine learning algorithms, making it a promising tool for high-stakes decision-making. Yet, empirical evaluation practices in Causal ML remain limited. Existing benchmarks often rely on a handful of hand-crafted or semi-synthetic datasets, leading to brittle, non-generalizable conclusions. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalProfiler, a synthetic benchmark generator for Causal ML methods. Based on a set of explicit design choices about the class of causal models, queries, and data considered, the CausalProfiler randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths constituting the synthetic causal benchmarks. In this way, Causal ML methods can be rigorously and transparently evaluated under a variety of conditions. This work offers the first random generator of synthetic causal benchmarks with coverage guarantees and transparent assumptions operating on the three levels of causal reasoning: observation, intervention, and counterfactual. We demonstrate its utility by evaluating several state-of-the-art methods under diverse conditions and assumptions, both in and out of the identification regime, illustrating the types of analyses and insights the CausalProfiler enables.</description>

      <title>Table as a Modality for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To migrate the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), the community has made numerous efforts to generalize them to the table reasoning tasks for the widely deployed tabular data. Despite that, in this work, by showing a probing experiment on our proposed StructQA benchmark, we postulate that even the most advanced LLMs (such as GPTs) may still fall short of coping with tabular data. More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM. Empirical results on various benchmarking datasets, including HiTab, WikiTQ, WikiSQL, FeTaQA, and StructQA, have demonstrated significant improvements on generalization with an average relative gain of 42.65%.</description>

      <title>Venus: An Efficient Edge Memory-and-Retrieval System for VLM-based Online Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension capabilities and are being deployed in an increasing number of online video understanding applications. While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.</description>

      <title>SWAA: Sliding Window Attention Adaptation for Efficient Long-Context LLMs Without Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) renders long-context inference prohibitively expensive. While Sliding Window Attention (SWA), the simplest sparse attention pattern, offers a linear-complexity alternative, naively applying it to models pretrained with Full Attention (FA) causes catastrophic long-context performance collapse due to the training-inference mismatch. To address this, we propose Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a plug-and-play toolkit of recipes that adapt FA models to SWA without costly pretraining. SWAA systematically combines five strategies: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that while individual methods are insufficient, specific synergistic combinations can effectively recover original long-context capabilities. After further analyzing performance-efficiency trade-offs, we identify recommended SWAA configurations for diverse scenarios, which achieve 30% to 100% speedups for long-context LLM inference with acceptable quality loss.

      <title>Rethinking Jailbreak Detection of Large Vision Language Models with Representational Contrastive Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to a growing array of multimodal jailbreak attacks, necessitating defenses that are both generalizable to novel threats and efficient for practical deployment. Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types. This work demonstrates that effective jailbreak detection can be achieved by applying simple, interpretable statistical methods to the appropriate internal representations, offering a practical path towards safer LVLM deployment. Our code is available on Github https://github.com/sarendis56/Jailbreak_Detection_RCS.</description>

      <title>Improving Underwater Acoustic Classification Through Learnable Gabor Filter Convolution and Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remotely detecting and classifying underwater acoustic targets is critical for environmental monitoring and defence. However, the complexity of ship-radiated and environmental noise poses significant challenges for accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated using three training-test split strategies that reflect increasingly complex classification tasks, demonstrating how systematic evaluation design addresses issues such as data leakage, temporal separation, and taxonomy. Results show that GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, adding Gabor convolutions to the initial layers of the model reduced training time by up to 62%. During the evaluation of training-testing splits, temporal separation between subsets significantly affected performance, proving more influential than training data volume. These findings suggest that signal processing can enhance model reliability and generalisation under varying environmental conditions, particularly in data-limited underwater acoustic classification. Future developments should focus on mitigating environmental effects on input signals.</description>

      <title>V-Agent: An Interactive Video Search System Using Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce V-Agent, a novel multi-agent platform designed for advanced video search and interactive user-system conversations. By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications. The retrieval model and demo videos are available at https://huggingface.co/NCSOFT/multimodal-embedding.</description>

      <title>A Formal Descriptive Language for Learning Dynamics: A Five-Layer Structural Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding learning as a dynamic process is challenging due to the interaction of multiple factors, including cognitive load, internal state change, and subjective evaluation. Existing approaches often address these elements in isolation, limiting the ability to describe learning phenomena within a unified and structurally explicit framework. This paper proposes a multi-layer formal descriptive framework for learning dynamics. Rather than offering a predictive or prescriptive model, the framework introduces a symbolic language composed of state variables, mappings, and layer-specific responsibilities, enabling consistent description of learning processes without commitment to specific functional forms or optimization objectives. This descriptive framework is intended to serve as a structural substrate for analyzing learning processes in human learners, and by extension, in adaptive and Al-assisted learning systems. A central design principle is the explicit separation of descriptive responsibilities across layers, distinguishing load generation, internal understanding transformation, observation, and evaluation. Within this structure, cognitive load is treated as a relational quantity arising from interactions between external input and internal organization, while subjective evaluation is modeled as a minimal regulatory interface responding to learning dynamics and environmental conditions. By emphasizing descriptive clarity and extensibility, the framework provides a common language for organizing existing theories and supporting future empirical and theoretical work.</description>

      <title>VULCAN: Tool-Augmented Multi Agents for Iterative 3D Object Arrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines.

      <title>When in Doubt, Consult: Expert Debate for Sexism Detection via Confidence-Based Routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online sexism increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to better regularize supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. First, we stabilize the training combining class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration, strategies for the firs time adapted for this domain to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. Second, we bridge the gap between efficiency and reasoning with a a dynamic routing mechanism that distinguishes between unambiguous instances and complex cases requiring a deliberative process. This reasoning process results in the novel Collaborative Expert Judgment (CEJ) module which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach outperforms existing approaches across several public benchmarks, with F1 gains of +4.48% and +1.30% on EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively, and a +2.79% improvement in ICM on EXIST 2025 Task 1.1.</description>

      <title>The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can be associated with a reduction of total website traffic to large publishers compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Networks (IM-PINN) for Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics on Complex Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonlinear reaction-diffusion dynamics on complex, non-Euclidean manifolds remains a fundamental challenge in computational morphogenesis, constrained by high-fidelity mesh generation costs and symplectic drift in discrete time-stepping schemes. This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a "Stochastic Cloth" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the "splitting spot" and "labyrinthine" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\mathcal{E}_{mass} \approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration. The framework offers a memory-efficient, resolution-independent paradigm for simulating biological pattern formation on evolving surfaces, bridging differential geometry and physics-informed machine learning.</description>

      <title>Attention Needs to Focus: A Unified Perspective on Attention Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture, a cornerstone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved extraordinary success in sequence modeling, primarily due to its attention mechanism. However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity.</description>

      <title>Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper, introducing a novel method in philomatics, draws on Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblance from analytic philosophy to develop a clustering algorithm for machine learning. According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes.</description>

      <title>Does Memory Need Graphs? A Unified Framework and Empirical Analysis for Long-Term Dialog Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph structures are increasingly used in dialog memory systems, but empirical findings on their effectiveness remain inconsistent, making it unclear which design choices truly matter. We present an experimental, system-oriented analysis of long-term dialog memory architectures. We introduce a unified framework that decomposes dialog memory systems into core components and supports both graph-based and non-graph approaches. Under this framework, we conduct controlled, stage-wise experiments on LongMemEval and HaluMem, comparing common design choices in memory representation, organization, maintenance, and retrieval. Our results show that many performance differences are driven by foundational system settings rather than specific architectural innovations. Based on these findings, we identify stable and reliable strong baselines for future dialog memory research.</description>

      <title>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</description>

      <title>FastV-RAG: Towards Fast and Fine-Grained Video QA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual reasoning but still struggle with integrating external knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness. Second, we identify a major source of error - incorrect entity recognition in retrieved knowledge - and mitigate it with a simple yet effective similarity-based filtering strategy that improves entity alignment and boosts overall answer accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that VideoSpeculateRAG achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x. Our framework highlights the potential of combining speculative decoding with retrieval-augmented reasoning to enhance efficiency and reliability in complex, knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.</description>
