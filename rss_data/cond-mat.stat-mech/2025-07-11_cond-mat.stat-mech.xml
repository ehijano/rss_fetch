      <title>Finite-temperature criticality through quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical phenomena at finite temperature underpin a broad range of physical systems, yet their study remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks near phase transitions. Quantum annealers have attracted significant interest as a potential tool for accessing finite temperature criticality beyond classical reach, but their utility in precisely resolving criticality has remained limited by noise, hardware constraints, and thermal fluctuations. Here we overcome these challenges, showing that careful calibration and embedding allow quantum annealers to capture the full finite-temperature critical behavior of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. By tuning the energy scale of the system and mitigating device asymmetries, we sample effective Boltzmann distributions and extract both the critical temperature and the associated critical exponents. Our approach opens the study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium critical phenomena in a broad class of systems at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Confined and deconfined chaos in classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Confined chaos thus far precedes thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter causes chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.</description>

      <title>Local imperfect feedback control in non-equilibrium biophysical systems enabled by thermodynamic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback, without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Way More Than the Sum of Their Parts: From Statistical to Structural Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad consequences for system ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum behavior on frustrated Ising model: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the quantum effects of a frustrated Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Master equations for continuous-time random walks with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general continuous-time random walk (CTRW), by including non-Markovian cases and L\'evy flights, under complete stochastic resetting to the initial position with an arbitrary law, which can be power-lawed as well as Poissonian. We provide three linked results. First, we show that the random walk under stochastic resetting is a CTRW with the same jump-size distribution of the non-reset original CTRW but different counting process. Later, we derive the condition for a CTRW with stochastic resetting to be a meaningful displacement process at large elapsed times, i.e., the probability to jump to any site is higher than the probability to be reset to the initial position, and we call this condition the zero-law for stochastic resetting. This law joins with the other two laws for reset random walks concerning the existence and the non-existence of a non-equilibrium stationary state. Finally, we derive master equations for CTRWs when the resetting law is a completely monotone function.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium distribution function for strongly nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium distribution function determines macroscopic observables in statistical physics. While conventional methods correct equilibrium distributions in weakly nonlinear or near-integrable systems, they fail in strongly nonlinear regimes. We develop a framework to get the equilibrium distributions and dispersion relations in strongly nonlinear many-body systems, incorporating corrections beyond the random phase approximation and capturing intrinsic nonlinear effects. The theory is verified on the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model, and the FPUT-beta model, demonstrating its accuracy across distinct types of nonlinear systems. Numerical results show substantial improvements over existing approaches, even in strong nonlinear regimes. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for equilibrium statistical properties in strongly nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Exotic collective dynamics in molten Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective longitudinal and transverse propagating modes in molten Carbon at $T=5500$~K and pressure range $10$-$40$ GPa are reported from {\it ab initio} based as well as machine learned molecular dynamics. A striking exotic feature in collective dynamics is the two-peak shape of the current spectral functions of the single-component liquid, which makes evidence of a second branch of longitudinal propagating modes in the wave number range $k&gt;1$\AA$^{-1}$. It is shown that time correlation functions reflecting the out-of-phase motion of particles and their cages of nearest neighbors results in the same frequencies of the exotic low-frequency branch of vibrations. A theoretical framework of generalized collective modes is applied to recover the time dependence of density-density, imaginary part of susceptibility and longitudinal current-current correlations.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity at the Absorbing State Transition: Perturbative RG for Random Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, where the static structure factor obeys $S(q)\sim q^{\varsigma}$ with $\varsigma&gt; 0$, emerges at criticality in systems having multiple, symmetry-unrelated, absorbing states. Important examples arise in periodically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids; these lie in the random organisation (RO) universality class, for which analytic results for $\varsigma$ are lacking. Here, using Doi-Peliti field theory and perturbative RG about a Gaussian model, we find $\varsigma = 0^+$ and $\varsigma= 2\epsilon/9 + O(\epsilon^2)$ in dimension $d&gt;d_c=4$ and $d=4-\epsilon$ respectively. Our calculations assume that renormalizability is sustained via a certain pattern of cancellation of strongly divergent terms. These cancellations allow the upper critical dimension to remain $d_c = 4$, as is known for RO, while generic perturbations (e.g., those violating particle conservation) would typically flow to a fixed point with $d_c=6$. The assumed cancellation pattern is closely reminiscent of a long-established one near the tricritical Ising fixed point. (This has $d_c=3$, although generic perturbations flow towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with $d_c = 4$.) We show how hyperuniformity in RO emerges from anticorrelation of strongly fluctuating active and passive densities. Our calculations also yield the remaining exponents to order $\epsilon$, surprisingly without recourse to functional RG. These exponents coincide as expected with the Conserved Directed Percolation (C-DP) class which also contains the Manna Model and the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (q-EW) model. Importantly however, our $\varsigma$ differs from one found via a mapping to q-EW. That mapping neglects a conserved noise in the RO action, which we argue to be dangerously irrelevant. Thus, although other exponents are common to both, the RO and C-DP universality classes have different exponents for hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Instability in Ostwald ripening processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a dimensionless parameter which enters into the equation for the evolution of supersaturation in Ostwald ripening processes. This parameter is typically a large number. Here it is argued that the consequent stiffness of the equation results in the evolution of the supersaturation being unstable. The instability is evident in numerical simulations of Ostwald ripening.</description>

      <title>Excess Observables Reveal Nonreciprocity in Integrated Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near equilibrium, the symmetric part of the time-integrated steady-state covariance, i.e., the time integral of correlation functions, is governed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, while the antisymmetric part vanishes due to Onsager reciprocity. Far from equilibrium, where these principles no longer apply, we develop a unified formalism for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of integrated covariances. We derive exact, computationally tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds for these covariances in terms of entropy production, dynamical activity, and cycle affinities.</description>

      <title>Finite-time and Finite-size scalings of coercivity in dynamic hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coercivity panorama for characterizing the dynamic hysteresis in interacting systems across multiple timescales is proposed by Chen et al. in a companion paper. For the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving of rate $v_H$, the coercivity landscape $H_c(v_H)$ exhibits plateau features at a characteristic rate $v_P$ with the corresponding coercivity $H_P$. Below this plateau ($v_H&lt;v_P$), the $H_c\sim v_H$ scaling obtained in the near-equilibrium regime becomes inaccessible in the thermodynamic limit. Above the plateau ($v_H&gt;v_P$), scaling in the fast-driving regime, $H_c\sim v_H^{1/2}$, is completely different from that, $H_c-H_P\sim (v_H-v_P)^{2/3}$, in the post-plateau slow-driving regime. The emergence of the plateau with a finite-size scaling reflects the competition between the thermodynamic limit and the quasi-static limit. In this paper, we provide detailed analytical proofs and numerical evidence supporting these results. Moreover, to demonstrate the coercivity panorama in concrete physical systems, we study the magnetic hysteresis in the Curie-Weiss model and analyze its finite-size effects. We reveal that finite-time coercivity scaling shows model-specific behavior only in the fast-driving regime, while exhibiting universal characteristics elsewhere.</description>

      <title>A c-theorem for the effective central charge in the R=1 replica limit, and applications to systems with measurement-induced randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a $R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a replica interaction of the form $$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x \sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here $\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem. Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, as opposed to measurements.</description>

      <title>Large-scale portfolio optimization with variational neural annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis applied to the S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm on portfolio optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transitions in monitored gaussian fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum systems, where unitary dynamics compete with continuous measurements, exhibit dynamical transitions as the measurement rate is varied. These reflect abrupt changes in the structure of the evolving wavefunction, captured by complementary complexity diagnostics that include and go beyond entanglement aspects. Here, we investigate how monitoring affects magic state resources, the nonstabilizerness, of Gaussian fermionic systems. Using scalable Majorana sampling techniques, we track the evolution of stabilizer R\'enyi entropies in large systems under projective measurements. While the leading extensive (volume-law) scaling of magic remains robust across all measurement rates, we uncover a sharp transition in the subleading logarithmic corrections. This measurement-induced complexity transition, invisible to standard entanglement probes, highlights the power of magic-based diagnostics in revealing hidden features of monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for energy eigenstates of SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics, to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Superheating and melting phenomena of a vibrated granular layer of cubic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the combined results of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations conducted to investigate superheating phenomena in vertically vibrated granular matter. Specifically, we consider a system of cubic particles densely packed in a square-lattice array and subjected to different shaking strengths, denoted by Gamma, approaching a critical value Gamma_c. Below Gamma_c, the superheated crystalline array remains indefinitely stable. Above Gamma_c, it transitions progressively into a granular liquid-like state over a Gamma-dependent timescale tau. We show that while an increase in frictional contacts significantly prolongs the lifetime of the superheated crystalline state, it does not play a major role in the scaling laws governing how that lifetime depends on shaking strength. Our findings also show that the transition from the superheated solid to the liquid state in the vibrated system is well described by a Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) equation, which is commonly used to model phase transformations in thermal systems.</description>

      <title>Localization and top eigenvalue detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of the top eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector in ensembles of random matrices has significant applications across various fields. An existing method, based on the linear stability of a complementary set of cavity equations, has been successful in identifying the top eigenvalue when the associated eigenvector is extended. However, this approach fails when the eigenvector is localized. In this work, we adapt the real-valued cavity method to address this limitation by introducing a novel criterion that exploits the constraints of the cavity equations to detect the top eigenvalue in systems with a localized top eigenvector. Our results are validated using the Anderson model as a paradigmatic example.</description>

      <title>Deterministic simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate simplicial complexes deterministically growing from a single vertex. In the first step, a vertex and an edge connecting it to the primordial vertex are added. The resulting simplicial complex has a 1-dimensional simplex and two 0-dimensional faces (the vertices). The process continues recursively: On the $n$-th step, every existing $d-$dimensional simplex ($d\leq n-1$) joins a new vertex forming a $(d+1)-$dimensional simplex; all $2^{d+1}-2$ new faces are also added so that the resulting object remains a simplicial complex. The emerging simplicial complex has intriguing local and global characteristics. The number of simplices grows faster than $n!$, and the upper-degree distributions follow a power law. Here, the upper degree (or $d$-degree) of a $d$-simplex refers to the number of $(d{+}1)$-simplices that share it as a face. Interestingly, the $d$-degree distributions evolve quite differently for different values of $d$. We compute the Hodge Laplacian spectra of simplicial complexes and show that the spectral and Hausdorff dimensions are infinite. We also explore a constrained version where the dimension of the added simplices is fixed to a finite value $m$. In the constrained model, the number of simplices grows exponentially. In particular, for $m=1$, the spectral dimension is $2$. For $m=2$, the spectral dimension is finite, and the degree distribution follows a power law, while the $1$-degree distribution decays exponentially.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the conventional spin-wave dynamics and its double-constraint modification in the spin-$\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}}$ triangular-prism Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous magnon decays in an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the equilateral triangular prism are investigated in terms of modified magnon Green's functions. In one dimension, the so-called infrared divergence prevents us from calculating any -- whether static or dynamic -- structure factor within the conventional spin-wave theory even at zero temperature. The well-known modified spin-wave theory initiated by Takahashi completely fails to treat anharmonicities to cause transverse-to-longitudinal coupling which are quite characteristic of noncollinear antiferromagnets. We propose imposing a double-constraint condition on spin waves to solve all these difficulties and get a full view of the nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in one-dimensional frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnets. We reveal a novel instability of the single-particle spectrum in the absence of any well-defined magnetically ordered ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework based on the functional derivative to extract nonlinear dynamical response functions from the temporal evolution of physical quantities, without explicitly computing multipoint correlation functions. We validate our approach by calculating the second- and third-order optical responses in the Rice-Mele model and further apply it to a many-body interacting system using a tensor network method. This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

      <title>Shaping Magnetic Order by Local Frustration for Itinerant Fermions on a Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic magnetism is an iconic and rare example of collective quantum order that emerges from the interference of paths taken by a hole in a sea of strongly interacting fermions. Here the lattice topology plays a fundamental role, with odd loops frustrating ferromagnetism, as seen in recent experiments. However, the resulting magnetic order on a general graph has remained elusive. Here we systematically establish, using exact diagonalization, that local frustration centers on a grid strongly bind singlets while sharing a delocalized hole. This collective effect generalizes to random graphs, producing sharp and predictable variation with tunable frustration measures. Our findings demonstrate that one can shape the spin order as well as tune the net magnetization by embedding geometric frustration, opening up new avenues for spatially resolved quantum control of many-body systems. We outline a protocol to realize some of the key findings in existing cold-atom setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) introduce well-known lattice artifacts. We present a novel Pseudoperiodic Spherical Boundary Condition (SBC) that is perfectly isotropic. Through detailed comparative simulations, we demonstrate that SBC eliminates the structural and dynamic anisotropy inherent to PBC. For the crowded systems where these artifacts are most prominent, our method is also computationally more efficient than standard Minimum Image Convention implementations. This establishes SBC as a powerful, high-fidelity alternative for simulating isotropic matter.</description>

      <title>A statistical physics framework for optimal learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting. Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded in statistical physics.</description>

Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian framework to infer radial distribution functions from experimental scattering measurements with uncertainty quantification using non-stationary Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process prior mean and kernel functions are designed to mitigate well-known numerical challenges with the Fourier transform, including discrete measurement binning and detector windowing, while encoding fundamental yet minimal physical knowledge of liquid structure. We demonstrate uncertainty propagation of the Gaussian process posterior to unmeasured quantities of interest. The methodology is applied to liquid argon and water as a proof of principle. The full implementation is available on GitHub at https://github.com/hoepfnergroup/LiquidStructureGP-Sullivan.</description>

      <title>Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that "imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.</description>

Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Economic inequality is driven by the structure of agent networks, interactions among agents, and the abilities of individual agents. We provide a comprehensive picture of anomalous diffusion, economic class division, and bimodal wealth distribution in an agent-based model, where heterogeneous agent abilities and growth rates are tuned on sparse regular networks. In particular, we focus on the statistical characteristics of logarithmic scaled normalized wealth distributions with two ability parameters, assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and concentration $\mathcal{R}$. For the set of $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R})$, temporal behaviors of log-wealth distributions reveal that the decoupling between different ability groups depends primarily on $\mathcal{R}$ and long-term inequality depends mainly on $\mathcal{A}$. In other words, class division and decoupling are driven by $\mathcal{R}$, while the super-diffusive nature in the leading class is driven by $\mathcal{A}$. Our findings highlight that hierarchical segregation of abilities, rather than ability differences alone, is a key driver of economic class stratification. Finally, our model provides a minimal, yet powerful framework for understanding the bimodal global income distribution observed over the past half century and highlights the critical role of network-level segregation in shaping economic inequality.</description>

      <title>Electron Ptychography Reveals Correlated Lattice Vibrations at Atomic Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12017</link>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an electron ptychography reconstruction framework, CAVIAR -- Correlated Atomic Vibration Imaging with sub-Angstrom Resolution -- that reveals an entirely new channel of information: spatial correlations in atomic displacements at the atomic scale. We show reconstructions of a symmetric $\Sigma$9 grain boundary in silicon from realistically simulated data and experimental data for hexagonal boron nitride. By reconstructing the object as an ensemble of multiple states we are able to observe correlations between movements of atoms in the range of 10-20 pm at room temperature in agreement with the expectation. Moreover, using only the masses of the atomic species and the temperature as input, we obtain average frequencies of $10.8\pm0.1$, $13.6\pm0.6$, $18.0\pm0.2$, $25.5\pm1.5$ THz for the longitudinal and transversal acoustic and optic phonons, respectively, in agreement with inelastic neutron scattering, albeit from just a few nm$^3$ volume. This ability to spatially resolve correlated atomic motion makes CAVIAR a unique tool to explore atom dynamics at the finest scale with the potential to be instrumental in the development of phononic devices, in studying phonon-based decoherence in quantum systems, or other emerging phonon-based applications.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

      <title>Thermalization and hydrodynamic long-time tails in a Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and exceptional points in nonreciprocal active polar mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many active matter systems consist of different particle types that interact via nonreciprocal couplings. Such nonreciprocal couplings can lead to the spontaneous emergence of time-dependent states that break parity-time symmetry. On the field-theoretical level, the transition to these states is marked by so-called exceptional points. However, their precise impact on observable particle dynamics remains poorly understood. In this study, we address this gap by providing a scale-bridging view of a minimal active mixture with nonreciprocal polar interactions. We find that nonreciprocity induces chiral motion on the particle level, yet no full, homogeneous synchronization. Instead, we observe various behaviors, ranging from fully synchronized clusters to chimera-like states. The nonreciprocity-induced spontaneous chirality increases with the degree of nonreciprocity and peaks at coupling strengths associated with exceptional points.</description>

      <title>String Formation and Arrested Ordering Kinetics in Nematics Induced by Polar Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study explores the mixture of polar particles in apolar environment. We employ a coarse-grained approach to model the mixture, where polar particles are in minority. The interaction between polar and apolar components is incorporated via a coupling term in the free energy. Coupling generates local interaction in the system which results in the formation of string like structures connecting a pair of half integer topological defects. The increase in the coupling strength or the density of polar particles results in the: Sharper strings with larger probability of connecting the topological defects of same charge and the enhanced dynamics of topological defects. However, the ordering kinetics of the system shows the delayed coarsening for larger coupling or polar density. Our results can be used to develop controlled kinetics as well as to detect the impurities in liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Non-positive energy quasidistributions in coherent collision models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</description>

      <title>Noise equals control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions occur. By mapping this Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical results for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial expansions, and the high-pressure regime. In particular, we identify a crossover in the anisotropic pressure components: at high densities, the transverse pressure overtakes the longitudinal one when the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. We also examine spatial correlations in particle arrangements and radial fluctuations, shedding light on the emergence of ordering in confined systems.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy permutation time irreversibility for nonequilibrium analysis of complex system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation time irreversibility is an important method to quantify nonequilibrium characteristics of complex systems; however, ordinal pattern is a coarse-graining alternative of temporal structure and cannot accurately represent detailed structural information. This study aims to propose a fuzzy permutation time irreversibility (fpTIR) by measuring the difference between vector elements based on a negative exponential function. The amplitude permutation of vector is constructed and its membership degree is calculated; then, the difference in probability distribution between the forward and backward sequences is measured for fpTIR. To compare and measure the system's complexity, the Shannon entropy is calculated as the average amount of information in the fuzzy permutation probability distribution, i.e., fuzzy permutation entropy (fPEn). According to the surrogate theory, mode series are generated using logistic, Henon, and first-order autoregressive systems to verify the fpTIR, which is then used to analyze the heartbeats of patients with congestive heart failure and healthy elderly and young participants from the PhysioNet database. Results suggest that the fpTIR effectively measures the system's nonequilibrium characteristics, thus improving the accuracy of heartbeat analysis. However, in analyzing probability distributions, the fpTIR and fPEn exhibit discrepancies in the chaotic series and even opposite results in the heartbeats, wherein the results of fpTIR are consistent with the theory of complexity loss in aging and disease. Overall, the fpTIR accurately characterizes the structure of the sequences and enhances the accuracy of the nonequilibrium analysis of complex systems, providing a theoretical basis for exploring complex systems from the perspectives of nonequilibrium dynamics and entropy complexity.</description>
