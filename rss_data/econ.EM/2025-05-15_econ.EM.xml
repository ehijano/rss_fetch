      <title>Better Understanding Triple Differences Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple Differences (DDD) designs are widely used in empirical work to relax parallel trends assumptions in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) settings. This paper shows that common DDD implementations -- such as taking the difference between two DiDs or applying three-way fixed effects regressions -- are generally invalid when identification requires conditioning on covariates. In staggered adoption settings, the common DiD practice of pooling all not-yet-treated units as a comparison group introduces additional bias, even when covariates are not required for identification. These insights challenge conventional empirical strategies and underscore the need for estimators tailored specifically to DDD structures. We develop regression adjustment, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators that remain valid under covariate-adjusted DDD parallel trends. For staggered designs, we show how to correctly leverage multiple comparison groups to get more informative inference. Simulations highlight substantial bias reductions and precision gains relative to standard approaches, offering a new framework for credible DDD estimation in empirical research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Post-Hoc Theorizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many economic questions, the empirical results are not interesting unless they are strong. For these questions, theorizing before the results are known is not always optimal. Instead, the optimal sequencing of theory and empirics trades off a ``Darwinian Learning'' effect from theorizing first with a ``Statistical Learning'' effect from examining the data first. This short paper formalizes the tradeoff in a Bayesian model. In the modern era of mature economic theory and enormous datasets, I argue that post hoc theorizing is typically optimal.</description>

      <title>Matrix-based Prediction Approach for Intraday Instantaneous Volatility Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for predicting intraday instantaneous volatility based on Ito semimartingale models using high-frequency financial data. Several studies have highlighted stylized volatility time series features, such as interday auto-regressive dynamics and the intraday U-shaped pattern. To accommodate these volatility features, we propose an interday-by-intraday instantaneous volatility matrix process that can be decomposed into low-rank conditional expected instantaneous volatility and noise matrices. To predict the low-rank conditional expected instantaneous volatility matrix, we propose the Two-sIde Projected-PCA (TIP-PCA) procedure. We establish asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and conduct a simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed prediction method. Finally, we apply the TIP-PCA method to an out-of-sample instantaneous volatility vector prediction study using high-frequency data from the S&amp;P 500 index and 11 sector index funds.</description>
