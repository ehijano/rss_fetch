      <title>Dirac Oscillator in DSR: A Comparative Study of Magueijo-Smolin and Amelino-Camelia Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy spectrum of the Dirac oscillator within the framework of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), focusing on two prominent models: the Magueijo--Smolin (MS) and Amelino-Camelia models. We derive the modified Dirac equations in both MS and Amelino-Camelia DSR models under the approximation of $$O(E^{2}/k^{2})$$ for a single particle and examine the resulting energy spectra. The study reveals significant corrections to the standard relativistic Dirac oscillator spectrum due to the Planck-scale deformation parameter $$k$$, which introduces distinct deviations depending on the DSR model employed. For the MS model, we observe non-uniform shifts in both positive and negative energy branches at small $$k$$, with the spectrum gradually flattening toward the canonical result as $$k$$ increases. In the Amelino-Camelia model, the energy levels show larger deviations at lower values of $$k$$, and these anomalies diminish more slowly compared to the MS model. The results provide insights into the impact of quantum gravity effects on quantum systems, with potential applications in high-precision spectroscopic or astrophysical observations at energies near the Planck scale. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of these two DSR models highlights the robustness of Planck-scale predictions and guides future experimental efforts aimed at detecting quantum-gravity signatures.</description>

      <title>A unified relativistic path integral origin for noise-activated collapse and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativity and quantum mechanics are two cornerstones of modern physics, yet their unification within a single-particle path integral and a dynamic explanation of quantum measurement remain unresolved. Historically, these two problems have been treated as separate, but we in this work show they are intimately linked. We construct a relativistic path integral that recovers the Dirac, Klein-Gordon, and Schr\"odinger equations, while also exposing a latent nonlocal term in the propagator. This term dormant in differentiable potentials but is activated by non-differentiable noise, driving outcome probabilities through bounded-martingale stochastic process. In this regime, the pointer basis emerges as absorbing boundaries, Born's rule arises from first-passage statistics, and collapse occurs in finite, parameter-dependent time, thereby reducing measurement axioms to dynamical consequences. Crucially, our work recovers the standard GKSL master equation by taking the ensemble average over the noise, and thus provides a first-principles foundation for decoherence. Because the trigger is the noise spectrum, our work shows that engineering ``colored'' noise can expedite or steer collapse, suggesting practical routes to fast qubit reset, coherence preservation, and quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit.</description>
