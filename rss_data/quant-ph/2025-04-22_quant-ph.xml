      <description>arXiv:2504.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are rapidly advancing as image classification tasks grow more complex due to large image volumes and extensive parameter updates required by traditional machine learning models. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers a promising solution for medical image classification. The parallelization of quantum computing can significantly improve speed and accuracy in disease detection and diagnosis. This paper provides an overview of recent studies on medical image classification through a structured taxonomy, highlighting key contributions, limitations and gaps in current research.

      <title>Simulating Nonlinearity in Quantum Neural Networks While Mitigating Barren Plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) encounter significant challenges in realizing nonlinear behavior and effectively optimizing parameters. This study addresses these issues by modeling nonlinearity through a Taylor series expansion, where the method uses tensor products to generate the series basis, and parameterized unitary matrices define the corresponding coefficients. This design substantially reduces quantum circuit depth compared to conventional methods that rely on parameterized quantum gates, thereby mitigating the barren plateau problem. A QNN was implemented and tested on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets to evaluate the proposed method, achieving test accuracies of 98.7% and 88.3%, respectively. With noise added, the accuracy decreased slightly to 98.6% and 87.2%.</description>

      <title>Predicting fermionic densities using a Projected Quantum Kernel method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.</description>

      <title>Short remarks on shallow unitary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (i) We point out that every shallow unitary circuit of depth smaller than the linear system size is easily distinguished from a Haar random unitary if there is a conserved quantity that is a sum of local operators. This is always the case with a continuous onsite symmetry or with a local energy conservation law. (ii) We explain a simple algorithm for a formulation of the shallow unitary circuit learning problem and relate it to an open question on strictly locality-preserving unitaries (quantum cellular automata). (iii) We show that any quantum cellular automaton in $D$-dimensional lattice of volume~$V$ can be implemented using only $O(V)$ local gates in a staircase fashion.</description>

      <title>Comparative Benchmarking of Utility-Scale Quantum Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating quantum algorithms at utility-scale - involving more than 100 qubits - is a key step toward advancing real-world applications of quantum computing. In this study, we benchmark seven state-of-the-art quantum emulators employing techniques such as tensor networks, matrix product states (MPS), decision diagrams, and factorized ket based methods, running on CPU based hardware and focusing on effectively exact simulations. Performance is assessed on 13 benchmark circuits from the MQTBench library, spanning circuit sizes from 4 to 1,024 qubits. Our results reveal that MPS-based emulators outperform other approaches overall, successfully solving 8 benchmarks up to the maximum size of 1,024 qubits and 12 benchmarks up to at least 100 qubits in less than 5 minutes. We find evidence that all circuits except a random one can be simulated in polynomial time. This work demonstrates that quantum emulators can faithfully simulate a broad range of large and complex universal quantum circuits with high fidelity, far beyond the limits of statevector simulators and today's quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Probing Complex Decoherence Processes in Materials for Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary consideration in developing new material platforms for quantum applications is to optimize coherence. Despite its importance, decoherence processes remains challenging to experimentally interrogate and quantify. In this Perspective, we first introduce the concept of decoherence in quantum systems and conventional techniques to assess decoherence at optical frequencies. We then introduce multidimensional coherent spectroscopy as a unique probe capable of revealing the full complexity of decoherence dynamics in realistic circumstances. To contextualize the techniques discussed here, demonstrative examples in two prototypical quantum systems, namely colloidal nanocrystals and vacancy centers in diamond, are provided.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.</description>

      <title>Ptychographic estimation of qudit states encoded in the angular position and orbital angular momentum of single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography is a computational imaging technique mainly used in optical and electron microscopy. Its quantum analogue was recently introduced as a simple method for estimating unknown pure quantum states through projections onto partially overlapping subspaces, each one followed by a projective measurement in the Fourier basis. In the end, an iterative algorithm estimates the state from the collected data. Here, we theoretically describe how to implement this method for $D$-dimensional qudit states encoded in the angular position and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of single photons. For this purpose, we define the qudit by discretizing the spatial profile of a photon in cylindrical coordinates, using an array of $D$ angular slits symmetrically distributed in the transverse plane. To apply ptychography to this encoding, we show that the intermediate projections will be carried out by simple binary spatial filters in the angular paths, while the measurement in the Fourier basis will be performed by postselecting $D$ OAM modes compatible with the quantum Fourier transform of the path basis. We illustrate the effectiveness of this scheme through simulations and discuss its experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Dynamics in Entangled Biphoton Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum light spectroscopy highlight the potential of using entangled photons as a sensitive probe for many-body dynamics and material correlations. However, a comprehensive theory to explain experimental results remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the Hilbert space and the intricate interactions and nonlinearities inherent in material systems. In this work, we introduce a tractable model based on a finite-sized correlation matrix governed by a bilinear bosonic Hamiltonian, enabling efficient simulations through Gaussian-preserving dynamics. We apply this framework to compute the output joint spectral intensity (JSI) and von Neumann entropy of frequency-entangled biphotons, and find close agreement with experimental observations in empty microcavities. Our results reveal the emergence of off-diagonal spectral correlations that can be interpreted as irreversible decay of cavity excitations into the biphoton continua. This approach offers a powerful theoretical tool for interpreting quantum spectroscopic data and paves the way for probing more complex light-matter interactions in materials.</description>

      <title>A streamlined demonstration that stabilizer circuits simulation reduces to Boolean linear algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gottesman-Knill theorem states that computations on stabilizer circuits can be simulated on a classical computer, conventional simulation algorithms extensively use linear algebra over bit strings. For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations. This approach gives a new perspective on explaining the work of stabilizer tableau methods (reproducing the asymptotics) and creates opportunity for exploring various tensor-contraction techniques in stabilizer simulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a family of lower bounds for concurrence in quantum systems using mutually unbiased measurements, which prove more effective in entanglement estimation compared to existing methods. Through analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate that these bounds outperform conventional approaches, particularly in capturing finer entanglement features. Additionally, we introduce separability criterions based on MUMs for arbitrary $d$-dimensional bipartite systems, the research results show that our criterion has more advantages than the existing criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a pivotal role in quantum information processing. Quantifying quantum entanglement is a challenging and essential research area within the field. This manuscript explores the relationships between bipartite entanglement concurrence, multipartite entanglement concurrence, and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) concurrence. We derive lower bounds on GME concurrence from these relationships, demonstrating their superiority over existing results through rigorous proofs and numerical examples. Additionally, we investigate the connections between GME concurrence and other entanglement measures, such as tangle and global negativity, in multipartite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we model the temperature measurement as a transformation of the arbitrary state into the Gibbs state. We start with a general formalism of ansatz-posteriors, which includes many usual models of posterior states due to measurement or state preparation. On the one hand, it contains models of selective and non-selective measurements posteriors as special cases, which allows us to consider it as a generalization of usual measurement models. On the other hand, it contains the abovementioned transformation into the Gibbs state as a special case as well. We derive an analog of the master equation in the stroboscopic limit of repeated measurements. Then we apply our general approach to temperature measurement.</description>

      <title>Application of an upsampling algorithm to quantum state preparation of continuous and discrete probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upsampling of time series data is often associated with classical fast Fourier transform analysis, but it also can be employed in the preparation of a quantum state vector. The quantum circuit of preparation derived from functional data sampled in this way exhibits exponential gate depth, like other divide-and-conquer algorithms, but is transformable to an equivalent circuit of polylogarithmic gate depth. In this study, we derive a polylogarthmic upsampling algorithm for construction of a state vector with amplitudes that are square roots of probabilities sampled from a continuous probability distribution having support over the entire real line. As examples, we prepare state vectors associated with Gaussian and Laplace distributions; state vectors for other continuous probability distributions such as Cauchy and Student's t follow in a similar manner. We also extend the algorithm to include preparation of a state vector whose amplitudes are square roots of an arbitrary distribution of discrete probabilities. Our analyses focus on univariate distributions, but can be extended to multivariate forms. The polylogarithmic upsampling algorithm has financial and scientific application.</description>

      <title>Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata for word statistics facilitated by quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an iterative algorithm to investigate the cooperative evolution dominated by information encoded within state spaces in a random quantum cellular automaton. Inspired by the 2-gram model in statistical linguistics, the updates of quantum states are determined by a given corpus, which serves as the interactions to induce quantum correlations. These local cooperative interactions lead to block-diagonal evolution quantified by the entanglement asymmetry. We evaluate the influence of two-site gates on the iteration process and reveal the associated search speedup. Crucially, we demonstrate the information scrambling dependent of gate sampling, uncovering an intriguing bond percolation. Our results provide an adaptive paradigm for quantum search algorithms and random many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Guess, SWAP, Repeat : Capturing Quantum Snapshots in Classical Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique that enables observation of quantum states without direct measurement, preserving them for reuse. Our method allows multiple quantum states to be observed at different points within a single circuit, one at a time, and saved into classical memory without destruction. These saved states can be accessed on demand by downstream applications, introducing a dynamic and programmable notion of quantum memory that supports modular, non-destructive quantum workflows. We propose a hardware-agnostic, machine learning-driven framework to capture non-destructive estimates, or "snapshots," of quantum states at arbitrary points within a circuit, enabling classical storage and later reconstruction, similar to memory operations in classical computing. This capability is essential for debugging, introspection, and persistent memory in quantum systems, yet remains difficult due to the no-cloning theorem and destructive measurements. Our guess-and-check approach uses fidelity estimation via the SWAP test to guide state reconstruction. We explore both gradient-based deep neural networks and gradient-free evolutionary strategies to estimate quantum states using only fidelity as the learning signal. We demonstrate a key component of our framework on IBM quantum hardware, achieving high-fidelity (approximately 1.0) reconstructions for Hadamard and other known states. In simulation, our models achieve an average fidelity of 0.999 across 100 random quantum states. This provides a pathway toward non-volatile quantum memory, enabling long-term storage and reuse of quantum information, and laying groundwork for future quantum memory architectures.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a established relation in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral, we propose to extract the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through quantum simulation of the integrated correlation functions of trapped two-particle systems on quantum computers. The integrated correlation function can be computed by an ancilla-based algorithm proposed in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevA.64.022319}. The proposal is demonstrated with a simple contact interaction fermion model.</description>

      <title>Entangled states are not always useful for single shot distinguishability of unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been many instances where the entangled state as a probe acts better than the single state in the task of distinguishing quantum channels. We provide a proof in the agreement of this motion in the context of single shot distinguishability of two unitaries. But interestingly, there exists two unitaries which are distinguishable with non-maximally entangled state but indistinguishable with maximally entangled state. One striking feature of optimal probing state in this task can be observed if we increase the number of unitaries more than two. There exists a class of unitaries in every dimension $\geqslant$ 3 for which an input entangled state cannot distinguish them but an input single state can.</description>

      <title>Bolometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors are renowned for their extraordinary photon sensitivity and energy resolution, finding applications spanning quantum information, astronomy, and nanophotonics. Here, we report the development of BOlometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON), a novel platform that integrates bolometric detection at the superconducting transition edges with near-field optical techniques. BOSON enables the mapping of photoinduced changes in superconductivity with unprecedented spatial resolution and photon sensitivity. By incorporating BOSON with low-dimensional materials, we achieved polariton imaging at nanowatt excitation levels--at least four orders of magnitude lower than the power typically required in prior near-field nanoscopy experiments. Our findings highlight the potential for BOSON to advance scanning probe based optical platforms to enable the detection of photons, polaritons, and Cooper pair dynamics at the nanoscale. This paves the way for quantum sensing applications using single-polariton detection and can offer deeper insights into quasiparticle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-based Quantum Code Generation with Multi-Agent Optimization and Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks with Large Language Models (LLMs) have become promising tools for generating general-purpose programming languages using test-driven development, allowing developers to create more accurate and robust code. However, their potential has not been fully unleashed for domain-specific programming languages, where specific domain exhibits unique optimization opportunities for customized improvement. In this paper, we take the first step in exploring multi-agent code generation for quantum programs. By identifying the unique optimizations in quantum designs such as quantum error correction, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework tailored to generating accurate, fault-tolerant quantum code. Each agent in the framework focuses on distinct optimizations, iteratively refining the code using a semantic analyzer with multi-pass inference, alongside an error correction code decoder. We also examine the effectiveness of inference-time techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of quantum programming, uncovering observations that are different from general-purpose code generation. To evaluate our approach, we develop a test suite to measure the impact each optimization has on the accuracy of the generated code. Our findings indicate that techniques such as structured CoT significantly improve the generation of quantum algorithms by up to 50%. In contrast, we have also found that certain techniques such as RAG show limited improvement, yielding an accuracy increase of only 4%. Moreover, we showcase examples of AI-assisted quantum error prediction and correction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-agent framework in reducing the quantum errors of generated quantum programs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Weight Optimization for Neural Networks Using Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main approach to hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (QNN) is employing quantum computing to build a neural network (NN) that has quantum features, which is then optimized classically. Here, we propose a different strategy: to use quantum computing in order to optimize the weights of a classical NN. As such, we design an instance of Grover's quantum search algorithm to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters of an NN during the training process, a task traditionally performed using the backpropagation algorithm with the gradient descent method. Indeed, gradient descent has issues such as exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, or convexity problem. Other methods tried to address such issues with strategies like genetic searches, but they carry additional problems like convergence consistency. Our original method avoids these issues -- because it does not calculate gradients -- and capitalizes on classical architectures' robustness and Grover's quadratic speedup in high-dimensional search spaces to significantly reduce test loss (58.75%) and improve test accuracy (35.25%), compared to classical NN weight optimization, on small datasets. Unlike most QNNs that are trained on small datasets only, our method is also scalable, as it allows the optimization of deep networks; for an NN with 3 hidden layers, trained on the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, we obtained a mean accuracy of 97.7%. Moreover, our method requires a much smaller number of qubits compared to other QNN approaches, making it very practical for near-future quantum computers that will still deliver a limited number of logical qubits.</description>

      <title>Photonic Qubit Gates via 1D Scattering from an Array of Two-Level Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computing offers a promising platform for quantum information processing, benefiting from the long coherence times of photons and their ease of manipulation. This paper presents a scheme for implementing a deterministic phase gate for dual-rail number encoded photonic qubits, leveraging a standard 1D waveguide coupled to an array of two-level emitters (TLE). Using a transfer matrix approach, we develop a protocol for deterministic phase gate operation, demonstrating its robustness against non-waveguide mode coupling and disorder. Finally, we relax the idealized assumption of monochromatic light, considering finite-bandwidth pulses. Despite these realistic considerations, our results indicate high fidelity for the proposed phase gate protocol. Finally we will discuss two qubit operations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical basis of measurement-device-independent quantum-key-distribution with asymmetric sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has been a promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the overall performance when two arbitrary and asymmetric sources the MDI users employ. As a specific application, we calculate the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare this result to the cases with symmetric sources. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources. Since requiring all users to employ identical sources in a network is unreasonable, our theory paves the way for the practical deployment of MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting quantum information using quantum error correction (QEC) requires repeatedly measuring stabilizers to extract error syndromes that are used to identify and correct errors. Syndrome extraction data provides information about the processes that cause errors. The collective effects of these processes can be described by a detector error model (DEM). We show how to estimate probabilities of individual DEM events, and of aggregated classes of DEM events, using data from multiple cycles of syndrome extraction.</description>

      <title>Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature Via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14685v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of quantum measurements presents a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics, with concepts such as the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), and Bohmian Mechanics (BM) offering distinct perspectives. We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI), which describes measurement as branching the local Hilbert space of a system into parallel subspaces. We formalize the mathematical framework of BHSI using branching and the engaging and disengaging unitary operators to relationally and causally update the states of observers. Unlike the MWI, BHSI avoids the ontological proliferation of worlds and copies of observers, realizing the Born rule based on branch weights. Unlike the CI, BHSI retains the essential features of the MWI: unitary evolution and no wavefunction collapse. Unlike the BM, BHSI does not depend on a nonlocal structure, which may conflict with relativity. We apply BHSI to examples such as the double-slit experiment, the Bell test, Wagner and his friend, and the black hole information paradox. In addition, we explore whether recohering branches can be achieved in BHSI. Compared to the CI and MWI, BHSI provides a minimalist, unitarity-preserving, collapse-free, and probabilistically inherent alternative interpretation of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithm for the Poisson equation based on the banded Toeplitz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For solving the Poisson equation it is usually possible to discretize it into solving the corresponding linear system $Ax=b$.Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for the discreted Poisson equation have been studied before. We give a VQA based on the banded Toeplitz systems for solving the Poisson equation with respect to the structural features of matrix $A$. In detail, we decompose the matrix $A$ and $A^2$ into a linear combination of the corresponding banded Toeplitz matrix and sparse matrices with only a few non-zero elements. For the one-dimensional Poisson equation with different boundary conditions and the $d$-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the number of decomposition terms is less than the work in [Phys. Rev. A 108, 032418 (2023)]. Based on the decomposition of the matrix, we design quantum circuits that evaluate efficiently the cost function.Additionally, numerical simulation verifies the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. In the end, the VQAs for linear systems of equations and matrix-vector multiplications with $K$-banded Teoplitz matrix $T_n^K$ are given, where $T_n^K\in R^{n\times n}$ and $K\in O({\rm ploy}\log n)$.</description>

      <title>(Sub)Exponential Quantum Speedup for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate provable (sub)exponential quantum speedups in both discrete and continuous optimization, achieved through simple and natural quantum optimization algorithms, namely the quantum adiabatic algorithm for discrete optimization and quantum Hamiltonian descent for continuous optimization. Our result builds on the Gily\'en--Hastings--Vazirani (sub)exponential oracle separation for adiabatic quantum computing. With a sequence of perturbative reductions, we compile their construction into two standalone objective functions, whose oracles can be directly leveraged by the plain adiabatic evolution and Schr\"odinger operator evolution for discrete and continuous optimization, respectively.</description>

      <title>Parallel Kac's Walk Generates PRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ma and Huang recently proved that the PFC construction, introduced by Metger, Poremba, Sinha and Yuen [MPSY24], gives an adaptive-secure pseudorandom unitary family PRU. Their proof developed a new path recording technique [MH24].
  In this work, we show that a linear number of sequential repetitions of the parallel Kac's Walk, introduced by Lu, Qin, Song, Yao and Zhao [LQSY+24], also forms an adaptive-secure PRU, confirming a conjecture therein. Moreover, it additionally satisfies strong security against adversaries making inverse queries. This gives an alternative PRU construction, and provides another instance demonstrating the power of the path recording technique. We also discuss some further simplifications and implications.</description>

      <title>Advancing quantum process tomography through universal compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for characterizing operations in quantum gates and circuits, however, existing methods face scalability and noise sensitivity challenges. Here, we propose a QPT approach based on universal compilation, which systematically decomposes quantum processes into optimized Kraus operators and Choi matrices. This method utilizes efficient algorithms to improve accuracy while reducing resource requirements. We benchmark our approach through numerical simulations of random unitary gates, demonstrating highly accurate quantum process characterization. Additionally, we apply it to dephasing processes with time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous noise, achieving improved fidelity and robustness. Our work further enables broader applications in quantum error correction and device validation.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal photon blockade induced by parametric amplification in an asymmetrical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate and manipulate nonreciprocal photon blockade effect in an asymmetrical Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity, which consists of a single two-level atom and a second-order nonlinear medium. By utilizing the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of cavity and applying a parametric amplification pumping laser to the nonlinear medium, we can realize direction-dependent single-photon and two-photon blockade effects. For nonreciprocal single-photon blockade, our proposal is robust across a wide range of parameters, such as the cavity or atomic detuning, coupling strength, and atomic decay. Within similar parameter ranges, nonreciprocal two-photon blockade can be achieved and modulated by finely adjusting the parametric amplification pumping. Our project offers a feasible access to generating high-quality and tunable nonreciprocal single/two-photon source and paves a new avenue for investigating the nonreciprocity of photon quantum statistical properties.</description>

      <title>Trainable Quantum Neural Network for Multiclass Image Classification with the Power of Pre-trained Tree Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) offer powerful models for image classification. While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.</description>

      <title>Quantum pseudoresources imply cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While one-way functions (OWFs) serve as the minimal assumption for computational cryptography in the classical setting, in quantum cryptography, we have even weaker cryptographic assumptions such as pseudo-random states, and EFI pairs, among others. Moreover, the minimal assumption for computational quantum cryptography remains an open question. Recently, it has been shown that pseudoentanglement is necessary for the existence of quantum cryptography (Goul\~ao and Elkouss 2024), but no cryptographic construction has been built from it.
  In this work, we study the cryptographic usefulness of quantum pseudoresources -- a pair of families of quantum states that exhibit a gap in their resource content yet remain computationally indistinguishable. We show that quantum pseudoresources imply a variant of EFI pairs, which we call EPFI pairs, and that these are equivalent to quantum commitments and thus EFI pairs. Our results suggest that, just as randomness is fundamental to classical cryptography, quantum resources may play a similarly crucial role in the quantum setting.
  Finally, we focus on the specific case of entanglement, analyzing different definitions of pseudoentanglement and their implications for constructing EPFI pairs. Moreover, we propose a new cryptographic functionality that is intrinsically dependent on entanglement as a resource.</description>

      <title>Automated discovery and optimization of autonomous quantum error correction codes for a general open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to search for the optimal code space, induced decay rates and control Hamiltonian to implement autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) for a general open quantum system. The system is defined by a free-evolution Lindbladian superoperator, which contains the free Hamiltonian and naturally occurring decoherence terms, as well as the control superoperators. The performance metric for optimization is the fidelity between the projector onto the code space and the same projector after Lindbladian evolution for a specified time. We use a gradient-based search to update the code words, induced decay matrix and control Hamiltonian matrix. We apply the method to optimize AQEC codes for a variety of few-level systems. The four-level system with uniform decay rates offers a simple example for testing and illustrating the operation of our approach. The algorithm reliably succeeds in finding the optimal code in this case, while success becomes probabilistic for more complicated cases. For a five-level system with photon loss decay, the algorithm finds good AQEC codes, but these codes are not as good as the well-known binomial code. We use the binomial code as a starting point to search for the optimal code for a perturbed five-level system. In this case, the algorithm finds a code that is better than both the original binomial code and any other code obtained numerically when starting from a random initial guess.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraction of energy is one of fundamental challenges in realizing quantum batteries (QBs). Here, we propose two wireless transfer schemes with parity-time symmetries to efficiently extract the energy stored in non-Hermitian QBs to consumption centers. For linear cases, the transfer energy oscillates periodically in the unbroken symmetry region and grows hyperbolically in the broken region. For nonlinear cases, the transfer energy eventually reach and remain steady-state values arising from the feedback mechanism of the nonlinear saturable gain. Furthermore, we show the significant robustness and the ultrafast response of the wireless transfer schemes to sudden movements around one metre. Our work overcomes energy bottlenecks for wireless transfer schemes in QBs and may provide inspirations for practical applications of QBs.</description>

Abstract: I present my perspective on sensing with quantum light. I summarise the motivations and methodology for identifying quantum enhancements in sensing over a classical sensor. In the real world, this enhancement will be a constant factor, and not increase with the size of the quantum probe as is often advertised. I use a limited survey of interferometry, microscopy, and spectroscopy to extract the vital challenges that must be faced to realise tangible enhancements in sensing with quantum light.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Effect in the Gouy Phase of Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Gouy phase emerging from the time evolution of confined matter waves in a harmonic potential. Specifically, we analyze the quantum dynamics of a Gaussian wavepacket that exhibits position--momentum correlations. By tuning the parameters governing its evolution, we reveal intriguing effects, with a particular focus on squeezing. Notably, during the wavepacket evolution quantum spreading and squeezing processes emerge, giving rise to Gouy phase contributions of $\pi/4$ rad, establishing a clear link between the Gouy phase and a purely quantum phenomenon. Furthermore, the interplay between wavepacket squeezing and one-dimensional spreading leads to a total Gouy phase accumulation of $\pi/2$ rad in an oscillation period. Both squeezing and Gouy phase have individually proven valuable in state engineering and quantum metrology. By demonstrating a direct, controllable relationship between these two fundamental processes, our findings expand the realm of quantum-enhanced technologies, including quantum sensing and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of Clifford circuits with small Markovian errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulation of noisy quantum circuits is essential for understanding quantum computing experiments. It enables scalable error characterization, analysis of how noise impacts quantum algorithms, and optimized implementations of quantum error correction. However, most existing efficient simulation techniques can only simulate the effects of stochastic (incoherent) noise. The lack of efficient ways to simulate coherent errors, which are common and significant in contemporary quantum computing systems, has frustrated research. We remedy this gap by introducing an efficient algorithm for approximate simulation of Clifford circuits with arbitrary small errors (including coherent errors) that can be described by sparse $n$-qubit Lindbladians. We use this algorithm to study the impact of coherent errors on syndrome extract circuits for distance-3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 rotated surface codes, and on deep random 225-qubit circuits containing over a million gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key application in quantum communication, enabling secure key exchange between parties using quantum states. Twin-field (TF) QKD offers a promising solution that surpasses the repeaterless limits, and its measurement-device-independent nature makes it suitable for star-type network architectures. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fully connected TF-QKD network architecture, where users prepare quantum signals and send them to network nodes. These nodes use splitters to route the signals to measurement units, enabling secure key distribution among arbitrary users. A proof-of-principle demonstration with three users successfully achieved secure key sharing over simulated link losses of up to 30 dB, with an average rate of $5.01 \times 10^{-7}$ bit per pulse. Additionally, simulations show that the architecture can support up to $32$ users with a secure key rate of 280.90 bits/s under typical fiber loss conditions. This approach represents a significant advancement in the topology of untrusted-node QKD networks and holds promise for practical, large-scale applications in secure communication.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down Quantum Compilation: Profiling and Identifying Costly Passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of quantum systems, the efficient, practical execution of quantum programs is becoming more critical. Each execution includes compilation time, which accounts for substantial overhead of the overall program runtime. To address this challenge, proposals that leverage precompilation techniques have emerged, whereby entire circuits or select components are precompiled to mitigate the compilation time spent during execution. Considering the impact of compilation time on quantum program execution, identifying the contribution of each individual compilation task to the execution time is necessary in directing the community's research efforts towards the development of an efficient compilation and execution pipeline. In this work, we perform a preliminary analysis of the quantum circuit compilation process in Qiskit, examining the cumulative runtime of each individual compilation task and identifying the tasks that most strongly impact the overall compilation time. Our results indicate that, as the desired level of optimization increases, circuit optimization and gate synthesis passes become the dominant tasks in compiling a Quantum Fourier Transform, with individual passes consuming up to 87% of the total compilation time. Mapping passes require the most compilation time for a GHZ state preparation circuit, accounting for over 99% of total compilation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum many-body systems faces the difficulty that in a realistic scenario only few control parameters of the system may be accessible. In this context, an interesting connection between the energy fluctuations during state preparation and its geometric length as measured by the Fubini-Study metric was discussed in Bukov et al., "Geometric Speed Limit of Accessible Many-Body State Preparation", Phys. Rev. X 9, 011034 (2019). An inspiring conjecture was put forward lower bounding the energy fluctuations by the minimal geometric length of all accessible state preparation protocols. We here show that the conjecture holds if the accessible parameter space has no extrinsic curvature, when embedded into the space of all dynamically accessible states. If the parameter space has extrinsic curvature a weakened version of the conjecture applies. We discuss instructive examples for a qubit system and harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Multiple Quantum Many-Body Clustering Probed by Dynamical Decoupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of quantum information in large systems requires precise control of quantum systems that are out-of-equilibrium. As the size of the system increases, its fragility in response to external perturbations and intrinsic decoherence processes also increases. The degradation of the system response makes accurate measurements a challenging and time-consuming task. However, quantum information lifetime enhancement can be achieved by dynamical decoupling techniques (DD), where an external drive with a frequency much higher than the system's internal evolution renders signal acquisition with decay times greater than 1000-fold. In this study, we demonstrate that the system response during a prethermal period, subject to Floquet control, can be utilized to probe the multiple quantum evolution of dense and highly connected spin systems. This approach exhibits an enhanced sensitivity at a reduced experimental time. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio achieved enabled the use of numerical inversion strategies to model the evolution of the excited multiple quantum coherences, which describe the number of correlated spins within a cluster. We observed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the increase in the number of correlated spins with multiple quantum evolution is accompanied by an increase in the distribution of spin cluster sizes, which follows a quadratic law.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for simulating the dynamics of an open electronic system on a quantum computer. This approach entails mid-circuit measurements and resets to simulate the addition or removal of fermions from the system and provides a way to apply non-reversible operations to a quantum computer. Using this method, we simulate the dynamics of an open electronic system consisting of a fermionic chain positioned between two conductive leads on the $ibm\_torino$ quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase discrimination with applications to quantum search on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase discrimination problem, in which we want to decide whether the eigenphase $\theta\in(-\pi,\pi]$ of a given eigenstate $|\psi\rangle$ with eigenvalue $e^{i\theta}$ is zero or not, using applications of the unitary $U$ provided as a black box oracle.We propose a quantum algorithm named {\it quantum phase discrimination(QPD)} for this task, with optimal query complexity $\Theta(\frac{1}{\lambda}\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ to the oracle $U$, where $\lambda$ is the gap between zero and non-zero eigenphases and $\delta$ the allowed one-sided error. The quantum circuit is simple, consisting of only one ancillary qubit and a sequence of controlled-$U$ interleaved with single qubit $Y$ rotations, whose angles are given by a simple analytical formula. Quantum phase discrimination could become a fundamental subroutine in other quantum algorithms, as we present two applications to quantum search on graphs:
  i) Spatial search on graphs. Inspired by the structure of QPD, we propose a new quantum walk model, and based on them we tackle the spatial search problem, obtaining a novel quantum search algorithm. For any graph with any number of marked vertices, the quantum algorithm that can find a marked vertex with probability $\Omega(1)$ in total evolution time $ O(\frac{1}{\lambda \sqrt{\varepsilon}})$ and query complexity $ O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$, where $\lambda$ is the gap between the zero and non-zero eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian and $\varepsilon$ is a lower bound on the proportion of marked vertices.
  ii) Path-finding on graphs.} By using QPD, we reduce the query complexity of a path-finding algorithm proposed by Li and Zur [arxiv: 2311.07372] from $\tilde{O}(n^{11})$ to $\tilde{O}(n^8)$, in a welded-tree circuit graph with $\Theta(n2^n)$ vertices.
  Besides these two applications, we argue that more quantum algorithms might benefit from QPD.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atoms in a Ladder Geometry: Quench Dynamics and Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as novel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to particle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct test of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics starting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the fate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\Omega$ and a detuning profile which is staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\Delta$. As the staggering strength $\Delta$ is tuned from $\Delta/\Omega=0\rightarrow\infty$, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i) quantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\Delta/\Omega \sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\Delta/\Omega \gg 1$) . Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of this model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact Floquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical features against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols, long-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the environment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the Rydberg excited state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon processes are crucial in applications like microscopy and microfabrication, but their low cross-section requires intense illumination and limits, e.g., the penetration depth in nonlinear microscopy. Entangled states have been proposed to enhance the efficiency of two-photon interactions and have shown effectiveness at low intensities. This quantum enhancement is generally believed to be lost at high intensities, for more than one photon per mode, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explored experimentally and theoretically two-photon processes driven by entangled photons at intensities beyond this threshold and compared the results with the classical case. We found that a quantum advantage can still be observed at nearly one order of magnitude higher intensities than previously assumed. Our findings show a potential path for exploiting quantum-enhanced two-photon processes in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband Fourier transform spectroscopy of quantum emitters photoluminescence with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast timescales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Realization of maximally-entangling two-qutrit gates using the Cross-Resonance scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-level systems have natural advantages over their two-level counterparts in quantum information and computation. Although generally used for qubits, the existing superconducting transmon architecture can naturally be extended to three levels, which allows the exploration of the entire qutrit Hilbert space. Realizing a maximally entangling two-qutrit gate is necessary for universal quantum computation using three-level systems. Our work extends the state-of-the-art approach by providing a theoretical framework for realizing a high-fidelity two-qutrit generalized CR gate using the cross-resonance framework. Using our framework, we experimentally demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$\sqrt{X}$ gates through simulations on QISKIT dynamics, which in turn allow us to obtain a maximum extracted concurrence of $97.2\pm0.1\%$, thereby demonstrating that entanglement has been achieved on all three levels. Using the above gates, we also prepare a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $96.9\pm 0.1\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a $0.611$-approximation algorithm for Quantum MaxCut and a $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809$-approximation algorithm for the EPR Hamiltonian of [arXiv:2209.02589]. A novel ingredient in both of these algorithms is to partially entangle pairs of qubits associated to edges in a matching, while preserving the direction of their single-qubit Bloch vectors. This allows us to interpolate between product states and matching-based states with a tunable parameter.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Rydberg Gates via Spatial Blockade Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-target gates offer the potential to reduce gate depth in syndrome extraction for quantum error correction. Although neutral-atom quantum computers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that avoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to single-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\otimes N}) gates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control and have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages tailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the control and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we design smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up to 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom placement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path to implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly reducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the ladder operators typical of quantum mechanics are used to construct an operatorial version of a model dubbed crimo-taxis. In a classical framework, the crimo-taxis model is described by reaction-diffusion partial differential equations describing a population divided into three interacting subgroups (ordinary citizens, drug users/dealers, and law enforcement personnel). By means of a quantum-like approach, these interacting subgroups are modeled using annihilation, creation, and number fermionic operators. Their dynamics is governed by a self-adjoint and time-independent Hamiltonian operator, emboding the interactions among the groups. Furthermore, a recent variant of the standard Heisenberg approach, namely $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics, is also taken into account with the goal of enriching the dynamics. The results of some numerical simulations in a one--dimensional setting are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Diffraction Barrier for Passive Sources: Parameter-Decoupled Superresolution Assisted by Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parameter-decoupled superresolution framework for estimating sub-wavelength separations of passive two-point sources without requiring prior knowledge or control of the source. Our theoretical foundation circumvents the need to estimate multiple challenging parameters such as partial coherence, brightness imbalance, random relative phase, and photon statistics. A physics-informed machine learning (ML) model (trained with a standard desktop workstation), synergistically integrating this theory, further addresses practical imperfections including background noise, photon loss, and centroid/orientation misalignment. The integrated parameter-decoupling superresolution method achieves resolution 14 and more times below the diffraction limit (corresponding to ~ 13.5 nm in optical microscopy) on experimentally generated realistic images with &gt;82% fidelity, performance rivaling state-of-the-art techniques for actively controllable sources. Critically, our method's robustness against source parameter variability and source-independent noises enables potential applications in realistic scenarios where source control is infeasible, such as astrophysical imaging, live-cell microscopy, and quantum metrology. This work bridges a critical gap between theoretical superresolution limits and practical implementations for passive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refinement is an influential technique used in the verification and development of computer programs. It provides a systematic and rigorous approach to software development through stepwise refinement, where a high-level abstract specification is progressively transformed into an implementation that meets the desired requirements. Central to this technique is the notion of a refinement order, which ensures that each refinement step preserves program correctness. Different orders can be defined with respect to partial and total correctness, as well as for deterministic and nondeterministic programs. In the realm of quantum programs, the theory becomes even more intricate due to the existence of various quantum state predicates, leading to different notions of specifications. This paper thoroughly explores different refinement orders for quantum programs and examines the relationships between them.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$. We prove a dichotomy theorem that a single relation sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system is non-integrable, or (ii) the lowest-order Yang-Baxter equation is satisfied. This result solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture stating that a model is integrable only if this model has a 3-local conserved quantity. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spread complexity of a generic two-level subsystem of a larger system to analyze the influence of energy level statistics, comparing chaotic and integrable systems. Initially focusing on the nearest-neighbor level spacing, we observe the characteristic slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure. Further investigation reveals that certain matrix models exhibit additional iterative peaks, motivating us to generalize the known spacing distributions to higher-order level spacings. While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of the superfluid-insulator transition for a mesoscopic atomtronic ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a phase-space perspective for the analysis of the superfluid-insulator transition for finite-size Bose-Hubbard circuits. We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional ``level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates</title>

Abstract: A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Chemical Bonding of Lanthanide-OH Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the low lying adiabatic relativistic electronic states of lanthanide monohydroxide (Ln-OH) molecules near their linear equilibrium geometries. We focus on heavy, magnetic DyOH and ErOH relevant to fundamental symmetry tests. We use a restricted-active-space self-consistent field method combined with spin-orbit coupling as well as a relativistic coupled-cluster method. In addition, electric dipole and magnetic moments are computed with the self-consistent field method. Analysis of the results from both methods shows that the dominant molecular configuration of the ground state is one where an electron from the partially filled and submerged 4f orbital of the lanthanide atom moves to the hydroxyl group, leaving the closed outer-most 6s$^2$ lone electron pair of the lanthanide atom intact in sharp contrast to the bonding in alkaline-earth monohydroxides and YbOH, where an electron from the outer-most s shell moves to the hydroxyl group. For linear molecules the projection of the total electron angular momentum on the symmetry axis is a conserved quantity with quantum number $\Omega$ and we study the polynomial $\Omega$ dependence of the energies of the ground states as well as their electric and magnetic moments. We find that the lowest energy states have $|\Omega|=15/2$ and 1/2 for DyOH and ErOH, respectively. The zero field splittings among these $\Omega$ states is approximately $hc\times 1\,000$~cm$^{-1}$. We find that the permanent dipole moments for both triatomics are fairly small at 0.23 atomic units. The magnetic moments are closely related to that of the corresponding atomic Ln$^+$ ion in an excited electronic state. We also realize that the total electron angular momentum is to good approximation conserved and has a quantum number of 15/2 for both triatomic molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric framework for modeling learning dynamics in physical, biological, and machine learning systems. The theory reveals three fundamental regimes, each emerging from the power-law relationship $g \propto \kappa^a$ between the metric tensor $g$ in the space of trainable variables and the noise covariance matrix $\kappa$. The quantum regime corresponds to $a = 1$ and describes Schr\"odinger-like dynamics that emerges from a discrete shift symmetry. The efficient learning regime corresponds to $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and describes very fast machine learning algorithms. The equilibration regime corresponds to $a = 0$ and describes classical models of biological evolution. We argue that the emergence of the intermediate regime $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a key mechanism underlying the emergence of biological complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Converting $PT$-Symmetric Topological Classes by Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Going beyond the conventional classification rule of Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, $PT$ symmetric topological phases are classified by $(PT)^2=1$ or $-1$. The interconversion between the two $PT$-symmetric topological classes is generally difficult due to the constraint of $(PT)^2$. Here, we propose a scheme to control and interconvert the $PT$-symmetric topological classes by Floquet engineering. We find that it is the breakdown of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge, induced by the $\pi$ phase difference between different hopping rates, by the periodic driving that leads to such an interconversion. Relaxing the system from the constraint of $(PT)^2$, rich exotic topological phases, e.g., the coexisting $PT$-symmetric first-order real Chern insulator and second-order topological insulators not only in different quasienergy gaps, but also in one single gap, are generated. In contrast to conventional Floquet topological phases, our result provides a way to realize exotic topological phases without changing symmetries. It enriches the family of topological phases and gives an insightful guidance for the development of multifunctional quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

Abstract: Exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in an external non-Abelian gauge field with an SU(N) symmetry group have been obtained. The external field is a solution of the Yang-Mills equations and describes a plane wave on the light cone.

      <title>Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale.</description>

      <title>Failure of the comformal-map method for relativistic quantum billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the conformal-map method introduced by Robnik in 1984 for nonrelativistic quantum billiards is not applicable for the quantization of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs) consisting of a massless non-interacting spin-1/2 particle confined to a two-dimensional domain. To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are corroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic quantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of the properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically derive transfer probabilities and efficiencies for an artificial light-harvesting photosynthetic system, which consists of a ring coupled to a central acceptor. For an incident photon pair, we find near-perfect single excitation transfer efficiency with negligible double excitation transfer in the weak coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, single excitation transfer efficiency was greater than 90%, while the double excitation efficiency was approximately 50%. We have found that the three main factors which determine high transfer efficiencies are large acceptor probabilities, long acceptor decay times, and strong photon-ring coupling. A possible implementation of the theoretical framework to bio-inspired solar energy devices is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremal problems on set systems with restricted intersections have been an important part of combinatorics in the last 70 year. In this paper, we study the following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\subseteq \{0,\dots,k-1\}$ and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not contain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size in $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on $m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum computing.
  As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\"uredi's celebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system method. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on the uniformity in F\"uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with significantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is still strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method.</description>

      <title>Impact of dynamics, entanglement, and Markovian noise on the fidelity of few-qubit digital quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have been proposed to accelerate the simulation of the chaotic dynamical systems that are ubiquitous in the physics of plasmas. Quantum computers without error correction might even use noise to their advantage to calculate the Lyapunov exponent by measuring the Loschmidt echo fidelity decay rate. For the first time, digital Hamiltonian simulations of the quantum sawtooth map, performed on the {IBM-Q} quantum hardware platform, show that the fidelity decay rate of a digital quantum simulation increases during the transition from dynamical localization to chaotic diffusion in the map. The observed error per \code{CNOT} gate increases by $1.5\times$ as the dynamics varies from localized to diffusive, while only changing the phases of virtual \code{RZ} gates and keeping the over-all gate count constant. A gate-based Lindblad noise model that captures the effective change in relaxation and dephasing errors during gate operation qualitatively explains the effect of dynamics on fidelity as being due to the localization and entanglement of the states created. Specifically, highly delocalized states that are entangled with random phases show an increased sensitivity to dephasing and, on average, a similar sensitivity to relaxation as localized states. In contrast, delocalized unentangled states show an increased sensitivity to dephasing but a lower sensitivity to relaxation. This gate-based Lindblad model is shown to be a useful benchmarking tool by estimating the effective Lindblad coherence times during \code{CNOT} gates and finding a consistent $2\text{--}3\times$ shorter $T_2$ time than reported for idle qubits. Thus, the interplay of the dynamics of a simulation with the noise processes that are active can strongly influence the overall fidelity decay rate.</description>

      <title>Strong Converse Bounds for Compression of Mixed States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study strong converse properties for both visible and blind compression of mixed states. The optimal rate of a visible compression scheme is obtained in terms of the entanglement of purification, whose additivity remains unknown so far. For a variation of extendible states, we prove that the entanglement of purification is additive and apply this to obtain a "pretty strong" converse bound for the blind and visible compression of such states. Namely, when the rate decreases below the optimal rate, the error exhibits a discontinuous jump from 0 to at least $\frac{1}{3\sqrt{2}}$.
  To deal with the visible case for general states, we define a new quantity $E_{\alpha,p}(A:R)_{\rho}$ for a bipartite state $\rho^{AR}$ and $\alpha \in (0,1)\cup (1,\infty)$ as the $\alpha$-R\'enyi generalization of the entanglement of purification $E_{p}(A:R)_{\rho}$. For $\alpha=1$, we define $E_{1,p}(A:R)_{\rho}:=E_{p}(A:R)_{\rho}$. We show that for any rate below the regularization $\lim_{\alpha \to 1^+}E_{\alpha,p}^{\infty}(A:R)_{\rho}:=\lim_{\alpha \to 1^+} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{E_{\alpha,p}(A^n:R^n)_{\rho^{\otimes n}}}{n}$ the fidelity for the visible compression exponentially converges to zero.
  Moreover, we consider blind compression of a general mixed-state source $\rho^{AR}$ shared between an encoder and an inaccessible reference system $R$. We obtain a strong converse bound for the compression of this source by assuming that the decoder is a super-unital channel. This immediately implies a strong converse for the blind compression of ensembles of mixed states, by assuming a super-unital decoder, as this is a special case of the general mixed-state source $\rho^{AR}$ where the reference system $R$ has a classical structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics as a pseudo-density matrix</title>

Abstract: While in relativity theory space evolves over time into a single entity known as spacetime, quantum theory lacks a standard notion of how to encapsulate the dynamical evolution of a quantum state into a single "state over time". Recently it was emphasized in the work of Fitzsimons, Jones and Vedral that if such a state over time is to encode not only spatial but also temporal correlations which exist within a quantum dynamical process, then it should be represented not by a density matrix, but rather, by a pseudo-density matrix. A pseudo-density matrix is a hermitian matrix of unit trace whose marginals are density matrices, and in this work, we make use a factorization system for quantum channels to associate a pseudo-density matrix with a quantum system which is to evolve according to a finite sequence of quantum channels. We then view such a pseudo-density matrix as the quantum analog of a local patch of spacetime, and we make an in-depth mathematical analysis of such quantum dynamical pseudo-density matrices and the properties they satisfy. We also show how to explicitly extract quantum dynamics from a given pseudo-density matrix, thus solving an open problem posed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum phase transition of a Josephson junction coupled to a high-impedance multimode resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment is a long-standing fundamental problem at the center of an intense debate, strongly revived by the advent of superconducting platforms with high-impedance multimode resonators. Here we investigate the emergent criticality of a junction coupled to a multimode resonator when the number of modes is increased. We demonstrate how the multimode environment renormalizes the Josephson and capacitive energies of the junction so that in the thermodynamic limit the charging energy dominates when the impedance is larger than the resistance quantum and is negligible otherwise, independently from the bare ratio between the two energy scales and the compact or extended nature of the phase of the junction. Via exact diagonalization, we find that the transition surprisingly stems from a level anticrossing involving not the ground state, but the first excited state, whose energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We clarify the nature of the two phases by pointing at a different behaviour of the ground and excited states and we show that at the transition point the spectrum displays universality not only at low frequencies. In agreement with recent experiments, we reveal striking spectral signatures of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the \textit{patterns}, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order R\'enyi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Propagation in Integrable Heisenberg Chains from a New Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact single-magnon entanglement evolution in Heisenberg chains is obtained using the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) formulation. A dual, i.e., frequency and time-domain, analysis shows that the transient dynamics of individual spins' entanglement is described via a Bessel function of the first kind. Through QCTF, we bypass the evaluation of the full system's state for the purpose of obtaining entanglement. Although it is known that the observable entanglement edge is formed by the arrival of a stream of quasi-particles that travel with the maximum group velocity, we show how the early quasi-particles travel faster than the maximum group velocity of the chain and contribute to entanglement production. Our results can be extended to the multi-magnon regime, therefore opening up the means to better interpret equilibration dynamics and thermodynamics in Heisenberg chains.</description>

      <title>Efficient separate quantification of state preparation errors and measurement errors on quantum computers and their mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current noisy quantum computers have multiple types of errors, which can occur in the state preparation, measurement/readout, and gate operation, as well as intrinsic decoherence and relaxation. Partly motivated by the booming of intermediate-scale quantum processors, measurement and gate errors have been recently extensively studied, and several methods of mitigating them have been proposed and formulated in software packages (e.g., in IBM Qiskit). Despite this, the state preparation error and the procedure to quantify it have not yet been standardized, as state preparation and measurement errors are usually considered not directly separable. Inspired by a recent work of Laflamme, Lin, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 106, 012439 (2022)], we propose a simple and resource-efficient approach to quantify separately the state preparation and readout error rates. With these two errors separately quantified, we also propose methods to mitigate them separately, especially mitigating state preparation errors with linear (with the number of qubits) complexity. As a result of the separate mitigation, we show that the fidelity of the outcome can be improved by an order of magnitude compared to the standard measurement error mitigation scheme. We also show that the quantification and mitigation scheme is resilient against gate noise and can be immediately applied to current noisy quantum computers. To demonstrate this, we present results from cloud experiments on IBM's superconducting quantum computers. The results indicate that the state preparation error rate is also an important metric for qubit metrology that can be efficiently obtained.</description>

Abstract: Tunneling is an iconic concept that captures the peculiarity of quantum dynamics but, despite its ubiquity, questions remain. We focus on strong-field tunneling, which is vital to all attosecond science. We find an unexpected optical tunneling event that happens when the instantaneous electric field vanishes and there is no barrier. This event arises from a color switchover in a strongly polychromatic field. The tunneling without a barrier reveals the disconnect between the standard intuition built on the picture of a quasistatic barrier and the nonadiabatic nature of the process.</description>

      <title>QRCC: Evaluating Large Quantum Circuits on Small Quantum Computers through Integrated Qubit Reuse and Circuit Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has recently emerged as a promising computing paradigm for many application domains. However, the size of quantum circuits that can be run with high fidelity is constrained by the limited quantity and quality of physical qubits. Recently proposed schemes, such as wire cutting and qubit reuse, mitigate the problem but produce sub-optimal results as they address the problem individually. In addition, gate cutting, an alternative circuit-cutting strategy that is suitable for circuits computing expectation values, has not been fully explored in the field.
  In this paper, we propose QRCC, an integrated approach that exploits qubit reuse and circuit-cutting (including wire cutting and gate cutting) to run large circuits on small quantum computers. Circuit-cutting techniques introduce non-negligible post-processing overhead, which increases exponentially with the number of cuts. QRCC exploits qubit reuse to find better cutting solutions to minimize the cut numbers and thus the post-processing overhead. Our evaluation results show that on average we reduce the number of cuts by 29% and additional reduction when considering gate cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum features? To answer this question we derive quantum speed limits for two-time correlation functions arising from statistics of measurements. Generally, these two-time correlators are described by quasiprobabilities, if the initial quantum state of the system does not commute with the measurement observables. Our quantum speed limits are derived from the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation, and set the minimal time at which a quasiprobability can become non-positive, which is evidence for the onset of non-classical traits in the system dynamics. As an illustrative example, we apply these results to a conditional quantum gate, by determining the optimal condition giving rise to non-classicality at maximum speed. Our analysis also hints at boosted power extraction in genuinely non-classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Barren plateaus are amplified by the dimension of qudits</title>

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as pivotal strategies for attaining quantum advantage in diverse scientific and technological domains, notably within Quantum Neural Networks. However, despite their potential, VQAs encounter significant obstacles, chief among them being the vanishing gradient problem, commonly referred to as barren plateaus. In this article, through meticulous analysis, we demonstrate that existing literature implicitly suggests the intrinsic influence of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. To instantiate these findings, we present numerical results that exemplify the impact of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. Therefore, despite the proposition of various error mitigation techniques, our results call for further scrutiny about their efficacy in the context of VQAs with qudits.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Circuit Size for Sparse Quantum State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental and significant subroutine in quantum computing. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on the circuit size (the total count of elementary gates in the circuit) for sparse quantum state preparation. A quantum state is said to be $d$-sparse if it has only $d$ non-zero amplitudes. For the task of preparing an $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum state, we obtain the following results:
  \textbf{Without ancillary qubits:} Any $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum state can be prepared by a quantum circuit of size $O(\frac{nd}{\log n} + n)$ without using ancillary qubits, which improves the previous best results. It is asymptotically optimal when $d = \mathrm{poly}(n)$, and this optimality holds for a broader scope under some reasonable assumptions.
  \textbf{With limited ancillary qubits:} (i) Based on the first result, we prove for the first time a trade-off between the number of ancillary qubits and the circuit size: any $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum state can be prepared by a quantum circuit of size $O(\frac{nd}{\log (n + m)} + n)$ using $m$ ancillary qubits for any $m \in O(\frac{nd}{\log nd} + n)$.
  (ii) We establish a matching lower bound $\Omega(\frac{nd}{\log {(n + m)} }+ n)$ under some reasonable assumptions, and obtain a slightly weaker lower bound $\Omega(\frac{nd}{\log {(n + m)} + \log d} + n)$ without any assumptions.
  \textbf{With unlimited ancillary qubits:} Given arbitrary amount of ancillary qubits available, the circuit size for preparing $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum states is $\Theta(\frac{nd}{\log nd} + n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

      <title>Interior Point Methods for Structured Quantum Relative Entropy Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy optimization refers to a class of convex problems in which a linear functional is minimized over an affine section of the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy function. Recently, the self-concordance of a natural barrier function was proved for this set, and various implementations of interior-point methods have been made available to solve this class of optimization problems. In this paper, we show how common structures arising from applications in quantum information theory can be exploited to improve the efficiency of solving quantum relative entropy optimization problems using interior-point methods. First, we show that the natural barrier function for the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy composed with positive linear operators is self-concordant, even when these linear operators map to singular matrices. Compared to modelling problems using the full quantum relative entropy cone, this allows us to remove redundant log-determinant expressions from the barrier function and reduce the overall barrier parameter. Second, we show how certain slices of the quantum relative entropy cone exhibit useful properties which should be exploited whenever possible to perform certain key steps of interior-point methods more efficiently. We demonstrate how these methods can be applied to applications in quantum information theory, including quantifying quantum key rates, quantum rate-distortion functions, quantum channel capacities, and the ground state energy of Hamiltonians. Our numerical results show that these techniques improve computation times by up to several orders of magnitude, and allow previously intractable problems to be solved.</description>

Abstract: Radiation-pressure interactions between harmonic oscillators have enabled exquisite measurement precision and control, made possible by using strong sideband drives, enhancing the coupling rate while also linearizing the interaction. In this letter, we demonstrate a strong intrinsic longitudinal coupling, a circuit quantum electrodynamics analogue of the radiation-pressure interaction, between a transmon qubit and a linear microwave resonator. A red-detuned sideband drive results in an on-demand Jaynes-Cummings interaction with a high on-off ratio. We measure a longitudinal coupling rate an order of magnitude larger than all decay rates, placing the device in the strong coupling regime. The intrinsic longitudinal interaction demonstrated here will enable the development of high-connectivity quantum information processing hardware and the exploration of the gravitational decoherence of quantum objects.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence, rooted in the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, is a crucial quantum resource. Various measures, operational interpretations, and generalizations of quantum coherence have been proposed. In recent years, its role in quantum dynamics and technologies has attracted much attention. We introduce the concept of average quantum distance at a given time, and show that quantum coherence can be interpreted as the average evolution speed for arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonians. We extend the considerations to open quantum dynamics, where we find that quantum coherence can be used to bound the average evolution speed. Secondly, beyond this average setting, we show how quantum coherence and the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian together determine the instantaneous evolution speed in the general case, with the trade-off being the energy uncertainty. Finally, we use the strategy to analyze the charging and discharging in quantum batteries, demonstrating the potential of our method in quantum technologies. We believe that the results clarify the role quantum coherence in quantum dynamics, paving an alternate avenue, complementary to the existing ones, to understand the capacity of quantum resources in dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of spontaneous symmetry breaking with emergent multi-qubit entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is crucial to the occurrence of phase transitions. Once a phase transition occurs, a quantum system presents degenerate eigenstates that lack the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. After crossing the critical point, the system is essentially evolved to a quantum superposition of these eigenstates until decoherence sets in. Despite the fundamental importance and potential applications in quantum technologies, such quantum-mechanical SSB phenomena have not been experimentally explored in many-body systems. We here present an experimental demonstration of the SSB process in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, governed by the competition between the individual driving and intra-qubit interaction. The model is realized in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where 6 Xmon qubits are coupled in an all-to-all manner through virtual photon exchange mediated by a resonator. The observed nonclassical correlations among these qubits in the symmetry-breaking region go beyond the conventional description of SSB, shedding new light on phase transitions for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>1-milligram torsional pendulum for experiments at the quantum-gravity interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the possibility of entanglement generation through gravity offers a path to tackle the question of whether gravitational fields possess a quantum mechanical nature. A potential realization necessitates systems with low-frequency dynamics at an optimal mass scale, for which the microgram-to-milligram range is a strong contender. Here, after refining a figure-of-merit for the problem, we present a 1-milligram torsional pendulum operating at 18 Hz. We demonstrate laser cooling its motion from room temperature to 240~microkelvins, surpassing by over 20-fold the coldest motions attained for oscillators ranging from micrograms to kilograms. The cooling boosts the pendulum's feeble quantum coherence length, achieving the highest quantum-gravity figure-of-merit benchmarked for a table-top experiment, ranking second only to LIGO. The current approach shows a large improvement potential compared to many systems, positioning milligram-scale torsional pendulums as a prominent platform to pursue for exploring quantum aspects of gravity.</description>

      <title>Magic of the Heisenberg Picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-stabilizerness resource theory for operators, which is dual to that describing states. We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all R\'enyi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</description>

Abstract: Graph states are computationally powerful quantum states with many applications including use as resource states for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC). We demonstrate construction of graph states on a Rydberg atom quantum analogue simulator. We show how an always-on interaction can be used to simultaneously entangle all Rydberg atoms into a graph state. We construct and implement many-body computational order parameters for graph states using non-local measurement-based logic operations in the Clifford group. The order parameters measure the efficacy of entanglement to allow MBQC on graph states of any size. We parameterize finite-size scaling of these order parameters. Our results define a route to efficiently test computational power in quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and systematic numerical methods for robust control design are crucial in quantum systems due to inevitable uncertainties or disturbances. We propose a novel approach that models uncertainties as random variables and quantifies robustness using the expectation of infidelity by reformulating it as a weighted tensor product quadrature. We employ the Smolyak algorithm to develop a parametric robust quantum control scheme, which balances the reduction of computational cost with the enhancement of estimation accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm by incorporating the Smolyak sparse grids into conventional gradient-based quantum optimal control methods such as GRAPE and GOAT. In robust control problems concerning quantum gate realization, low infidelity and strong robustness can be achieved. These results contribute to improving the reliability and security of quantum computing and communication systems in the presence of real-world imperfections.</description>

Abstract: Quantum process tomography is a useful tool for characterizing quantum processes. This task is essential for the development of different areas, such as quantum information processing. In this work, we present a protocol for selective continuous-variable quantum process tomography. Our proposal allows one to selectively estimate any element of an unknown continuous-variable quantum process in the position representation, without requiring the complete reconstruction of the process. By resorting to controlled squeezing and translation operations, and adaptatively discretizing the process, a direct measure of an estimate of any process element can be obtained. Furthermore, we show, supported by numerical simulations, how the protocol can be used to partially reconstruct on a region a continuous-variable quantum process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the symmetry groups of regular tessellations on two-dimensional surfaces of different constant curvatures, including spheres, Euclidean planes and hyperbolic planes, to encode a qubit or qudit into the physical degrees of freedom on these surfaces, which we call tessellation codes. We show that tessellation codes exhibit decent error correction properties by analysis via geometric considerations and the representation theory of the isometry groups on the corresponding surfaces. Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations through geometric rotations of surfaces in real space, opening a new approach to logical quantum computation. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups.</description>

      <title>The complexity of entanglement embezzlement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement is the counterintuitive process in which entanglement is extracted from a resource system using local unitary operations, with almost no detectable change in the resource's state. It has recently been argued that any state of a relativistic quantum field theory can serve as a resource for perfect embezzlement. We study the circuit complexity of embezzlement, using sequences of states that enable arbitrary precision for the process, commonly called universal embezzling families. In addition, we argue that this approach provides a well-defined model for the complexity of embezzlement from quantum field theories. Under fairly general assumptions, we establish a generic lower bound on the complexity, which increases with the precision of the process or embezzled entanglement, and diverges as these become infinite. As an example, we consider a $1d$ critical system as the resource and derive an exponentially growing lower bound on the complexity. Consequently, the findings imply that circuit complexity acts as a physical obstruction to perfect embezzlement. Supplementary to the main results, we derive lower bounds for common models of circuit complexity for state preparation, based on the difference between the Schatten norms of the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and reconfigurable graph state generation with a single solid-state quantum emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing offers a promising route towards scalable, universal photonic quantum computation. This approach relies on the deterministic and efficient generation of photonic graph states in which many photons are mutually entangled with various topologies. Recently, deterministic sources of graph states have been demonstrated with quantum emitters in both the optical and microwave domains. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic and reconfigurable graph state generation with optical solid-state integrated quantum emitters. Specifically, we use a single semiconductor quantum dot in a cavity to generate caterpillar graph states, the most general type of graph state that can be produced with a single emitter. By using fast detuned optical pulses, we achieve full control over the spin state, enabling us to vary the entanglement topology at will. We perform quantum state tomography of two successive photons, measuring Bell state fidelities up to 0.80$\pm$0.04 and concurrences up to 0.69$\pm$0.09, while maintaining high photon indistinguishability. This simple optical scheme, compatible with commercially available quantum dot-based single photon sources, brings us a step closer to fault-tolerant quantum computing with spins and photons.</description>

      <title>Subgradient Method using Quantum Annealing for Inequality-Constrained Binary Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a generic solver for combinatorial optimization problems that utilizes quantum fluctuations. Recently, there has been extensive research applying quantum annealers, which are hardware implementations of quantum annealing. Since quantum annealers can only handle quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems using quantum annealers, the constraints must be incorporated into the objective function. One such technique is the Ohzeki method, which employs a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to relax equality constraints, and its effectiveness for large-scale problems has been demonstrated numerically. This study applies the Ohzeki method to combinatorial optimization problems with inequality constraints. We show that inequality constraints can be relaxed into a similar objective function through statistical mechanics calculations similar to those for equality constraints. In addition, we evaluate the performance of this method in a typical inequality-constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the quadratic knapsack problem.</description>

Abstract: We use operators from generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the inequality for indices of coincidence corresponding to few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restart is a common strategy observed in nature that accelerates first-passage processes and has been extensively studied using classical random walks. In the quantum regime, restart in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) has been shown to expedite the quantum hitting times. Here, we study how restarting monitored discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) affects the quantum hitting times. We show that the restarted DTQWs outperform classical random walks in target searches, benefiting from quantum ballistic propagation, a feature shared with their continuous-time counterparts. Moreover, the explicit coin degree of freedom in DTQWs allows them to surpass even CTQWs in target detection without sacrificing any quantum advantage. Additionally, knowledge of the target's parity or position relative to the origin can be leveraged to tailor DTQWs for even faster searches. Our study paves the way for more efficient use of DTQWs in quantum-walk-based search algorithms, simulations and modeling of quantum transport towards targeted sites in complex quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an essential resource for quantum science and technology. However, entanglement detection and quantification, via typical entanglement measures such as linear entanglement entropy or negativity, can be a very challenging task. Here we propose a protocol to detect bipartite entanglement in a system of $N$ qubits inspired by the concept of monogamy of entanglement, where, given a total system in a pure state with some bipartite entanglement between two subsystems, subsequent unitary evolution and measurement of one of the subsystems may be used to quantify the entanglement between the two. To address the difficulty of detection, we propose to use spin squeezing to quantify the entanglement within the individual subsystem. Knowing that the relation between spin squeezing and some entanglement measures is not one-to-one, we give some suggestions on how a judicious choice of squeezing Hamiltonian can lead to better results in our protocol. For systems with a small number of qubits, we derive analytical results and show how our protocol can work optimally for GHZ states. For larger systems, we show how the accuracy of the protocol can be improved by a proper choice of the squeezing Hamiltonian. Our protocol presents an alternative for entanglement detection in platforms where state tomography is inaccessible or hard to perform. Additionally, the ideas presented here can be extended beyond spin-only systems to expand their applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is an emergent field in which quantum dynamical systems are exploited for temporal information processing. In previous work, it was found a feature that makes a quantum reservoir valuable: contractive dynamics of the quantum reservoir channel toward input-dependent fixed points. These results are enhanced in this paper by finding conditions that guarantee a crucial aspect of the reservoir's design: distinguishing between different input sequences to ensure a faithful representation of temporal input data. This is implemented by finding a condition that guarantees injectivity in reservoir computing filters, with a special emphasis on the quantum case. We provide several examples and focus on a family of quantum reservoirs that is much used in the literature; it consists of an input-encoding quantum channel followed by a strictly contractive channel that enforces the echo state and the fading memory properties. This work contributes to analyzing valuable quantum reservoirs in terms of their input dependence.</description>

Abstract: We simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using the Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on a neutral atom quantum computer. We test the ground-state energy of spin systems with up to 15 spins. Two different encoding schemes are used: an individual spin encoding where each spin is represented by one qubit, and an efficient Gray code encoding scheme which only requires a number of qubits that scales with the logarithm of the number of spins. This more efficient encoding, together with zero noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.</description>

Abstract: In high-energy physics, coordinate noncommutativity represents the core idea that space itself can be quantized, as expressed through the frameworks of string theory and noncommutative field theory. Influence of such a noncommutativity on 2D quantum oscillatory motion, which undergoes parameter variations, is investigated. We first derive quantum solutions of the system described with time-independent parameters considering the noncommutativity of coordinates as a preliminary step. And then, we extend our study, framed with noncommutative phase-space formalism, to obtain relevant solutions of the system with time-dependent parameters. This system, which we focus on, is nonstationary due to variation of parameters in time. While the left and right circular annihilation and creation operators are utilized in the quantal management of the basic stationary system, the Schr\"odinger equation of the nonstationary system is solved using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation procedure. The outcome of our analysis is useful in understanding the effects of noncommutativity from quantum perspectives, especially in conjunction with the impact of parameter variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We can learn (more) about the state a quantum system is in through measurements. We look at how to describe the uncertainty about a quantum system's state conditional on executing such measurements. We show that by exploiting the interplay between desirability, coherence and indifference, a general rule for conditioning can be derived. We then apply this rule to conditioning on measurement outcomes, and show how it generalises to conditioning on a set of measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>The partition function in the quantum-to-classical transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical statistical mechanics, the partition function is defined in phase space. We extend this concept to quantum statistical mechanics using Bohmian trajectories. The quantum partition function in phase space captures the ensemble of positions and momenta, along with the probability distribution that accounts for the inherent uncertainty in measuring particle locations. Within this framework, the quantum-to-classical transition arises naturally, maintaining consistency between dynamics and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>A Multilevel Framework for Partitioning Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Executing quantum algorithms over distributed quantum systems requires quantum circuits to be divided into sub-circuits which communicate via entanglement-based teleportation. Naively mapping circuits to qubits over multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) results in large communication overhead, increasing both execution time and noise. This can be minimised by optimising the assignment of qubits to QPUs and the methods used for covering non-local operations. Formulations that are general enough to capture the spectrum of teleportation possibilities lead to complex problem instances which can be difficult to solve effectively. This highlights a need to exploit the wide range of heuristic techniques used in the graph partitioning literature. This paper formalises and extends existing constructions for graphical quantum circuit partitioning and designs a new objective function that captures further possibilities for non-local operations via nested state teleportation. We adapt the well-known Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic to the constraints and problem objective and explore multilevel techniques that coarsen hypergraphs and partition at multiple levels of granularity. We find that this reduces runtime and improves solution quality of standard partitioning. We place these techniques within a larger framework, through which we can extract full distributed quantum circuits including teleportation instructions. We compare the entanglement requirements and runtimes with state-of-the-art methods, finding that we can achieve the lowest entanglement costs in most cases, while always being close to the best performing method. We achieve an average improvement of 33% over the next best performing method across a wide range of circuits. We also find that our techniques can scale to much larger circuit sizes than state-of-the-art methods, provided the number of partitions is not too large.</description>

      <title>Relativity of Quantum Correlations: Invariant Quantities and Frame-Dependent Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewing frames of reference as physical systems, subject to the same laws as the systems they describe, is central to the relational approach in physics. Under the assumption that quantum mechanics universally governs all physical entities, this perspective naturally leads to the concept of quantum reference frames (QRFs). We investigate the perspective-dependence of position and momentum uncertainties, correlations, covariance matrices, and entanglement within the QRF formalism. We show that the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relations are frame-dependent, and so are correlations and variances, which satisfy various constraints described as inequalities. However, the determinant of the total covariance matrix, linked to the uncertainty volume in phase space, as well as variance-based entanglement criteria, remains invariant under changes of reference frame. Under specific conditions, the purities of subsystems are also invariant for different QRFs, but in general, they are perspective-dependent. These invariants suggest fundamental, robust measures of uncertainty and entanglement that persist despite changes in observational perspective, potentially inspiring dedicated quantum information protocols as well as further foundational studies.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Control using Reinforcement Learning from Demonstration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum control requires high-precision and robust control pulses to ensure optimal system performance. However, control sequences generated with a system model may suffer from model bias, leading to low fidelity. While model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been developed to avoid such biases, training an RL agent from scratch can be time-consuming, often taking hours to gather enough samples for convergence. This challenge has hindered the broad application of RL techniques to larger and more complex quantum control issues, limiting their adaptability. In this work, we use Reinforcement Learning from Demonstration (RLfD) to leverage the control sequences generated with system models and further optimize them with RL to avoid model bias. By avoiding learning from scratch and starting with reasonable control pulse shapes, this approach can increase sample efficiency by reducing the number of samples, which can significantly reduce the training time. Thus, this method can effectively handle pulse shapes that are discretized into more than 1000 pieces without compromising final fidelity. We have simulated the preparation of several high-fidelity non-classical states using the RLfD method. We also find that the training process is more stable when using RLfD. In addition, this method is suitable for fast gate calibration using reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum metrology using non-Hermitian spin model with RT-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian transverse $XY$ model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having $\mathcal{RT}$-symmetry, referred to as $iKSEA$ model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the $iKSEA$ model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with $N$ being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate. Moreover, we illustrate that starting from a product state, the non-Hermitian evolving Hamiltonian can create the dynamical state that surpasses the standard quantum limit in the broken regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional method for generating entangled states in qubit systems relies on applying precise two-qubit entangling gates alongside single-qubit rotations. However, achieving high-fidelity entanglement demands high accuracy in two-qubit operations, requiring complex calibration protocols. In this work, we use a minimally calibrated two-qubit iSwap-like gate, tuned via straightforward parameter optimization (flux pulse amplitude and duration), to prepare Bell states and GHZ states experimentally in systems of two and three transmon qubits. By integrating this gate into a variational quantum algorithm (VQA), we bypass the need for intricate calibration while maintaining high fidelity. Our proposed methodology employs variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to create the target quantum state through imperfect multiqubit operations. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for Bell states, confirming their high fidelity of preparation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum dynamics provides the arguably most fundamental example of hybrid dynamics: As long as no measurement takes place, the system state is governed by the Schr\"odinger-Liouville differential equation, which is however interrupted and replaced by projective dynamics at times when measurements take place. We show how this alternatingly continuous and projective evolution can be cast in form of one single differential equation for a refined state space manifold and thus be made amenable to standard port-theoretic analysis and control techniques.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>

Abstract: Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis. Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we discuss the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10893v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain symmetry aspects of non-interacting and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic charge and current densities in conical space with a circular edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.</description>

      <title>Typical Positivity of Nonequilibrium Entropy Production for Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that the nonequilibrium dynamics of most pure states gives rise to the same entropy production as that of the corresponding ensemble, provided the effective dimension of the ensemble is large enough. This establishes the positivity of entropy production under a wide variety of nonequilibrium situations. Our results follow from dynamical typicality and suitable continuity properties alone, without relying on non-integrability, and they complement other recent efforts to establish "pure state second laws". An explicit comparison with the distinctively different two-point measurement scheme is also provided.</description>

      <title>High precision spectroscopy of trilobite Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform three-photon photoassociation to obtain high resolution spectra of $^{87}$Rb trilobite dimers for the principal quantum numbers $n = 22,24,25,26$, and $27$. The large binding energy of the molecules in combination with a relative spectroscopic resolution of $10^{-4}$ provides a rigorous benchmark for existing theoretical models. A recently developed Green's function framework, which circumvents the convergence issues that afflicted previous studies,, is employed to theoretically reproduce the vibrational spectrum of the molecule with high accuracy. The relatively large molecular binding energy are primarily determined by the low energy $S$-wave electron-atom scattering length, thereby allowing us to extract the $^3S_1$ scattering phase shift with unprecedented accuracy, at low energy regimes inaccessible to free electrons.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Customized, Low-Loss Optical Resonators by Combination of FIB-Milling and CO$_2$ Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fabry-Perot cavities are essential tools for applications like precision metrology, optomechanics and quantum technologies. A major challenge is the creation of microscopic spherical mirror structures which allow the precise matching with the wavefront of a Gaussian beam, while providing high surface quality. We present a novel fabrication technique, enabling the creation of customized microscopic cavity mirror structures over a wide range of geometrical parameters, by combining focused ion beam milling (FIB) and CO$_2$ laser smoothing. While FIB milling allows us to imprint features on the mirror substrate with a resolution on the nanometer scale, the application of defocused CO$_2$ laser pulses consistently reduces remaining surface deformations down to a roughness of $\sigma_\text{RMS}=0.2\,$nm. The average deviation of the profile from a spherical shape is kept below a few nanometres. This technique enables the customized and repeatable fabrication of low loss optics on a wide range of optical substrates, including optical fibres. Thus, Fabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high finesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is created by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be used to create arbitrary structures with a resolution given by the FIB milling. At the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO$_2$ laser smoothing processes, without degrading the FIB milled shape.</description>

      <title>Conditioning and AGM-like belief change in the Desirability-Indifference framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the AGM framework for belief change (expansion, revision, contraction) can be extended to deal with conditioning in the so-called Desirability-Indifference framework, based on abstract notions of accepting and rejecting options, as well as on abstract notions of events. This level of abstraction allows us to deal simultaneously with classical and quantum probability theory.</description>

      <title>Vibrationally highly excited trilobite molecules stabilized by non-adiabatic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation of highly excited ($\nu \sim 100)$ vibrational states of a trilobite ultralong-range Rydberg molecule in $^{87}$Rb. These states manifest spectroscopically in a regularly spaced series of peaks red-detuned from the $25f_{7/2}$ dissociation threshold. The existence and observed stability of these states requires the almost complete suppression of the adiabatic decay pathway induced by the $P$-wave shape resonance of Rb. This stabilization is predicted to occur only for certain Rydberg levels where the avoided crossing between trilobite and $P$-wave dominated butterfly potential energy curves nearly vanishes, allowing the vibrational states to diabatically traverse the crossing with almost unit probability. This is the first direct measurement of beyond-Born-Oppenheimer physics in long-range Rydberg molecules, and paves the way for future experiments to access and manipulate wavepackets formed from high-lying vibrational states.</description>

      <title>Semantic Wave Functions: Exploring Meaning in Large Language Models Through Quantum Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode semantic relationships in high-dimensional vector embeddings. This paper explores the analogy between LLM embedding spaces and quantum mechanics, positing that LLMs operate within a quantized semantic space where words and phrases behave as quantum states. To capture nuanced semantic interference effects, we extend the standard real-valued embedding space to the complex domain, drawing parallels to the double-slit experiment. We introduce a "semantic wave function" to formalize this quantum-derived representation and utilize potential landscapes, such as the double-well potential, to model semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued similarity measure that incorporates both magnitude and phase information, enabling a more sensitive comparison of semantic representations. We develop a path integral formalism, based on a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a gauge field and Mexican hat potential, to model the dynamic evolution of LLM behavior. This interdisciplinary approach offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and potentially manipulating LLMs, with the goal of advancing both artificial and natural language understanding.</description>

      <title>Jeff = 1/2 Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: A Pathway toward New Spin Physics and Quantum Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization of light and matter in cavity-coupled Rydberg arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Shape Invariance: Numerical Bootstrap as a Detector of Solvable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We analytically show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.</description>
