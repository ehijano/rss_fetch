      <title>Search for new physics in final states with semi-visible jets or anomalous signatures using the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search is presented for hadronic signatures of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, with an emphasis on signatures of a strongly-coupled hidden dark sector accessed via resonant production of a $Z'$ mediator. The ATLAS experiment dataset collected at the Large Hadron Collider from 2015 to 2018 is used, consisting of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The $Z'$ mediator is considered to decay to two dark quarks, which each hadronize and decay to showers containing both dark and Standard Model particles, producing a topology of interacting and non-interacting particles within a jet known as ``semi-visible". Machine learning methods are used to select these dark showers and reject the dominant background of mismeasured multijet events, including an anomaly detection approach to preserve broad sensitivity to a variety of BSM topologies. A resonance search is performed by fitting the transverse mass spectrum based on a functional form background estimation. No significant excess over the expected background is observed. Results are presented as limits on the production cross section of semi-visible jet signals, parameterized by the fraction of invisible particles in the decay and the $Z'$ mass, and by quantifying the significance of any generic Gaussian-shaped mass peak in the anomaly region.</description>

      <title>Search for emerging jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV with the ATLAS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for emerging jets is presented using 51.8 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV, collected by the ATLAS experiment during 2022 and 2023. The search explores a hypothetical dark sector featuring 'dark quarks', which are charged under a confining gauge group and couple to the Standard Model via a new mediator particle. These dark quarks undergo showering and hadronization within the dark sector, forming long-lived dark mesons that decay back into Standard Model particles. This results in jets which contain multiple displaced vertices known as emerging jets. The analysis targets events with pairs of emerging jets, produced either through a vector mediator, $Z'$, in the $s$-channel, or a scalar mediator, $\Phi$, in the $t$-channel. No significant excess over the Standard Model background is observed. Assuming a dark pion proper decay length between 5 and 50 mm, $Z'$ mediator masses between 600 and 2550 GeV are excluded for quark and dark quark coupling values of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. For a quark-dark quark coupling of $0.1$, $\Phi$ mediator masses between 600 and 1375 GeV are excluded. These results provide the first direct constraints on emerging jet pair production via a $Z'$ mediator, and represent the first search to investigate emerging jet production via $t$-channel exchange of a scalar mediator.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Rare Kaon Decays at J-PARC with KOTO and KOTO II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare kaon decay $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$ is extremely sensitive to new physics, because the contribution to this decay in the Standard Model (SM) is highly suppressed and known very accurately; the branching ratio is $3\times 10^{-11}$ in the SM with a theoretical uncertainty of just 2%. The measurement of this branching ratio could provide essential new information about the flavor structure of the quark sector from the $s\to d$ transition. The decay is being searched for in the KOTO experiment at J-PARC, which has obtained the current best upper limit on the branching ratio of $2.2\times 10^{-9}$; a sensitivity to branching ratios below $10^{-10}$ is achievable by the end of the decade. A next-generation experiment at J-PARC, KOTO II, was proposed in 2024 with 82 members worldwide, including significant contributions from European members. The goal of KOTO II is to measure the $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$ branching ratio with sensitivity below $10^{-12}$ in the 2030s. Discovery of the decay with $5\sigma$ significance is achievable at the SM value of the branching ratio. An indication of new physics with a significance of 90% is possible if the observed branching ratio differs by 40% from the SM value. Another important goal of KOTO II is to measure the branching ratio of the unobserved $K_L\to \pi^0e^+e^-$ decay, which can give an input to flavor structures of new physics. Other rare $K_L$ decays and hidden-sector particles are also in the scope of the study. After 2026, KOTO will be the only dedicated rare kaon decay experiment in the world, and KOTO II is the only future rare kaon decay project currently proposed. We would like to lead a global initiative for the experimental study of rare kaon decays, with significant contributions and support from the European community.</description>

      <title>Probing the dimuon channel of a $Z^{\prime}$ boson at the HL-LHC using multivariate analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming upgrade of the existing LHC facility at CERN is known as the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). It is designed to extend its physics reach by substantially increasing the integrated luminosity. It will enable more precise measurements of the Standard Model (SM) and improve sensitivity to rare events and possible new physics signatures. This study adopts a multivariate analysis (MVA) approach to effectively discriminate the dark Higgs (DH) signal against the dominant SM background. The analysis targets the leptonic decay mode of the Z$^\prime$ boson, focusing on the dimuon final state at $\sqrt{s} = 14,\text{TeV}$ and $3000,\text{fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity corresponding to the HL-LHC. The DH signal is examined using the Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA), employing and comparing the performance of three classifiers: Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Likelihood estimators.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Search with ABRACADABRA-10\,cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ABRACADABRA-10 cm has had great success as a pathfinder lumped-element axion dark matter experiment, setting limits on axion dark matter at the GUT scale. Now, using the interaction of gravitational waves with electrodynamics and a change in readout strategy, we use the ABRA-10 cm detector for the first search for high-frequency gravitational waves using a modified axion detector. Potential sources at these high frequencies (10 kHz to 5 MHz) include merging primordial black hole binaries or superradiance, among other beyond the standard model phenomena. This paper presents the design, results, and challenges from the ABRA-10 cm high-frequency gravitational wave search, showing it is possible to simultaneously look for axions and high-frequency gravitational waves with both searches matching theoretical expectations for sensitivity. Additionally, we conducted the first time series transient search with data from an axion experiment, achieving sensitivity to $10^{-4}$ in strain. Scaled directly to the next generation axion experiment, DMRadio-GUT, this sensitivity would imply a reach to 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ primordial black hole mergers at distances around 3 pc, with prospects to go significantly further with modifications to the readout.</description>

      <title>Higher order flow coefficients -- A Messenger of QCD medium formed in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic flow and fluctuations are sensitive observables to the initial state effects in heavy ion collisions and are characterized by the medium properties and final state interactions. Using event-shape observables, one can constrain the probability distributions of anisotropic flow coefficients, thus reducing the linear and nonlinear contributions in the measured higher-order harmonics. In this paper, we use transverse spherocity as an event shape observable to study the flow coefficients and elliptic flow fluctuations. Transverse spherocity is found to have a strong correlation with elliptic flow and its fluctuations. We exploit this feature of transverse spherocity to remove the contribution of elliptic flow from higher-order harmonics. The study is performed in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using a multi-phase transport model. The multi-particle Q-cumulant method estimates the anisotropic flow coefficients, which reduces the non-flow contributions. We observe a stronger system response to the flow coefficients for the events with smaller values of elliptic flow.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities and the properties of charm degrees of freedom across the QCD crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized charm susceptibilities in 2+1 flavor QCD on the lattice at several lattice spacings. We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Higgs Production at Muon Colliders: The Role of One-Loop Effective Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $A$ at muon colliders within the framework of Type-II and Type-X Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) at the Next-to-Leading Order (NLO), utilizing an Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach. In particular, we analyze the level of enhancement to the cross section due to the inclusion of the one-loop corrections involving $\gamma$ and $Z$ boson fusion compared to the tree-level contribution. We find that for Type-II, including the effective vertices of $\gamma\gamma A$, $\gamma Z A$ and $ZZ A$, could lead to an enhancement of a factor of $\sim 2$ at low $m_A$ and low $\tan\beta$, whereas for Type-X, the enhancement could reach $\sim 10$ in the same regime. We also investigate the impact of the COM energy and $\tan \beta$ on the production cross section. We find that for the region of the parameter space not excluded by experiment, cross sections of $\gtrsim 1$ fb for Type-II, and $\gtrsim 5$ fb for Type-X, are possible, making the proposed muon collider a feasible alternative for probing the 2HDM extended Higgs sector.</description>

Abstract: In this paper BEPC, BEPCII and BEPCII-U have been briefly reviewed, which lay a good foundation of CEPC as a Higgs factory. BEPCII reached the designed luminos-ity goal of 10^33cm^-2s^-1 @1.89GeV on April 5, 2016. As an upgrade program of BEPCII, BEPCII-U has been com-pleted and started commissioning in March of 2025 with the luminosity goal as 3.7*10^32cm^-2s^-1 @2.8GeV. CEPC as Higgs factory has been reviewed on Engineering De-sign Report (EDR) status and plan for construction proposal to Chinese government in 2025.</description>

      <title>Rephasing invariants of CP violation for heavy and light Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the canonical seesaw mechanism, the strengths of charged-current interactions for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos are described respectively by the $3\times 3$ matrices $U$ and $R$ that are correlated with each other via the exact seesaw relation and the unitarity condition. We write out the Majorana-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$, which are insensitive to redefining the phases of three charged-lepton fields; and the Dirac-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$ that are insensitive to the rephasing of both the charged-lepton fields and the neutrino fields. Such invariants are explicitly calculated with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure containing nine active-sterile flavor mixing angles and six independent CP-violating phases, and their corresponding roles in the CP-violating asymmetries of three heavy Majorana neutrino decays and in the flavor oscillations of three light Majorana neutrinos are briefly discussed. We point out that similar rephasing invariants arising from the interplay between $R$ and $U$ may also manifest themselves in a variety of lepton-flavor-violating and lepton-number-violating processes.</description>

      <title>Neutrino magnetic moments: effective versus fundamental parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for neutrino magnetic moments offers a valuable window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, a common misconception arises in the interpretation of experimental results: the assumption that the so-called effective neutrino magnetic moment is a universal, experiment-independent quantity. In reality, this effective parameter depends on the specific characteristics of each experiment, including the neutrino source, flavor composition or energy spectrum. As a result, the effective magnetic moment derived from solar neutrino data differs fundamentally from that obtained in reactor or accelerator-based experiments. Treating these quantities as directly comparable can lead to misleading conclusions. In this work, we clarify the proper definition of the effective neutrino magnetic moment in various experimental contexts and discuss the implications of this misconception for global analyses and theoretical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Transverse single-spin asymmetries in $\gamma$SIDIS as a direct probe of quark-gluon-quark longitudinal momentum structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transverse single-spin asymmetries in the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic production of isolated photons ($\gamma$SIDIS), $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$, provide an unprecedented opportunity to extract the quark-gluon-quark correlators $F_{FT}(x,x')$ and $G_{FT}(x,x')$ point-by-point in their full support $x,x'$. We utilize realistic models for these functions, based on input from the Sivers transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function and imposing constraints from the $d_2$ matrix element calculated in lattice QCD, in order to provide numerical estimates for $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We thoroughly explore the EIC phase space in order to isolate in which regions the asymmetry can be sizable, finding it can be as much as $10\%$ or larger for certain kinematics. Given that $F_{FT}(x,x')$ and $G_{FT}(x,x')$ are basically unknown, $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$ will be an important future measurement to learn about multi-parton correlations in the nucleon.</description>

Abstract: We predict the existence of two novel bottomoniumlike states, $Y(10600)$ and $Y(10650)$, as either the $P$-wave $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ bound state or resonance close to the $B\bar{B}^{*}$ and $B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ thresholds, respectively, which are dynamically generated in a coupled-channel framework and have quantum numbers $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{--})$. The first one $Y(10600)$ is identified as the hidden-bottom partner of the recently established charmoniumlike state $G(3900)$, the first candidate of P-wave dimeson resonance in the heavy flavor sector associated with the $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ scattering dynamics. We predict the line shapes of both $Y(10600)$ and $Y(10650)$ in the cross sections of open bottom processes $e^+e^- \to B\bar{B}^*$ and $e^+e^- \to B^*\bar{B}^*$, both of which exhibit a pronounced peak line shape, and we find that existing experimental data from BelleII show obvious indications of $Y(10650)$. These two new states closely mirror the behavior of $G(3900)$, as their predicted masses lie between the well-known $\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\Upsilon(5S)$, suggesting a manifestly exotic nature once they can be observed by the experiment. Therefore, the experimental search for these new bottomoniumlike states would provide critical evidence for a new class of exotic hadrons of the $P$-wave dimeson and would offer decisive insight into the $XYZ$ spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Evidence of off-shell Higgs boson production from $ZZ$ leptonic decay channels and constraints on its total width with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter reports on a search for off-shell production of the Higgs boson using 139 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The signature is a pair of $Z$ bosons, with contributions from both the production and subsequent decay of a virtual Higgs boson and the interference of that process with other processes. The two observable final states are $ZZ\rightarrow 4\ell$ and $ZZ\rightarrow 2\ell2\nu$ with $\ell = e$ or $\mu$. In the $ZZ\rightarrow 4\ell$ final state, a dense Neural Network is used to enhance analysis sensitivity with respect to matrix element-based discrimination. The background-only hypothesis is rejected with an observed (expected) significance of 3.3 (2.2) standard deviations, representing experimental evidence for off-shell Higgs boson production. Assuming that no new particles enter the production of the virtual Higgs boson, its total width can be deduced from the measurement of its off-shell production cross-section. The measured total width of the Higgs boson is $4.4^{+3.0}_{-2.2}$ MeV, and the observed (expected) upper limit on the total width is found to be 10.1 (10.8) MeV at 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments, gains acceleration on GPUs and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs with jumbo-charge outputs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the long-serving method of waveform integration.</description>

Abstract: We report the results of a QCD axion dark matter search with discovery ability for Dine Fischler Srednicki Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axions using an axion haloscope. Sub-Kelvin noise temperatures are reached with an ultra low-noise Josephson parametric amplifier cooled by a dilution refrigerator. This work excludes (with a 90% confidence level) DFSZ axions with masses between 3.27 to 3.34 $\mu$eV, assuming a standard halo model with a local energy density of 0.45 GeV/cm$^3$ made up 100% of axions.</description>

      <title>Performance and radiation damage mitigation strategy for silicon photomultipliers on LEO space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space missions require lightweight, low-power consuming, radiation-tolerant components. Silicon photomultipliers are increasingly used for detecting near-UV, optical, and infrared light in space due to their compact design, low cost, low power consumption, robustness, and high photo-detection efficiency, which makes them sensitive to single photons. Although SiPMs outperform traditional photomultiplier tubes in many areas, concerns about their radiation tolerance and noise remain. In this study, we estimate the radiation effects on a satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550~km during the declining phase of solar cycle 25 (2026-2029). We evaluated silicon photomultipliers produced by the Foundation Bruno Kessler (FBK) using front-side illuminated technology with metal trenches (NUV-HD-MT), assessing their response to a 50~MeV proton beam and exposure to a $\beta$-radioactive source (strontium-90). Simulations with SPENVIS and Geant4 were used to validate the experimental results. Based on our findings, we propose a photosensor annealing strategy for space-based instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primary cosmic rays when interact with our atmosphere, produce a cascade of lighter secondary particles namely pion, kaon, neutrons, muons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. Muons are one of the most abundant and easily detectable particles at the ground surface using a large variety of particle detectors. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of 2m x 2m in dimension were developed to be used in large scale as the active detector elements in the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) which was planned to be built by the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). As a spin-off of this work, a portable stack of eight, one square foot RPC detectors is developed named as Cosmic Muon Tracker (CMT). It could be used to conduct small-scale particle detector experiments as well as training Students. We will discuss design, integration, characterisation and some of the applications of this detector in this paper.</description>

      <title>Search for the jet-induced diffusion wake in the quark-gluon plasma via measurements of jet-track correlations in photon-jet events in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a measurement of jet-track correlations in photon-jet events, using 1.72 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb data at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events with energetic photon-jet pairs are selected, where the photon and jet are approximately back-to-back in azimuth. The angular correlation between jets and charged-particle tracks with transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$) in the range 0.5-2.0 GeV in the hemisphere opposite to the jet, $|\Delta\phi\text{(jet,track)}|&gt;\pi/2$, is measured as a function of their relative pseudorapidity difference, $|\Delta\eta\text{(jet,track)}|$. In central Pb+Pb collisions, these correlations are predicted to be sensitive to the diffusion wake in the quark-gluon plasma resulting from the lost energy of high-$p_\text{T}$ partons traversing the plasma, with a characteristic modification as a function of $|\Delta\eta\text{(jet,track)}|$. The correlations are examined with different selections on the jet-to-photon $p_\text{T}$ ratio to select events with different degrees of energy loss. No diffusion wake signal is observed within the current sensitivity and upper limits at 95% confidence level on the diffusion wake amplitude are reported.</description>

      <title>AI-based particle track identification in scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of high-lying states within the charmonium family remains incomplete, particularly in light of recent observations of charmonium states at energies around 4 GeV. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of several high-lying charmonia, focusing on the $2D$ and $1F$ states. A mass spectrum analysis is conducted, incorporating the unquenched effects. We then present a detailed study of the strong decay properties, including partial decay widths for two-body strong decays permitted by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule. Additionally, we explore the primary radiative decay channels associated with these states. Finally, we discuss the productions of the $2D$ and $1F$ states via $B$-meson decay and $e^+e^-$ annihilation Theoretical predictions provided here aim to guide future experimental searches for high-lying charmonium states, particularly at BESIII, Belle II, LHCb and future facility STCF.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz invariance from the event KM3-230213A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is the cornerstone of relativity theory. Its implications have been verified experimentally with a variety of approaches. The detection of a muon at extremely high energy detected by the ARCA detector in the Mediterranean sea, the most energetic particle directly measured up to date, allows to put additional constraints on Lorentz non-invariant theories. The prediction of some of those theories is that the lifetimes of particles in the laboratory frame 'decrease' rather than 'increase' with increasing $\gamma$. In this frame the sheer fact that the muon traversed the whole ARCA detector puts a lower limit on the muon lifetime in the laboratory frame, that implies upper limits on Lorentz violating parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay provides an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Future neutrino experiments will improve the sensitivity to BNV nucleon decays and can serve to search for dark particles. In this work, we study the sterile neutrino effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light sterile neutrino on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-6 and dimension-7 EFT operator bases with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ or $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$. They are then matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian at low energies and the BNV interactions between the sterile neutrino and baryons and mesons. The rates of nucleon decay to SM neutrinos or a sterile neutrino are calculated. We then show the constraints on the ultraviolet scale from nucleon decay search at Super-K. The correlation of two EFT operators and the dependence on the sterile neutrino mass are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-monoenergetic Deuteron Acceleration via Boosted Coulomb Explosion by Reflected Picosecond Laser Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generation of quasi-monoenergetic ions by intense laser is one of long-standing goals in laser-plasma physics. However, existing laser-driven ion acceleration schemes often produce broad energy spectra and limited control over ion species. Here we propose the acceleration mechanism, boosted Coulomb explosion, initiated by a standing wave, which is formed in a pre-expanded plasma by the interference between a continuously incoming main laser pulse and the pulse reflected by a solid target, where the pre-expanded plasma is formed from a thin layer on the solid target by a relatively strong pre-pulse. This mechanism produces a persistent Coulomb field on the target front side with field strengths on the order of TV/m for picoseconds. We experimentally demonstrate generation of quasi-monoenergetic deuterons up to 50 MeV using an in-situ D$_2$O-deposited target. Our results show that the peak energy can be tuned by the laser pulse duration.</description>
