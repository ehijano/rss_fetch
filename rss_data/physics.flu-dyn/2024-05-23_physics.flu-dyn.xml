      <title>Adaptive coupling of 3D and 2D fluid flow models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to the notion of h-adaptivity, where the discretization resolution is adaptively changed, I propose the notion of model adaptivity, where the underlying model (the governing equations) is adaptively changed in space and time. Specifically, this work introduces a hybrid and adaptive coupling of a 3D bulk fluid flow model with a 2D thin film flow model. As a result, this work extends the applicability of existing thin film flow models to complex scenarios where, for example, bulk flow develops into thin films after striking a surface. At each location in space and time, the proposed framework automatically decides whether a 3D model or a 2D model must be applied. Using a meshless approach for both 3D and 2D models, at each particle, the decision to apply a 2D or 3D model is based on the user-prescribed resolution and a local principal component analysis. When a particle needs to be changed from a 3D model to 2D, or vice versa, the discretization is changed, and all relevant data mapping is done on-the-fly. Appropriate two-way coupling conditions and mass conservation considerations between the 3D and 2D models are also developed. Numerical results show that this model adaptive framework shows higher flexibility and compares well against finely resolved 3D simulations. In an actual application scenario, a 3 factor speed up is obtained, while maintaining the accuracy of the solution.</description>

      <title>Deep operator learning-based surrogate models for aerothermodynamic analysis of AEDC hypersonic waverider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are universal approximators that traditionally have been used to learn a map between function inputs and outputs. However, recent research has demonstrated that deep neural networks can be used to approximate operators, learning function-to-function mappings. Creating surrogate models to supplement computationally expensive hypersonic aerothermodynamic models in characterizing the response of flow fields at different angles of attack (AoA) is an ideal application of neural operators. We investigate the use of neural operators to infer flow fields (volume and surface quantities) around a geometry based on a 3D waverider model based on experimental data measured at the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel Number 9. We use a DeepONet neural operator which consists of two neural networks, commonly called a branch and a trunk network. The final output is the inner product of the output of the branch network and the output of the trunk net. Because the flow field contains shocks across the entire volume, we conduct a two-step training approach of the DeepONet that facilitates accurate approximation of solutions even in the presence of discontinuities. We train various DeepONet models to understand and predict pressure $(p)$, density $(\rho)$, velocity $(u)$, heat flux $(Q_w)$, and total shear stress $(\tau_{w})$ for the AEDC waverider geometry at Ma=7.36 across AoA that range from $-10^{\circ}$ to $10^{\circ}$ for surface quantities and from $-14^{\circ}$ to $14^{\circ}$ for volume quantities.</description>

      <title>Deformation and breakup of the liquid ligament with various disturbances on the interface in shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study performed a numerical analysis of the deformation and breakup of a liquid ligament with various disturbances on the interface in shear flow. The shear flow generates a three-dimensional flow and vortices around the liquid ligament. These vortices promote the movement of the liquid inside the liquid ligament. When the velocity difference of shear flow increases, a nonlinear effect becomes strong, and turbulence with higher wavenumber components than the initial disturbance occurs at the interface. This turbulence accelerates the ligament splitting and increases the number of breakup droplets. Then, the droplet diameters become uniform, and the atomization quality improves. As the wavenumber of the disturbance applied to the interface increases, the liquid moving velocity along the central axis of the liquid ligament increases. As the wavenumber increases, the breakup time of the liquid ligament becomes short. In addition to the initial reference disturbance with a low wavenumber, when turbulence with twice the wavenumber of the reference disturbance is applied to the interface, the interface deformation and the splitting of the liquid ligament are similar to those with the single reference disturbance. When turbulence with four times the wavenumber is added to the initial disturbance with the low wavenumber at the interface, the deformation of the liquid ligament is accelerated, and the liquid ligament splits faster. In addition, the total surface area of the liquid increases because the number of breakup droplets increases. The droplet diameter becomes uniform, and therefore, the atomization quality of the liquid ligament is improved.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity topology optimization of flow boiling heat transfer in microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a powerful method to design innovative structures with improved heat transfer performance. In the present study, a multi-fidelity TO method with a delicately defined objective function is developed for flow boiling heat transfer in microchannels. Low-fidelity TO is conducted for the reduced-order process of single-phase laminar convective heat transfer, which generates a set of structure candidates for subsequent high-fidelity evaluation of flow boiling heat transfer. To avoid the possible iteration between the low-fidelity TO and high-fidelity evaluation which leads to inefficient solution of the multi-fidelity TO, distributions of velocity, temperature and two-phase in microchannels with single-phase and/or flow boiling heat transfer are investigated and compared in detail, based on which a new objective function is delicately defined, which can be employed in the low-fidelity TO yet can stand for the performance of the high-fidelity problem. With the help of the new objective function, the efficiency of the multi-fidelity TO is significantly improved and TO structures are designed with hot spots eliminated, thermal resistance reduced and temperature uniformity improved. The present work provides a new method for TO of complicated heat and mass transfer problems. Keywords: topology optimization, flow boiling, multi-fidelity optimization, microchannels, convective heat transfer</description>

      <title>Optimal transient growth and transition to turbulence in the MHD pipe flow subject to a transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the influence of a transverse magnetic field on the transient growth of perturbations in a liquid-metal circular pipe flow with an electrically insulating or conducting wall. In this configuration, the mean flow profile and the amplification of perturbations are strongly affected by the applied magnetic field, leading to a rich dynamical landscape depending on its intensity. The analysis is performed for Reynolds numbers 5000 and 10 000, close to the transitional regime for moderate values of the Hartmann number, a non-dimensional parameter proportional to the applied magnetic field's intensity. Aside from a slight modification of hydrodynamic optimal perturbations at very small Hartmann numbers, we observe three other characteristic topologies of optimal perturbations depending on the intensity of the magnetic field. Their growth mechanisms differ, with the lift-up effect dominating at low Hartmann numbers and the Orr-mechanism becoming increasingly important as the magnetic field intensity is increased. In particular, we show in the intermediate regime of Hartmann numbers how transient growth occurs in two stages, with initial growth through the lift-up effect followed by a further increase of energy through the Orr-mechanism. We also conduct three-dimensional nonlinear simulations to track the time evolution of optimal perturbations, illustrating their nonlinear growth and eventual breakdown to a sustained turbulent state or the return of the system to a laminar state.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks-based Random Vortex Methods for Modelling Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel Neural Networks-based approach for approximating solutions to the (2D) incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. Our algorithm uses a Physics-informed Neural Network, that approximates the vorticity based on a loss function that uses a computationally efficient formulation of the Random Vortex dynamics. The neural vorticity estimator is then combined with traditional numerical PDE-solvers for the Poisson equation to compute the velocity field. The main advantage of our method compared to standard Physics-informed Neural Networks is that it strictly enforces physical properties, such as incompressibility or boundary conditions, which might otherwise be hard to guarantee with purely Neural Networks-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Flow and Heat Transfer in a Rotating Disc Cavity With Axial Throughflow at High Speed Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow and heat transfer in a compressor rotating disc cavity with axial throughflow is investigated using wall-modelled large-eddy simulations (WMLES). These are compared to measurements from recently published experiments and used to investigate high Reynolds number effects. The simulations use an open-source CFD solver with high parallel efficiency and employ the Boussinesq approximation for centrifugal buoyancy. Kinetic energy effects (characterised by Eckert number) are accounted for by scaling the thermal boundary conditions from static temperature to rotary stagnation temperature. The WMLES shows very encouraging agreement with experiments up to the highest Reynolds number tested, $Re_\phi=3.0\times10^6$. A further simulation at $Re_\phi=10^7$ extends the investigation to an operating condition more representative of aero engine high pressure compressors. The results support the scaling of shroud heat transfer found at lower $Re_\phi$, but disc heat transfer is higher than expected from a simple extrapolation of lower $Re_\phi$ results. This is associated with transition to turbulence in the disc Ekman layers and is consistent with the boundary layer Reynolds numbers at this condition. The introduction of swirl in the axial throughflow, as may occur at engine conditions, could reduce the boundary layer Reynolds numbers and delay the transition.</description>

      <title>Compressible turbulent convection: The role of temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of variable material properties, such as temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and dynamical viscosity, on the dynamics of a fully compressible turbulent convection flow beyond the anelastic limit are studied in the present work by two series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations in a layer of aspect ratio 4 with periodic boundary conditions in both horizontal directions. One simulation series is for a weakly stratified adiabatic background, one for a strongly stratified one. The Rayleigh number is $10^5$ and the Prandtl number is 0.7 throughout this study. The temperature dependence of material parameters is imposed as a power law with an exponent $\beta$. It generates a superadiabaticity $\varepsilon(z)$ that varies across the convection layer. Central statistical quantities of the flow, such as the mean superadiabatic temperature, temperature and density fluctuations, or turbulent Mach numbers are compared in the form of horizontal plane-time averaged profiles. It is found that the additional material parameter dependence causes systematic quantitative changes of all these quantities, but no qualitative ones. A growing temperature power law exponent $\beta$ also enhances the turbulent momentum transfer in the weak stratification case by 40\%, it reduces the turbulent heat transfer by up to 50\% in the strong stratification case.</description>

      <title>Local precursors to anomalous dissipation in Navier-Stokes turbulence: Burgers vortex-type models and simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous dissipation is a dissipation mechanism of kinetic energy which is established by a sufficiently spatially rough velocity field. It implies that the rescaled mean kinetic energy dissipation rate becomes constant with respect to Reynolds number ${\rm Re}$, the dimensionless parameter that characterizes the strength of turbulence, given that ${\rm Re}\gg 1$. The present study aims at bridging this statistical behavior of high-Reynolds-number turbulence to specific structural building blocks of fluid turbulence -- local vortex stretching configurations which take in the simplest case the form of Burgers' classical vortex stretching model from 1948. We discuss the anomalous dissipation in the framework of Duchon and Robert for this analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, apply the same analysis subsequently to a generalized model of randomly oriented Burgers vortices by Kambe and Hatakeyama, and analyse finally direct numerical simulation data of three-dimensional homogeneous, isotropic box turbulence in this respect. We identify local high-vorticity events in fully developed Navier-Stokes turbulence that approximate the analytical models of strong vortex stretching well. They also correspond to precursors of enhanced anomalous dissipation.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of fluid front dynamics driven by porous media pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-permeable porous media hosts air within their pores. Upon removal from the material's interior, these porous media have the tendency to replenish the air, effectively acting as a suction pump. Therefore, the technique used to convert a porous media into a pump, consists of degassing the material to remove their air inside. The suction property when recovering the air, can be used to move a liquid through a microfluidic channel, studying the dynamics of the liquid-air front. In this article, we have developed a theoretical mathematical model that precisely characterize the behavior of this kind of pumps and the dynamics of the liquid-air front. This model allows us to use porous media pumps as very accurate devices to move liquids in a completely controlled way, being able to obtain characteristic properties of fluids such as viscosity or the pressure applied to them. We have tested it using experimental data from the literature, and we have been able to observe that the theory fits satisfactorily with the experiments, being able to affirm that the model is correctly satisfied. This type of pump is of great interest to the scientific community because of its small size and the fact that it operates without any external power source.</description>

      <title>Utilizing indicator functions with computational data to confirm nature of overlap in normal turbulent stresses: logarithmic or quarter-power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indicator functions of the streamwise normal-stress profiles (NSP), based on careful differentiation of some of the best direct numerical simulations (DNS) data from channel and pipe flows, over the range $550&lt;Re_\tau&lt;16,000$, are examined to establish the existence and range in wall distances of either a logarithmic-trend segment or a $1/4$-power region. For the nine out of fifteen cases of DNS data we examined where $Re_\tau&lt;2,000$, the NSP did not contain either of the proposed trends. As $Re_\tau$ exceeds around $2,000$ a $1/4$-power, reflecting the ``bounded-dissipation'' predictions of Chen \&amp; Sreenivasan and data analysis of Monkewitz , develops near $y^+=1,000$ and expands with Reynolds numbers extending to $1,000&lt;y^+&lt;10,000$ for $Re_\tau$ around $15,000$. This range of $1/4$-power NSP corresponds to a range of outer-scaled $Y$ between around $0.3$ and $0.7$. The computational database examined did not include the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer experiments at higher Reynolds numbers where the logarithmic trend in the NSP has been previously reported around $y^+$ of $1,000$ by Marusic et al. according to a ``wall-scaled eddy model''.</description>

      <title>Space-time statistics of 2D soliton gas in shallow water studied by stereoscopic surface mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe laboratory experiments in a 2D wave tank that aim at building up and monitor 2D shallow water soliton gas. The water surface elevation is obtained over a large ($\sim 100\,\text{m}^2$) domain, with centimetre-resolution, by stereoscopic vision using two cameras. Floating particles are seeded to get surface texture and determine the wave field by image correlation. With this set-up, soliton propagation and multiple interactions can be measured with a previously unreachable level of detail. The propagation of an oblique soliton is analysed, the amplitude decay and local incidence are compared to analytical predictions. We further present two cases of 2D soliton gas, emerging from multiple line solitons with random incidence ($|\theta|&lt;30^\circ$) and from irregular random waves forced with a {\sc jonswap} spectrum ($|\theta|&lt;45^\circ$). To our knowledge, those are the first observations of random 2D soliton gas for gravity waves. In both cases Mach reflections and Mach expansions result in solitons that mainly propagate in directions perpendicular to the wave-makers.</description>

      <title>An all Mach number semi-implicit hybrid Finite Volume/Virtual Element method for compressible viscous flows on Voronoi meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel high order semi-implicit hybrid finite volume/virtual element numerical scheme for the solution of compressible flows on Voronoi tessellations. The method relies on the flux splitting of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations into three sub-systems: a convective sub-system solved explicitly using a finite volume (FV) scheme, and the viscous and pressure sub-systems which are discretized implicitly at the aid of a virtual element method (VEM). Consequently, the time step restriction of the overall algorithm depends only on the mean flow velocity and not on the fast pressure waves nor on the viscous eigenvalues. As such, the proposed methodology is well suited for the solution of low Mach number flows at all Reynolds numbers. Moreover, the scheme is proven to be globally energy conserving so that shock capturing properties are retrieved in high Mach number flows. To reach high order of accuracy in time and space, an IMEX Runge-Kutta time stepping strategy is employed together with high order spatial reconstructions in terms of CWENO polynomials and virtual element space basis functions. The chosen discretization techniques allow the use of general polygonal grids, a useful tool when dealing with complex domain configurations. The new scheme is carefully validated in both the incompressible limit and the high Mach number regime through a large set of classical benchmarks for fluid dynamics, assessing robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing lattice kinetic schemes for fluid dynamics with Lattice-Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of equivariant neural networks, hereby dubbed Lattice-Equivariant Neural Networks (LENNs), designed to satisfy local symmetries of a lattice structure. Our approach develops within a recently introduced framework aimed at learning neural network-based surrogate models Lattice Boltzmann collision operators. Whenever neural networks are employed to model physical systems, respecting symmetries and equivariance properties has been shown to be key for accuracy, numerical stability, and performance.
  Here, hinging on ideas from group representation theory, we define trainable layers whose algebraic structure is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the lattice cell. Our method naturally allows for efficient implementations, both in terms of memory usage and computational costs, supporting scalable training/testing for lattices in two spatial dimensions and higher, as the size of symmetry group grows. We validate and test our approach considering 2D and 3D flowing dynamics, both in laminar and turbulent regimes. We compare with group averaged-based symmetric networks and with plain, non-symmetric, networks, showing how our approach unlocks the (a-posteriori) accuracy and training stability of the former models, and the train/inference speed of the latter networks (LENNs are about one order of magnitude faster than group-averaged networks in 3D). Our work opens towards practical utilization of machine learning-augmented Lattice Boltzmann CFD in real-world simulations.</description>

Abstract: Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multi-component microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed, Deep Double Reservoir Network for Forecasting Boundary Layer Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a fluid flows over a solid surface, it creates a thin boundary layer where the flow velocity is influenced by the surface through viscosity, and can transition from laminar to turbulent at sufficiently high speeds. Understanding and forecasting the fluid dynamics under these conditions is one of the most challenging scientific problems in fluid dynamics. It is therefore of high interest to formulate models able to capture the nonlinear spatio-temporal velocity structure as well as produce forecasts in a computationally efficient manner. Traditional statistical approaches are limited in their ability to produce timely forecasts of complex, nonlinear spatio-temporal structures which are at the same time able to incorporate the underlying flow physics. In this work, we propose a model to accurately forecast boundary layer velocities with a deep double reservoir computing network which is capable of capturing the complex, nonlinear dynamics of the boundary layer while at the same time incorporating physical constraints via a penalty obtained by a Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Simulation studies on a one-dimensional viscous fluid demonstrate how the proposed model is able to produce accurate forecasts while simultaneously accounting for energy loss. The application focuses on boundary layer data on a water tunnel with a PDE penalty derived from an appropriate simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations, showing forecasts improved by 33.7% and 80.0% in terms of mass conservation and variability of velocity fluctuation, respectfully, against non physics-informed methods.</description>

      <title>Response of Non-premixed Jet Flames to Blast Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work investigates the response dynamics of non-premixed jet flame to blast waves that are incident along the jet axis. In the present study, blast waves, generated using the wire-explosion technique, are forced to sweep across a non-premixed jet flame that is stabilised over a nozzle rim positioned at a distance of 264 mm from the source of blast generation. The work spans a wide range of fuel jet Reynolds numbers ($Re$) and incident blast wave Mach numbers ($M_{s,r}$). The interaction imposes a characteristic flow field over the jet flame, marked by a sharp discontinuity followed by a decaying profile and a delayed second spike. The second spike in the flow field profile corresponds to the induced flow that follows the blast front. While the response of the flame to the blast front was minimal, it was found to detach from the nozzle rim and lift off following the interaction with the induced flow. Subsequently, the lifted flame was found to re-attach back at the nozzle or extinguish, contingent on the operating $Re$ and $M_{s,r}$. Alongside flame lift-off, flame tip flickering was aggravated under the influence of the induced flow. A simplified theoretical model extending the vorticity transport equation was developed to estimate the change in flickering timescales and length scales owing to the interaction with the induced flow. The observed experimental trends were further compared against theoretical predictions from the model.</description>

      <title>Mixed Convection From an Isothermal Rough Plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there are studies of mixed convection heat transfer from a smooth plate, studies of this phenomenon from an external rough plate are absent.
  The derivation by Jaffer (2023) of the heat transfer formula for natural convection from an external plate implies a simple relation between heat transfer and fluid velocity. This relation leads to formulas for mixed convection from horizontal and vertical rough plates; these formulas are then combined to predict the mixed convection heat transfer at any plate inclination.
  Heat transfer measurements of a 30.5 cm square rough plate with forced air velocities between 0.1 m/s and 2.5 m/s were made in each orthogonal combination of plate and airflow direction, and of a tilted downward-facing plate. Each data-set matches the present theory with root-mean-squared relative error between 1.4% and 4%.</description>

      <title>Extreme statistics and extreme events in dynamical models of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the intermittent properties of a shell model of turbulence with unprecedented statistics, about $\sim 10^7$ eddy turn over time, achieved thanks to an implementation on a large-scale parallel GPU factory. This allows us to quantify the inertial range anomalous scaling properties of the velocity fluctuations up to the 24th order moment. Through a careful assessment of the statistical and systematic uncertainties, we show that none of the phenomenological and theoretical models previously proposed in the literature to predict the anomalous power-law exponents in the inertial range is in agreement with our high-precision numerical measurements. We find that at asymptotically high order moments, the anomalous exponents tend towards a linear scaling, suggesting that extreme turbulent events are dominated by one leading singularity. We found that systematic corrections to scaling induced by the infrared and ultraviolet (viscous) cut-offs are the main limitations to precision for low-order moments, while high orders are mainly affected by the finite statistical samples. The unprecedentedly high fidelity numerical results reported in this work offer an ideal benchmark for the development of future theoretical models of intermittency in dynamical systems for either extreme events (high-order moments) or typical fluctuations (low-order moments). For the latter, we show that we achieve a precision in the determination of the inertial range scaling exponents of the order of one part over ten thousand (5th significant digit), which must be considered a record for out-of-equilibrium fluid-mechanics systems and models.</description>

      <title>Droplet dynamics in homogeneous isotropic turbulence with the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulating the dynamics of a droplet immersed in a generic time-dependent velocity gradient field. This approach is grounded on the hybrid coupling between the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, employed for the flow simulation, and the immersed boundary (IB) method, utilized to couple the droplet with the surrounding fluid. We show how to enrich the numerical scheme with a mesh regularization technique, allowing droplets to sustain large deformations. The resulting methodology is adapted to simulate the dynamics of droplets in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, with the characteristic size of the droplet being smaller than the characteristic Kolmogorov scale of the outer turbulent flow. We report on statistical results for droplet deformation and orientation, collected from an ensemble of turbulent trajectories, as well as comparisons with theoretical models in the limit of small deformation.</description>

      <title>On the relevance of lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows with small inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In particle-laden turbulent wall flows, lift forces can influence the near-wall turbulence. This has been recently observed in particle-resolved simulations, which, however, are too expensive to be used in upscaled models. Instead, point-particle simulations have been the method of choice to simulate the dynamics of these flows during the last decades. While this approach is simpler, cheaper, and physically sound for small inertial particles in turbulence, some issues remain. In the present work, we address challenges associated with lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows and the impact of lift forces in the near-wall flow. We performed direct numerical simulations (DNS) of small inertial point particles in turbulent channel flow for fixed Stokes number and mass loading while varying the particle size. Our results show that the particle dynamics in the buffer region, causing the apparent particle-to-fluid slip velocity to vanish, raises major challenges for accurately modelling lift forces. While our results confirm that lift forces have little influence on particle dynamics for sufficiently small particle sizes, for inner-scaled diameters of order one and beyond, lift forces become quite important near the wall. The different particle dynamics under lift forces results in the modulation of streamwise momentum transport in the near-wall region. We analyze this lift-induced turbulence modulation for different lift force models, and the results indicate that realistic models are critical for particle-modelled simulations to correctly predict turbulence modulation by particles in the near-wall region.</description>

      <title>Effect of Synthetic Jets Actuator Parameters on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Flow Control Performance in a Square Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to precisely control the mass flow rates of synthetic jets located on the upper and lower surfaces of a square cylinder for active flow control. Through DRL-based active flow control (AFC) technology, we significantly reduce the lift and drag coefficients of the square cylinder at Reynolds number (Re) = 100 and Re=500, while completely suppressing vortex shedding in the wake flow field. Additionally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the position and width parameters of the synthetic jets regarding flow control performance. Our observations indicate that positioning the synthetic jets near the trailing edge corners of the square cylinder, rather than the leading edge corners, can completely suppress vortex shedding, resulting in more stable lift and drag coefficients in the controlled flow. When the synthetic jets are positioned at the trailing edge corners, flow control reduces the mean drag coefficient by 14.4% and the standard deviation of the lift coefficient by 86.1% for the baseline flow at Re=100. For the baseline flow at Re=500, flow control reduces the mean drag coefficient by 51.4% and the standard deviation of the lift coefficient by 90.5%. At both Reynolds numbers, vortex shedding in the wake flow field is completely suppressed. Furthermore, using narrower synthetic jets results in a lower reduction rate of the standard deviations of the lift and drag coefficients, while increasing the mean and standard deviation of the mass flow rate of the jets used for flow control. This study provides guidance on optimizing the width and position of synthetic jets for DRL-based active flow control.</description>

      <title>Thermocapillary Thin Films: Periodic Steady States and Film Rupture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stationary, periodic solutions to the thermocapillary thin-film model
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t h + \partial_x \Bigl(h^3(\partial_x^3 h - g\partial_x h) + M\frac{h^2}{(1+h)^2}\partial_xh\Bigr) = 0,\quad t&gt;0,\ x\in \mathbb{R},
  \end{equation*} which can be derived from the B\'enard-Marangoni problem via a lubrication approximation. When the Marangoni number $M$ increases beyond a critical value $M^*$, the constant solution becomes spectrally unstable via a (conserved) long-wave instability and periodic stationary solutions bifurcate. For a fixed period, we find that these solutions lie on a global bifurcation curve of stationary, periodic solutions with a fixed wave number and mass. Furthermore, we show that the stationary periodic solutions on the global bifurcation branch converge to a weak stationary periodic solution which exhibits film rupture. The proofs rely on a Hamiltonian formulation of the stationary problem and the use of analytic global bifurcation theory. Finally, we show the instability of the bifurcating solutions close to the bifurcation point and give a formal derivation of the amplitude equation governing the dynamics close to the onset of instability.</description>

      <title>A Novel ES-BGK Model for Non-Polytropic Gases with Internal State Density Independent of the Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel ES-BGK-based model of non-polytropic rarefied gases in the framework of kinetic theory is presented. Key features of this model are: an internal state density function depending only on the microscopic energy of internal modes (avoiding the dependence on temperature seen in previous reference studies); full compliance with the H-theorem; feasibility of the closure of the system of moment equations based on the maximum entropy principle, following the well-established procedure of Rational Extended Thermodynamics.
  The structure of planar shock waves in carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) obtained with the present model is in general good agreement with that of previous results, except for the computed internal temperature profile, which is qualitatively different with respect to the results obtained in previous studies, showing here a consistently monotonous behavior across the shock structure, rather than the non monotonous behavior previously found.</description>

      <title>Simulating dynamics of ellipsoidal particles using lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic particles are often encountered in different fields of soft matter and complex fluids. In this work, we present an implementation of the coupled hydrodynamics of solid ellipsoidal particles and the surrounding fluid using the lattice Boltzmann method. A standard link-based mechanism is used to implement the solid-fluid boundary conditions. We develop an implicit method to update the position and orientation of the ellipsoid. This exploits the relations between the quaternion which describes the ellipsoid's orientation and the ellipsoid's angular velocity to obtain a stable and robust dynamic update. The proposed algorithm is validated by looking at four scenarios: (i) the steady translational velocity of a spheroid subject to an external force in different orientations, (ii) the drift of an inclined spheroid subject to an imposed force, (iii) three-dimensional rotational motions in a simple shear flow (Jeffrey's orbits), and (iv) developed fluid flows and self-propulsion exhibited by a spheroidal microswimmer. In all cases the comparison of numerical results showed good agreement with known analytical solutions, irrespective of the choice of the fluid properties, geometrical parameters, and lattice Boltzmann model, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using a deep learning model fed with high-quality data. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the fine-mesh data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error to about 50% for simulations outside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver in the x- and y-velocity components using an 8x coarser mesh. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics while generating stable predictions for mid-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Decomposing causality into its synergistic, unique, and redundant components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality lies at the heart of scientific inquiry, serving as the fundamental basis for understanding interactions among variables in physical systems. Despite its central role, current methods for causal inference face significant challenges due to nonlinear dependencies, stochastic interactions, self-causation, collider effects, and influences from exogenous factors, among others. While existing methods can effectively address some of these challenges, no single approach has successfully integrated all these aspects. Here, we address these challenges with SURD: Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition of causality. SURD quantifies causality as the increments of redundant, unique, and synergistic information gained about future events from past observations. The formulation is non-intrusive and applicable to both computational and experimental investigations, even when samples are scarce. We benchmark SURD in scenarios that pose significant challenges for causal inference and demonstrate that it offers a more reliable quantification of causality compared to previous methods.</description>
