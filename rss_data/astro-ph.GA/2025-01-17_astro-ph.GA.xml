      <title>The COSMOS-Web deep galaxy group catalog up to $z=3.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy groups with $M_{tot} \lesssim 10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg$^2$, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to $z=2$. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at $z&gt;2$. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at $2 \leq z \leq 3.7$, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to $z=3.7$, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80\%. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning $\sim$12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.</description>

      <title>Searching for Quiescent Galaxies over $3 &lt; z &lt; 6$ in JWST Surveys Using Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiescent galaxies over $3&lt;z&lt;6$ are rare and puzzling. They formed and quenched within two billion years and simulations routinely struggle to predict their observed abundances. Developing a robust identification technique for these galaxies is crucial for constraining galaxy evolution models. Traditional rest-frame color-color selection techniques for quiescent galaxies are known to break down or require adjustments at $z\gtrsim3$. Recently, observed-frame color-color criteria have been established with JWST/NIRCam colors that efficiently pre-select high-redshift quiescent galaxies using only $\lesssim1\%$ of a given sample. In this work, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine-learning technique is applied to pre-select quiescent galaxies over $3&lt;z&lt;6$ using observed NIRCam colors. From a parent sample of 43,926 galaxies in JADES, we ultimately find 44 quiescent candidates from a pool of $\approx2,300$ galaxies. This is about five times fewer galaxies than what would be pre-selected using color-color criteria. Two-thirds of these candidates can be pre-selected from a pool as small as 247, which is about twice as efficient as existing observed-frame color selection techniques. Nearly two-thirds of the candidates are new discoveries and include quiescent galaxies with mass-weighted ages as young as $\lesssim300$ Myr. We obtain number densities in agreement with the literature at $z&lt;4$ and find generally higher abundances at $z&gt;4$, although our measurements are consistent within errors. This technique may be applied to other JWST surveys.</description>

      <title>Zapped then Napped? A rapidly quenched, remnant leaker candidate with a steep spectroscopic $\beta_{UV}$ slope at z=8.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam Photometry to explore the properties of JADES-GS8-RL-1, a rapidly quenched, $z=8.5$ galaxy with a stellar mass of $10^{8.9}M_\odot$, a steep blue UV slope, a Balmer break, and no sign of strong emission lines. With a $\beta_{UV}$=-2.8$\pm 0.2$, as measured from the NIRSpec spectrum, JADES-GS8-RL-1 is consistent with negligible dust attenuation and little to no contribution from the nebular continuum alongside a probable high escape fraction. The $\beta_{UV}$ slope measured from photometry varies from -3.0 in the central regions to -2.2 at the outskirts suggesting possible regional differences in the escape fraction. There are no high-ionisation emission lines, only a tentative 2.9\sig detection of [OII]. Using photometry, this emission appears to be extended, possibly corresponding to weakly ionised gas expelled during or after the quenching process. JADES-GS8-RL-1 is spatially resolved with a half-light radius of 240 pc and has an exponential, disc-like morphology. It appears to have formed all its stars in a short burst within the past 100 Myr with a formation time of $\approx$70 Myr and a quenching time of $\approx$30 Myr. This quenching would have occurred rapidly, making it a more distant example of the kind of low-mass "mini-quenched" galaxies previously observed at high-z. Due to the extremely blue $\beta_{UV}$ slope, our best-fit model predicts a high value for \fesc of &gt;10\%, consistent with the value derived from the $\beta_{UV}$ slope, which when combined with our extraordinarily low O32 upper limit suggests JADES-GS8-RL-1 is a fascinating example of a high-z "remnant leaker" in one of its earliest phases, deep in the epoch of reionisation.</description>

      <title>Assessing the dark matter content of two quasar host galaxies at z~6 through gas kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a study of the gas kinematics of two quasar host galaxies at $z\gtrsim6$ traced by the [CII] emission line using ALMA. By combining deep observations at both low and high resolution, we recover the diffuse emission, resolve its structure, and measure the rotation curves from the inner region of the galaxy to its outskirts using DysmalPy and 3DBarolo. Assuming that both galaxies exhibit disk rotation driven by the gravitational potential of the galaxy, we find that the best-fit disk models have a $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 2$ and inferred circular velocities out to $\sim$6-8 kpc scales, well beyond the likely stellar distribution. We then determine the mass profiles of each component (stars, gas, dark matter) with priors on the baryon and dark matter properties. We find relatively large dark matter fractions within their effective radii ($f_{\rm DM}(R&lt;R_e)$ = $0.61_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ and $0.53_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$, respectively), which are significantly larger than those extrapolated from lower redshift studies and remain robust under different input parameters verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. The large $f_{\rm DM}(R&lt;R_e)$ corresponds to halo masses of $\sim 10^{12.5}-10^{12.8}\, M_\odot$, thus representative of the most massive halos at these redshifts. Notably, while the masses of these SMBHs are approximately 1 dex higher than the low-redshift relationship with stellar mass, the closer alignment of SMBH and halo masses with a local relationship may indicate that the early formation of these SMBHs is linked to their dark matter halos, providing insights into the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Ion densities of cold clouds driven by galactic outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) often display coincident absorption from species with widely varying ionization states, providing direct evidence for complex, multiphase interactions. Motivated by these measurements, we perform a series of cloud-crushing simulations that model cold clouds traveling through the hot CGM. We analyze the ion distributions of these clouds, generate mock absorption spectra, and study their implications on quasar (QSO) absorption observations. Our results show interesting multiphase features, in which ions with significantly different ionization potentials exist in the same absorber and share similar spectral features. However, our simulations are unable to explain high ions like O \textsc{vi} and their coexistence with lower ions that appear in many observed QSO absorption systems.</description>

      <title>XMM/HST monitoring of the ultra-soft highly accreting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 RBS 1332</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-soft narrow line Seyfert 1 (US-NLSy) are a poorly observed class of active galactic nuclei characterized by significant flux changes and an extreme soft X-ray excess. This peculiar spectral shape represents a golden opportunity to test whether the standard framework commonly adopted for modelling local AGN is still valid. We thus present the results on the joint XMM-Newton and HST monitoring campaign of the highly accreting US-NLSy RBS 1332. The optical-to-UV spectrum of RBS 1332 exhibits evidence of both a stratified narrow-line region and an ionized outflow, that produces absorption troughs over a wide range of velocities (from ~1500 km s-1 to ~1700 km s-1) in several high-ionization transitions (Lyalpha, N V, C IV). From a spectroscopic point of view, the optical/UV/FUV/X-rays emission of this source is due to the superposition of three distinct components which are best modelled in the context of the two-coronae framework in which the radiation of RBS 1332 can be ascribed to a standard outer disk, a warm Comptonization region and a soft coronal continuum. The present dataset is not compatible with a pure relativistic reflection scenario. Finally, the adoption of the novel model reXcor allowed us to determine that the soft X-ray excess in RBS 1332 is dominated by the emission of the optically thick and warm Comptonizing medium, and only marginal contribution is expected from relativistic reflection from a lamppost-like corona.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey &amp; ASymba: Comparing HI Detection Asymmetries to the SIMBA Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An avenue for understanding cosmological galaxy formation is to compare morphometric parameters in observations and simulations of galaxy assembly. In this second paper of the ASymba: Asymmetries of HI in SIMBA Galaxies series, we measure atomic gas HI asymmetries in spatially-resolved detections from the untargetted WALLABY survey, and compare them to realizations of WALLABY-like mock samples from the SIMBA cosmological simulations. We develop a Scanline Tracing method to create mock galaxy HI datacubes which minimizes shot noise along the spectral dimension compared to particle-based methods, and therefore spurious asymmetry contributions. We compute 1D and 3D asymmetries for spatially-resolved WALLABY Pilot Survey detections, and find that the highest 3D asymmetries A3D&gt;0.5 stem from interacting systems or detections with strong bridges or tails. We then construct a series of WALLABY-like mock realizations drawn from the SIMBA 50 Mpc simulation volume, and compare their asymmetry distributions. We find that the incidence of high A3D detections is higher in WALLABY than in the SIMBA mocks, but that difference is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.05). The statistical power of quantitative comparisons of asymmetries such as the one presented here will improve as the WALLABY survey progresses, and as simulation volumes and resolutions increase.</description>

      <title>A stellar census in globular clusters with MUSE. Metallicity spread and dispersion among first-population stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple populations are ubiquitous in the old massive globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way. It is still unclear how they arose during the formation of a GC. The topic of iron and metallicity variations has recently attracted attention with the measurement of iron variations among the primordial population (P1) stars of Galactic GCs. We use the spectra of more than 8000 RGB stars in 21 Galactic GCs observed with MUSE to derive individual stellar metallicities [M/H]. For each cluster, we use the HST photometric catalogs to separate the stars into two main populations (P1 and P2). We measure the metallicity spread within the primordial population of each cluster by combining our metallicity measurements with the stars $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color. We also derive metallicity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm [M/H]}$) for the P1 and P2 stars of each GC. In all but three GCs, we measure a significant correlation between the metallicity and the $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color of the P1 stars such that stars with larger $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ have higher metallicities. We measure metallicity spreads that range from 0.03 to 0.24 dex and correlate with the GC masses. As for the intrinsic metallicity dispersions, when combining the P1 and P2 stars, we measure values ranging from 0.02 dex to 0.08 dex that correlate very well with the GC masses. We compared the metallicity dispersion among the P1 and P2 stars and found that the P2 stars have metallicity dispersions that are smaller or equal to that of the P1 stars. We find that both the metallicity spreads of the P1 stars (from the $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ spread in the chromosome maps) and the metallicity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm [M/H]}$) correlate with the GC masses, as predicted by some theoretical self-enrichment models presented in the literature.</description>

      <title>New Methods of Identifying AGN in the Early Universe using Spectroscopy and Photometry in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore spectroscopic and photometric methods for identifying high-redshift galaxies containing an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with JWST observations. After demonstrating the limitations of standard optical methods, which appear ineffective in the low-metallicity environment of the early universe, we evaluate alternative diagnostic techniques using the current JWST observational capabilities. Our analysis focuses on line ratios and equivalent widths (EWs) of UV emission lines: CIV, HeII $\lambda$1640, OIII] $\lambda$1665, and CIII], and the faint optical line, HeII $\lambda$4686. We find that the most valuable diagnostic quantities for finding AGN are the line ratios: (CIII] + CIV) / HeII $\lambda$1640 and CIII] / HeII $\lambda$1640, as well as the EW of HeII $\lambda$1640. For more reliable AGN identification, the HeII $\lambda$1640 and OIII] $\lambda$1665 lines would need to be detected separately. We show that the HeII $\lambda$1640/H$\beta$ ratio effectively separates AGN from star-forming galaxies, though it is contingent on a low dust content. We also show that in order to effectively use these diagnostics, future observations require longer exposure times, especially for galaxies at $z &gt; 6$. Subsequently, we plot three real high-redshift sources on these diagrams which present strong UV emission lines. However, in order to classify them as strong AGN candidates, further study is needed due to the blending of HeII + OIII] and unreliable optical lines. Lastly, we carry out a selection process using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with EAZY to identify strong AGN candidates in the JADES NIRCam photometry. One galaxy in our sample emerged as a strong AGN candidate, supported by both photometric selection and strong UV emission. We present a sample of similar AGN candidates in the JADES data based on this method.</description>

      <title>SHORES: Serendipitous H-ATLAS-fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources with the ATCA. I: catalog generation and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Serendipitous H-ATLAS-fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources (SHORES) multiple pencil beam survey that observed at 2.1 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) 29 fields in total intensity and polarization within the Herschel-ATLAS Southern Galactic Field. This paper presents the observations, calibration and analysis of the 27 shallow fields that cover an overall area of $\sim 26$ square degree with increasing sensitivity towards the phase centers of each pointing according to the ATCA 22 m dish response function, down to $\sigma\lesssim 33\, \mu$Jy. Two additional (deep) fields have been observed to even higher sensitivity. All the SHORES observations have been calibrated to account also for linear polarization. Polarization and deeper field analysis will be presented in future papers. The SHORES shallow-field sample considered in the present paper counts $2294$ sources detected with BLOBCAT to signal-to-noise ratio $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$. Simulations determined that our procedure and final catalog is 95% reliable above $497.5\, \mu$Jy and $95\%$ complete to the $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$ significance level. By exploiting ATCA E-W 6 km configuration we reached resolutions of $3.2\times 7.2$ arcsec, to which level $81\%$ of our sources are unresolved. We determined source counts down to the $150\, \mu$Jy level. For the sources with a counterpart in H-ATLAS, the FIR-radio correlation is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <title>25 years of XMM-Newton observations of the Sgr A complex: 3D distribution and internal structure of the clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sgr A* is currently very faint. However, X-ray radiation reflected by the Sgr A complex, a group of nearby molecular clouds, suggests that it went through one or more periods of high activity some hundreds of years ago. We aim to determine whether previously proposed physical scenarios are consistent with the observed X-ray variability over the past 25 years, and to characterize the spatial distribution, shape, and internal structure of the clouds. We exploit the full set of XMM-Newton observations, extending the previously studied dataset on variability by at least 12 years. Starting from the recent IXPE result that places the so-called Bridge cloud 26 pc behind Sgr A*, we reconstruct the LOS position of the other clouds, assuming that they were illuminated by a single flare. Additionally, we derive the probability density function (PDF) of the molecular density. We also study the 3D geometry of the complex in case two flares illuminate the clouds. As of spring 2024, the lightfront is still illuminating the Sgr A complex, with the Bridge currently being the brightest cloud. The other clouds in the complex have faded significantly. In the single flare scenario, the Sgr A complex is located $\simeq$ 25 pc behind Sgr A*. In the past 25 years, the illuminated region spans 10-15 pc along the LOS. The derived PDF is roughly log-normal, consistent with previous Chandra results, with a possible high-density excess. Both a single and a multiple flares scenario can explain the observed X-ray variability. Previous concerns about the single flare scenario, raised by shorter monitoring, are now overcome in the 25 years of monitoring. If two flares illuminate the clouds, they must be separated by at least $\sim$ 30 years. We speculate that these clouds are closer to Sgr A* than the nuclear molecular ring at $\simeq$ 100-200 pc and possibly drifting from the ring to the inner region of the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: We use the Tolman metric to describe gravitational collapse of a sphere of a fluid without pressure in spacetime with the Hubble parameter $H$ related to the cosmological constant. We show that the largest radius of a galaxy formed from such a fluid with mass $M$ is given by $(GM/H^2)^{1/3}$.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 III: weak-lensing analysis and merging scenario reconstruction of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 ($z=0.234$) is a post-merging system that exhibits symmetric double radio relics separated by ~2.7 Mpc. We present the first weak-lensing analysis of PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 and propose possible merging scenarios using numerical simulations. Our analysis with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging identifies a binary dark matter structure consisting of northern and southern components, separated by ~500 kpc. Assuming Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos, the masses for the northern and southern subclusters are $M_{200c}^{N} = 0.88_{-0.30}^{+0.35} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{200c}^{S} = 2.71_{-0.48}^{+0.51} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, respectively. By superposing the two NFW halos, we determine the total mass of the cluster to be $M_{200c} = 4.22_{-1.00}^{+1.10} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ ($M_{500c} = 2.90_{-0.69}^{+0.75} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$). Our mass estimate suggests that the two relics are located around the cluster $R_{200c}$, where the density of the intracluster medium is very low. Our idealized simulations find that an off-axis collision of a 3:1 major merger can simultaneously reproduce the observed relic and dark matter halo separations. From these findings, we suggest that the system is observed ~0.9 Gyr after the first pericenter passage and is returning from the first apocenter.</description>

      <title>Boosting Supermassive Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe by Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe challenge existing black hole formation models. We propose that soliton cores in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) offer a potential solution to this timing problem. Our FDM cosmological zoom-in simulations confirm that for a particle mass $m_{\rm FDM}\sim 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$, solitons are well developed at redshift $z \sim 7$ with masses of $\sim10^9~M_\odot$, comparable to the observed SMBHs. We then demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations that, compared to cold dark matter, these high-$z$ massive FDM solitons with mass $M_s$ can provide additional gravitational potential to accrete gas and boost the Bondi accretion rate of a growing black hole seed with mass $M_{\rm BH}$ by up to two to four orders of magnitude, in the regime of efficient cooling and negligible radiation pressure. This accretion boosting mechanism is effective for $10^{-22}~{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm FDM} \lesssim 10^{-20}~{\rm eV}$ and potentially beyond as long as $M_s &gt; M_{\rm BH}$.

      <title>Long-term Simultaneous Monitoring Observations of SiO and H2O Masers toward the Mira Variable WX Serpentis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from long-term simultaneous monitoring observations of SiO and H2O masers toward the Mira variable star WX Serpentis. This study has been conducted with 21m single-dish radio telescopes of the Korean VLBI Network from 2009 June to 2021 June. Five maser lines were considered: SiO v=1, 2, J=1-0; SiO v=1, J=2-1, 3-2, and H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) transitions, with the SiO maser lines distributed near the stellar velocity and the H2O maser exhibiting an asymmetric line profile with five to six peaked components. Intense H2O maser emissions suddenly appeared in 2019 September, indicating flaring. The intensity variations of SiO and H2O masers are strongly correlated with the optical light curve (OLC) of the central star, with individual phase lags; the phase lag of the H2O maser relative to the OLC is larger than that of the SiO masers. The consequent phase difference between the SiO masers and the H2O maser likely indicates that their formation regions and main driving mechanisms are different from each other. The SiO masers in WX Ser exhibit a dominant single-peak velocity distribution, similar to other Mira variable stars. However, the H2O maser displays distinct morphological features, showing a radial acceleration and preferential intensity dominance at blueshifted velocities. This suggests that the H2O maser clouds of WX Ser are moving outward, thereby developing an asymmetric outflow owing to nonuniform material ejection from the stellar atmosphere. The findings confirm that an initial asymmetric outflow structure emerged during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase, specifically in the Mira variable star stage.</description>

      <title>Resolving the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation among Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Evidence for AGN-driven Hierarchical Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the correlation between the effective spins ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and mass ratios ($q$) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's binary black holes (BBHs) is still an open question. Motivated by recent identification of two subpopulations of the BBHs, in this work we investigate the potential $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ correlation for each subpopulation. Surprisingly, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation vanishes for the low-mass subpopulation if we introduce a second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the high-mass subpopulation likely originating from hierarchical mergers. The first subpopulation has a narrow $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.05$, whose primary-mass function cuts off at $\sim 45M_{\odot}$, in agreement with first-generation BBHs. The second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is broad and peaks at $\mu_{\chi,2}=0.35^{+0.18}_{-0.22}$, consistent with the expectation of hierarchical mergers formed in the disks of active galactic nucleus (AGNs). We infer $\mu_{\chi,2}&gt;0$ at 98.7\% credible level, and a symmetric $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the second subpopulation is disfavored by $\mathcal{B}\sim5$. However, negative values of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are also measured, indicating that the hierarchical mergers may take place within both star clusters and AGN disks. We find a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=5.2$ for two distinct $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distributions relative to single $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution that conditioned on mass ratios. Therefore we conclude that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation in the entire population can be explained as the superposition of two subpopulations. Additionally, we suggest to use a flexible mass function to reduce the bias in $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation that may be introduced by model mis-specification.</description>

      <title>An Intermediate-mass Black Hole Lurking in A Galactic Halo Caught Alive during Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass and supermassive black holes abound in the Universe, whereas intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of ~10^2-10^5 solar masses in between are largely missing observationally, with few cases found only. Here we report the real-time discovery of a long-duration X-ray transient, EP240222a, accompanied by an optical flare with prominent H and He emission lines revealed by prompt follow-up observations. Its observed properties evidence an IMBH located unambiguously in the halo of a nearby galaxy and flaring by tidally disrupting a star -- the only confirmed off-nucleus IMBH-tidal disruption event so far. This work demonstrates the potential of sensitive time-domain X-ray surveys, complemented by timely multi-wavelength follow-ups, in probing IMBHs, their environments, demographics, origins and connections to stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>UNCOVER: The rest ultraviolet to near infrared multiwavelength structures and dust distributions of sub-millimeter-detected galaxies in Abell 2744</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame near infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z~1-3). In this paper we leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4${\mu}$m) structures of 11 sub-millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at z~0.9-3.5 that are fainter than bright "classical" sub-mm galaxies (SMGs); 7 of which are detected in deep X-ray data. While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all are smaller and more concentrated towards longer wavelengths. Of the X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for appreciable AGN flux contributions (at ${\gtrsim}$2${\mu}$m). Excluding the two AGN-dominated objects, the smaller long wavelength sizes indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles, inferred to trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their optical profiles. The sub-mm detections and visible dust lanes suggest centrally-concentrated dust is a key driver of the observed color gradients. Further, we find that more concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame NIR to optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust. The 1.2mm flux densities and size ratios of these 9 objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry impact these galaxies' multiwavelength structures. Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative sub-mm population.</description>

      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by $\sim 1$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Bursty Star Formation in Dwarf Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxy star formation histories are theoretically expected to be bursty, potentially leaving distinct imprints on their chemical evolution. We propose that episodic starbursts with quiescent periods longer than $\sim$100 Myr should lead to discontinuous tracks in a dwarf galaxy's [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance plane, with metallicity gaps as large as 0.3-0.5 dex at [Fe/H] = -2. This occurs due to continued Fe production by Type Ia supernovae during quiescent periods. We demonstrate that Gaussian mixture models can statistically distinguish discontinuous and continuous tracks based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Applying this method to APOGEE observations of the Sculptor dSph galaxy suggests an episodic star formation history with $\sim$300 Myr quiescent periods. While current dwarf galaxy datasets are limited by small spectroscopic sample sizes, future surveys and extremely large telescopes will enable determining large numbers of precise chemical abundances, opening up the investigation of very short timescales in early dwarf galaxy formation. This unprecedentedly high time resolution of dwarf galaxy formation in the early Universe has important implications for understanding both reionization in the early Universe and the episodic star formation cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>From Halos to Galaxies. VI. Improved halo mass estimation for SDSS groups and measurement of the halo mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, galaxies form and evolve in their host dark matter (DM) halos. Halo mass is crucial for understanding the halo-galaxy connection. The abundance matching (AM) technique has been widely used to derive the halo masses of galaxy groups. However, quenching of the central galaxy can decouple the coevolution of its stellar mass and DM halo mass. Different halo assembly histories can also result in significantly different final stellar mass of the central galaxies. These processes can introduce substantial uncertainties in the halo masses derived from the AM method, particularly leading to a systematic bias between groups with star-forming centrals (blue groups) and passive centrals (red groups). To improve, we developed a new machine learning (ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations. Our results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the derived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, $\sim1/3$ more accurate than the AM method. With careful calibration of observable quantities from simulations and observations from SDSS, we apply our ML model to the SDSS Yang et al. groups to derive their halo masses down to $10^{11.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass function agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived stellar-to-halo mass relations for both red and blue groups matches well with those obtained from direct weak lensing measurements. These new halo mass estimates enable more accurate investigation of the galaxy-halo connection and the role of the halos in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxies of Radio AGN: New Views from Combining LoTSS and MaNGA Observations</title>

Abstract: We utilize a combination of radio continuum observations and optical integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data to explore the impact of radio AGN on the evolution of their host galaxies at both global and sub-galactic scales. We construct a comprehensive radio-IFS sample comprising 5548 galaxies with redshift z&lt;0.15 by cross-matching the LoTSS with the MaNGA survey. We revisit the tight linear radio continuum - star formation relation and quantify its intrinsic scatter, then use the relation to classify 616 radio-excess AGN with excessive radio luminosities over that expected from their star formation rate. Massive radio AGN host galaxies are predominantly quiescent systems, but the quenching level shows no correlation with the jet luminosity. The mass assembly histories derived from the stellar population synthesis model fitting agree with the cosmological simulations incorporating radio-mode AGN feedback models. We observe that radio AGN hosts grow faster than a control sample of galaxies matched in stellar mass, and the quenching age ($\sim$5 Gyr) is at larger lookback times than the typical radio jet age (&lt;1 Gyr). By stacking the spectra in different radial bins and comparing results for radio AGN hosts and their controls, we find emission line excess features in the nuclear region of radio AGN hosts. This excess is more prominent in low-luminosity, low-mass, and compact radio AGN. The [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios of the excessive emission line indicate that radio AGN or related jets are ionizing the surrounding interstellar medium in the vicinity of the nucleus. Our results support the scenario that the observed present-day radio AGN activity may help their host galaxies maintain quiescence through gas ionization and heating, but it is not responsible for the past quenching of their hosts.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Classical Bulges on Stellar Bars and Box-Peanut-X-Features in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic bars and their associated resonances play a significant role in shaping galaxy evolution. Resulting resonance-driven structures, like the vertically extended Boxy/Peanut X-Feature (BPX), then serve as a useful probe of the host galaxy's history. In this study, we quantify the impact of a classical bulge on the evolution of the bar and the growth of bar resonance structures. This is accomplished with a suite of isolated N-body disk galaxy simulations with bulge mass fractions ranging from 0% to 16% of the disk mass. We apply frequency analysis to the stellar orbits to analyze the variations in resonance structure evolution. Our findings indicate that a more massive initial bulge leads to the formation of a stronger and more extended bar and that each bar drives the formation of a prominent associated BPX through resonance passage. In this work, we present evidence that the formation of a BPX is driven by planar, bar-supporting orbits evolving through interaction with horizontal and vertical bar-resonances. More orbits become vertically extended when these resonances intersect, and the rate of the orbits passing through resonance is moderated by the overall fraction of vertically extended orbits. A significant bulge stabilizes the fraction of vertically extended orbits, preventing sudden resonance-induced changes. Crucially, neither sudden resonance intersection nor prolonged resonance trapping is required for BPX formation.</description>

      <title>The Local Ultraviolet to Infrared Treasury I. Survey Overview of the Broadband Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Local Ultraviolet to Infrared Treasury (LUVIT) is a Hubble Space Telescope program that combines newly acquired data in the near ultraviolet (NUV), optical, and near infrared (NIR) with archival optical and NIR imaging to produce multiband panchromatic resolved stellar catalogs for 23 pointings in 22 low-mass, star-forming galaxies ranging in distance from the outskirts of the Local Group to ~3.8 Mpc. We describe the survey design, detail the LUVIT broadband filter observations and the archival datasets included in the LUVIT reductions, and summarize the simultaneous multiband data reduction steps. The spatial distributions and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from the resulting stellar catalogs are presented for each target, from the NUV to the NIR. We demonstrate in which regions of the CMDs stars with NUV and optical, optical and NIR, and NUV through NIR detections reside. For each target, we use the results from artificial star tests to measure representative completeness, bias, and total photometric uncertainty as a function of magnitude in each broadband filter. We also assess which LUVIT targets have significant spatial variation in the fraction of stars recovered at a given magnitude. The panchromatic LUVIT stellar catalogs will provide a rich legacy dataset for a host of resolved stellar population studies.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: tracing the chemical enrichment pathways of high-redshift star-forming galaxies with O, Ar and Ne abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of nine star-forming galaxies with $\langle z \rangle = 3.95$ from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the $\alpha$-elements O, Ne and Ar. The $\alpha$-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in $\alpha$-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample approximately doubles the number of sources with measurements of ${\rm Ar/O}$ at $z &gt; 2$, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with $\rm{Ar/O} = 0.62 \pm 0.10 \, (\rm{Ar/O})_{\odot}$. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with $\rm{Ne/O} = 1.07 \pm 0.12 \, (\rm{Ne/O})_{\odot}$. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.</description>

      <title>An intriguing coincidence between the majority of vast polar structure dwarfs and a recent major merger at the M31 position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.</description>

      <title>Inadequate turbulent support in low-metallicity molecular clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic properties of molecular clouds are set by the interplay of their self-gravity, turbulence, external pressure and magnetic fields. Extended surveys of Galactic molecular clouds typically find that their kinetic energy ($E_{\rm k}$) counterbalances their self-gravitational energy ($E_{\rm g}$), setting their virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}=2E_{\rm k}/|E_{\rm g}|\approx1$. However, past studies either have been biased by the use of optically-thick lines or have been limited within the solar neighborhood and the inner Galaxy (Galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gc}&lt;R_{\rm gc,\odot} \approx 8$ kpc). Here we present sensitive mapping observations of optically thin $^{13}$CO lines towards molecular clouds in the low-metallicity Galactic outer disk ($R_{\rm gc}\sim9-24$ kpc). By combining archival data from the inner Galaxy and four nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, we reveal a systematic trend of $\alpha_{\rm vir}$, which declines from supervirial dynamic states in metal-rich clouds to extremely subvirial dynamic states in metal-poor clouds. In these metal-poor environments, turbulence alone is insufficient to counterbalance the self-gravity of a cloud. A cloud-volumetric magnetic field may replace turbulence as the dominant cloud-supporting mechanism in low-metallicity conditions, for example, the outermost galactic disks, dwarf galaxies and galaxies in the early Universe, which would then inevitably impact the initial conditions for star formation in such environments.</description>

      <title>Messier 90 galactic halo rotation in the microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We used Planck data to study the Virgo Cluster's galaxy M 90 and its surroundings. We find, as in the case of certain galaxies of the Local Group and its vicinity, a substantial temperature asymmetry that probably arises from the rotation of the M 90 halo and extends up to about one degree from its centre. This temperature asymmetry is particularly remarkable as M 90 is a rare blueshifted galaxy of the Virgo Cluster, and it thus has possible implications for the cluster internal dynamics versus the galactic halo's formation and structure. Possible explanations for the observed effect are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reverberation evidence for Stream Collision and Delayed Disk Formation in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a star passes through the tidal disruption radius of a massive black hole (BH), it can be torn apart by the tidal force of the BH, known as the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE). Since the observed UV/optical luminosity significantly exceeds the predictions of the compact disk model in classical TDE theory, two competing models, stream collision and envelope reprocessing, have been proposed to address this discrepancy. To distinguish between these models, we investigate the continuum reverberation behaviors for $\sim$30 TDEs with high-quality multi-band light curves. We found that over half of them exhibit a positive lag by a few days in UV/optical bands, indicating that their inferred sizes are significantly larger than the envelope sizes in reprocessing. Moreover, X-ray emissions not only significantly delay relative to the primary UV/optical peak but also lag behind the rebrightening bump by up to several tens of days, completely different from the X-ray illumination reprocessing. Additionally, the anti-correlated UV-optical continuum in ASASSN-15lh further disfavors the reprocessing scenario. In contrast, the model of stream collisions, combined with delayed accretion disk formation, can provide a unified explanation for the diverse TDE observations, e.g., the optical/X-ray population, the frequently observed rebrightening bump. This model describes a unification scheme wherein the UV/optical emission originates from stream collisions during the early-stage of TDE evolution and gradually transitions to being dominated by accretion disk with detectable X-ray emission in the late stage. After transitioning to a quiescent state, recurrent flares may be observed in some cases, possibly related to repeating partial TDEs.</description>

Abstract: Modern machine learning will allow for simulation-based inference from reionization-era 21cm observations at the Square Kilometre Array. Our framework combines a convolutional summary network and a conditional invertible network through a physics-inspired latent representation. It allows for an optimal and extremely fast determination of the posteriors of astrophysical and cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to non-Gaussian information makes our method a promising alternative to the established power spectra.</description>

      <title>Galactic and extragalactic probe of dark matter with LISA's binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming LISA mission will be able to detect gravitational waves from galactic and extragalactic compact binaries. Here, we report on LISA's capability to probe dark matter around these binaries if the latter constitute black holes. By analyzing the variation in the chirp mass of the binary, we show that depending on the black hole masses, LISA should be able to probe their surrounding dark matter to a luminosity distance of $\approx 1$ Gpc if such binaries are observed within the inner $\approx 10$ pc of their galactic center for particle-like dark matter or near the galactic solitonic core for wave-like dark matter. In the case a null result is recorded during the course of observation of \emph{well-localized} binaries, one can still rule out certain parameter spaces of dark matter as being the dominant contributor to the matter budget of the Universe.</description>
