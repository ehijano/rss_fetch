      <title>Photonic Rails in ML Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rail-optimized network fabrics have become the de facto datacenter scale-out fabric for large-scale ML training. However, the use of high-radix electrical switches to provide all-to-all connectivity in rails imposes massive power, cost, and complexity overheads. We propose a rethinking of the rail abstraction by retaining its communication semantics, but realizing it using optical circuit switches. The key challenge is that optical switches support only one-to-one connectivity at a time, limiting the fan-out of traffic in ML workloads using hybrid parallelisms. We introduce parallelism-driven rail reconfiguration as a solution that leverages the sequential ordering between traffic from different parallelisms. We design a control plane, Opus, to enable time-multiplexed emulation of electrical rail switches using optical switches. More broadly, our work discusses a new research agenda: datacenter fabrics that co-evolve with the model parallelism dimensions within each job, as opposed to the prevailing mindset of reconfiguring networks before a job begins.</description>

      <title>Rattan: An Extensible and Scalable Modular Internet Path Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet paths in heterogeneity, scale, and dynamics has made existing emulators increasingly insufficient in flexibility, scalability, and usability. To address these limitations, we present Rattan, an extensible and scalable software network path emulator for modern Internet conditions. Rattan's core innovation lies in its cell-based architecture: by splitting emulation functions into modular "cells" with well-documented asynchronous interfaces, users are allowed to easily compose different cells by hierarchically linking them and easily construct new cells by using standard cell interfaces. This design enables: (1) scalability, supporting hundreds of concurrent gigabit-level paths on a single machine and cluster-level experiments composed of multiple machines; (2) extensibility, simulating new network conditions by constructing new cells. Rattan empowers developers and researchers to efficiently and confidently evaluate, validate, and diagnose diverse network transport innovations for online services.</description>

      <title>KP-A: A Unified Network Knowledge Plane for Catalyzing Agentic Network Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN (to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live network knowledge Q&amp;A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future standardization efforts.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Native RAN: An Operator's Perspective of 6G Day 1 Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G, with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation with practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Optimization in Laser-charged UAV-assisted IoT Networks: A Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with Internet of Things (IoT) networks offers promising solutions for efficient data collection. However, the limited energy capacity of UAVs remains a significant challenge. In this case, laser beam directors (LBDs) have emerged as an effective technology for wireless charging of UAVs during operation, thereby enabling sustained data collection without frequent returns to charging stations (CSs). In this work, we investigate the age of information (AoI) optimization in LBD-powered UAV-assisted IoT networks, where multiple UAVs collect data from distributed IoTs while being recharged by laser beams. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to minimize the peak AoI while determining optimal UAV trajectories and laser charging strategies. This problem is particularly challenging due to its non-convex nature, complex temporal dependencies, and the need to balance data collection efficiency with energy consumption constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-agent proximal policy optimization with temporal memory and multi-agent coordination (MAPPO-TM) framework. Specifically, MAPPO-TM incorporates temporal memory mechanisms to capture the dynamic nature of UAV operations and facilitates effective coordination among multiple UAVs through decentralized learning while considering global system objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAPPO-TM algorithm outperforms conventional approaches in terms of peak AoI minimization and energy efficiency. Ideally, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 15.1% reduction in peak AoI compared to conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods.</description>

      <title>Recovery of UAV Swarm-enabled Collaborative Beamforming in Low-altitude Wireless Networks under Wind Field Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms utilizing collaborative beamforming (CB) in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) demonstrate significant potential for enhanced communication range, energy efficiency, and signal directivity through the formation of virtual antenna arrays (VAA). However, environmental disturbances, particularly wind fields, significantly degrade CB performance by introducing positional errors that disrupt beam patterns, thereby compromising transmission reliability. This paper investigates the critical challenge of maintaining CB performance in UAV-based VAAs operating in LAWN under wind field disturbances. We propose a comprehensive framework that models the impact of three distinct wind conditions (constant, shear, and turbulent) on UAV array performance, and formulate a long-term real-time optimization problem to maximize directivity while minimizing maximum sidelobe levels through adaptive excitation current weight adjustments. To address the inherent complexity of this problem, we propose a novel proximal policy optimization algorithm with long short-term memory (LSTM) structure and adaptive learning rate (PPO-LA), which effectively captures temporal patterns in wind field disturbances and enables real-time adaptation without requiring extensive prior training for specific wind conditions. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PPO-LA algorithm successfully recovers degraded CB performance across various wind scenarios, and thus significantly outperforming benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing and Optimizing Inter-Shell Routing in LEO Networks with Integrated Routing Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellation network (LMCN), which uses thousands of satellites across multi-shell architectures to deliver different services, is facing challenges in inter-shell routing stability due to dynamic network topologies and frequent inter-satellite link (ISL) switching. Existing strategies, such as the Minimum Hop Path set, prioritize minimizing hop counts to reduce latency, but ignore ISL switching costs, which leads to high instability. To overcome this, the Adaptive Path Routing Scheme introduces path similarity thresholds to reduce the ISL switching frequency between shells. However, the greedy approach of Adaptive Path Routing Scheme is often trapped in local optima, sacrificing inter-shell path distance efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Programming-based Integrated Routing Cost (DP-IRC) algorithm, which is designed explicitly for inter-shell routing optimization. By formulating multi-shell paths as a multistage decision problem, DP-IRC balances hop counts and ISL stability through an Integrated Routing Cost (IRC) metric, combining inter-/intra-shell hops and switching costs. Experiments over 60 time slots with real-world Starlink and OneWeb configurations show that DP-IRC reduces inter-shell ISL switching rates by 39.1% and 22.0% compared to the Minimum Hop Path set strategy and Adaptive Path Routing Scheme, respectively, while still maintaining near-optimal end-to-end distances.</description>

      <title>Qualitative Assessment of Low Power Wide Area Network Protocols and their Security Aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are currently many communication options in the Internet of Things, even in particular areas such as constrained and battery-powered devices, such as Low Power Wide Area Networks. Understanding the differences and characteristics of each option is a challenge, even for professionals and researchers in the field. To meet this need, this work analyses the qualitative characteristics of Low Power Wide Area Network protocols and the challenges and opportunities of using constrained devices for sparse networks based on long-life batteries. For this study, a bibliographic survey of the literature was carried out as an analysis of three protocols (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and Sigfox), and a detailing of the first one. As a result, there is a discussion about the chosen network protocol and its use in IoT solutions with sparse sensors.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph-Based approach for Sustainable 6G End-to-End System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous generations of cellular communication, such as 5G, have been designed with the objective of improving key performance indicators (KPIs) such as throughput, latency, etc. However, to meet the evolving KPI demands as well as the ambitious sustainability targets for the ICT industry, 6G will need to be designed differently. Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the performance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve. Moreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate technological enablers, making the design space of the system even more complex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability indicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in literature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to them. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system design based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its input: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key Values (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers to satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in Hexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies between the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for determining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been introduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its application in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use case defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected. Lastly, results from proof-of-concept demonstrations for a subset of the selected enablers have also been provided, which reinforce the efficacy of the KG method for designing a sustainable 6G system.</description>

      <title>Upgrade or Switch: Do We Need a Next-Gen Trusted Architecture for the Internet of AI Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built index architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2) Switch options, (3) Hybrid index/registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized indexes for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.</description>
