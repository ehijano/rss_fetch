      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of Conservation Laws from Trajectories via Neural Deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier work by a subset of the present authors, the method of the so-called neural deflation was introduced towards identifying a complete set of functionally independent conservation laws of a nonlinear dynamical system. Here, we extend by a significant step this proposal. Instead of using the explicit knowledge of the underlying equations of motion, we develop the method directly from system trajectories. This is crucial towards enhancing the practical implementation of the method in scenarios where solely data reflecting discrete snapshots of the system are available. We showcase the results of the method and the number of associated conservation laws obtained in a diverse range of examples including 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, the Toda lattice, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and the Calogero-Moser system.</description>

      <title>Creation, annihilation and transport of nonmagnetic antiskyrmions within Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic model calculations recently revealed that the polarization pattern at the cross-section through nanoscale ferroelectric nanodomains in rhombohedral barium titanate shows a clear antiskyrmion attributes such as the net invariant topological charge of minus two. The present work confirms that these topological defects also exist as local minima in the discretized Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire model, which is widely used in the phase-field modeling studies. We explore by phase-field simulations how an electric field can be used to create or move antiskyrmions within a monodomain ferroelectric matrix. The process of the field-induced antiskyrmion annihilation reveals the existence of a discrete ladder of intermediate antiskyrmion states with distinct radii but common symmetry, topology and geometrical properties.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Topological Dissipative Light Bullets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a novel class of dissipative light bullets whose spatial profiles may be drastically reshaped along the bulk, edges and corners of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice owing to the dissipative and topological nature of the system. These light bullets appear due to resonances with different modes in lattice spectrum and may have very rich shapes that can be adiabatically controlled by varying the frequency of the external laser source. We report on robust stationary bullets and breathers which are understood from the corresponding bifurcation analysis. Our results provide a new route to realisation of reconfigurable and robust 3D light forms in topologically nontrivial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this opinion article, we gathered some reflections and practical tips on what Early Stage Researchers do against inequalities in academia. This is the longer version of an opinion paper that was recently published on the website of the International Society for Optics and Photonics (spie.org), containing more details and suggestions.</description>

      <title>Optical Solitary Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate wavelet-like localized solutions in nonlinear waveguides, enabled by complementary propagation constants embedded in domains of anomalous dispersion. They are carrier-envelope-phase stable and independent of fine details of the dispersion profile. Their spectra extend over vast ranges and they are also robust against nonlinear perturbations, providing properties highly demanded in ultrafast science. In the limits of low and high energies, approximate representations are given by modified Morlet wavelets and Gaussian pulses, respectively. We demonstrate their special features by exploiting general principles of quantum scattering theory and solid-state physics, realizing interlocked chains of wavelets analog to photonic time crystals.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic description of a feedback-control Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.</description>

      <title>Incommensurable matter-wave jets in quasi-1D geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>
