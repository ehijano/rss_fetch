      <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems: all at once and all in the same place</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems -- which(1) relates attractors and repellers to the chain recurrent set and (2) gives the existence of a complete Lyapunov function -- can be seen as a means of separating out ``recurrent'' and ``transient'' dynamics. An overview of this theorem is given in its various guises, continuous-time/discrete-time and flows/semiflows. As part of this overview, a unified approach is developed for working simultaneously with both the continuous-time and discrete-time frameworks for topological dynamics. Additionally, a complete Lyapunov function is provided for the first time for continuous-time flows and semiflows.</description>

      <title>On the analytic properties of the perturbing function in the PCR3Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new expansion of the Fourier coefficient of the Perturbing function of the PCR3Body problem in terms of Hansen Coefficients. This gives us a precise asymptotic formula for the coefficient in the region of application of KAM theory (i.e small value of eccentricity and semi-major axis see e.g. \cite{Celletti-Chierchia}). Moreover, in the above region, we study the presence of zeros of the Fourier coefficient for coprime modes $(m,k) \in \Z^2$ and the presence of common zeros between coefficients relative to modes $(m,k)$,$(2m,2k)$ and $(m,k)$,$(2m,2k)$,$(3m,3k)$. Thanks to the previous expansion, this numerical analysis is done up to order $60$ in the power of eccentricity and semimajor axis. This is a first step for a possible application of \cite{Singular KAM, BBCZ} to PCR3Body Problem that would imply a reduction in terms of measure in the phase space of the so called "non--torus" set from $O(1-\sqrt{\e})$ (implied by standard KAM theory) to $O(1-\e |\log\e|^c )$ for some $c&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Memorisation and forgetting in a learning Hopfield neural network: bifurcation mechanisms, attractors and basins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features, including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to mitigate their flaws.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for the valence of certain logharmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a logharmonic polynomial; that is, a product of the form $p(z)\overline{q(z)}$, where $p$, $q$ are holomorphic polynomials. Assume $q$ is linear and denote by $n$ the degree of $p$. It was recently shown in arXiv:2302.04339 [math.CV] that the valence of such a logharmonic polynomial is at most $3n-1$; in this paper we show that their $3n-1$ upper bound is sharp. Together with the work of arXiv:2302.04339 [math.CV], this resolves a conjecture of Bshouty and Hengartner.</description>

      <title>On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance Laws With a Time-Dependent Source Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of one conservation law and one balance law with a time-dependent source term, and provide a comprehensive analysis of Riemann solutions, including the non-classical overcompressive delta shocks. The minimal yet representative structure of the system captures essential features of transport under density constraints and, despite its simplicity, serves as a versatile prototype for crowd-limited transport processes across diverse contexts, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. In addition to non-self-similar solutions mentioned above, the associated Riemann problem admits solution structures that traverse vacuum states ($\rho = 0$) and the critical density threshold ($\rho = \bar{\rho}$), where mobility vanishes and characteristic speed degenerates. Moreover, the explicit time dependence in the source term leads to the breakdown of self-similarity, resulting in distinct Riemann solutions over successive time intervals and highlighting the dynamic nature of the solution landscape. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>

      <title>A universal extension of helicity to topological flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helicity is a fundamental conserved quantity in physical systems governed by vector fields whose evolution is described by volume-preserving transformations on a three-manifold. Notable examples include inviscid, incompressible fluid flows, modeled by the three-dimensional Euler equations, and conducting plasmas, described by the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. A key property of helicity is its invariance under volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. In an influential article from 1973, Arnold, having provided an ergodic interpretation of helicity as the "asymptotic Hopf invariant", posed the question of whether this invariance persists under volume-preserving homeomorphisms. More generally, he asked whether helicity can be extended to topological volume-preserving flows. We answer both questions affirmatively for flows without rest points. Our approach reformulates Arnold's question in the framework of what we call $C^0$ Hamiltonian structures. This perspective enables us to leverage recent developments in $C^0$ symplectic geometry, particularly results concerning the algebraic structure of the group of area-preserving homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>The phi-Process: Operator-Algebraic Embeddings of Possibilities, Transfinite Stabilization, and a Quantitative Application to Sensory Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize a transfinite Phi process that treats all possibility embeddings as operators on structured state spaces including complete lattices, Banach and Hilbert spaces, and orthomodular lattices. We prove a determinization lemma showing that lifting to sets or distributions yields a deterministic global dynamic, an ordinal stabilization theorem sending operator transforms to the fixed subspace by stage omega under normal spectral contraction, and a product of Riesz projections theorem for commuting layers. We establish a compositionality law for lifted maps, show closure of Phi packings, and present a quantitative application to sensory depletion that models tissue removal as a projection and derives strict decreases in the attainable fixed point under minimal monotonicity and positivity assumptions. We also state measurable conditions for probabilistic lifts, give explicit non normal and non commuting counterexamples, and provide finite dimensional and stochastic witnesses together with per theorem scope tables and a small reproducible code appendix.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Effects in a Weakly Nonholonomic Systems With a Small Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1986 Ya.V. Tatarinov presented the foundations of the theory of weakly nonholonomic systems. Mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints depending on a small parameter are considered. It is assumed that for zero value of this parameter the constraints of such a system become integrable; i.e., in this case, we have a family of holonomic systems depending on several arbitrary integration constants. We will assume that these holonomic systems are completely integrable Hamiltonian systems. When the small parameter is not zero, the behavior of such systems can be considered with the help of normalization methods.
  The behavior of such a system can be represented as a combination of the motion of a slightly modified holonomic system with slowly varying previous integration constants (the transgression effect). In this paper we describe the corresponding effects in a several nonholonomic systems with a small degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Controlling complex rhythms: A hierarchical approach to limit cycle switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limit cycles are self-sustained, closed trajectories in phase space representing (un)-stable, periodic behavior in nonlinear dynamical systems. They underpin diverse natural phenomena, from neuronal firing patterns to engineering oscillations. The presence of multiple concentric limit cycles reflects distinct behavioral symmetries within a system. In this work, we investigate the hierarchical dynamical transitions from one limit cycle to another, driven by oscillatory excitation while preserving other system properties. We demonstrate that controlling multirhythmicity through hierarchical, stepwise periodic modulation enables reliable switching between rhythmic states. This hierarchical control framework is crucial for applications in neuro-engineering and synthetic biology, where precise, robust modulation of complex rhythmic behaviors enhances system functionality and adaptability.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this survey is to present intimate interactions between four branches of conformal dynamics: iterations of anti-rational maps, actions of Kleinian reflection groups, dynamics generated by Schwarz reflections in quadrature domains, and algebraic correspondences. We start with several examples of Schwarz reflections as well as algebraic correspondences obtained by matings between anti-rational maps and reflection groups, and examples of Julia set realizations for limit sets of reflection groups (including classical Apollonian-like gaskets). We follow up these examples with dynamical relations between explicit Schwarz reflection parameter spaces and parameter spaces of anti-rational maps and of reflection groups. These are complemented by a number of general results and illustrations of important technical tools, such as David surgery and straightening techniques. We also collect several analytic applications of the above theory.</description>

Abstract: Given a continuous linear cocycle A over a homeomorphism f of a compact metric space X, we investigate its set R of Lyapunov-Perron regular points, that is, the collection of trajectories of f that obey the conclusions of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem. We obtain results roughly saying that the set R is of first Baire category (i.e., meager) in X, unless some rigid structure is present. In some settings, this rigid structure forces the Lyapunov exponents to be defined everywhere and to be independent of the point; that is what we call complete regularity.</description>

      <title>Measures and Trajectory Properties in Oscillator Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of trajectories in harmonic oscillator systems equipped with a point, absolutely continuous, or singular measure. As demonstrated in [30], infinite-dimensional linear flows of countable oscillator systems exhibit a new class of trajectory behavior. Specifically, these trajectories are non-periodic, and their projections onto any four-dimensional symplectic subspace fail to be dense in the corresponding projection of the invariant torus. Such trajectories do not arise in finite-dimensional systems, are non-generic for countable oscillator systems, but become generic in the continual case. We prove that for a countable harmonic oscillator system, every point on a non-degenerate invariant torus is a non-wandering point of the flow. In contrast, for a continual system with an absolutely continuous measure, all points on such a torus are wandering. Furthermore, for continual systems with a singular measure, we establish sufficient conditions on the measure and torus that rule out the existence of both transitive trajectories and non-wandering points. As an application, we exhibit a class of singular Bernoulli measures satisfying these conditions.</description>

Abstract: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective intervention for preventing HIV transmission, but its high cost and uneven uptake raise challenges. While spillover effects - wherein PrEP use in one group reduces infections in others - are known to occur, they remain poorly quantified and rarely guide policy. We develop and analyze a novel compartmental HIV model that stratifies the population into three interacting subgroups: heterosexual males (HETM), heterosexual females (HETF), and men who have sex with men (MSM). We derive standard results, including the control reproduction number, and establish conditions for local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. We provide a closed-form, time-resolved expression for the spillover-adjusted number needed to treat (NNT), a measure of the population-level impact of PrEP uptake in one group on incidence in others. Simulations calibrated to Georgia state-level data reveal that PrEP delivery to MSM yields substantial indirect benefits, particularly for HETF, where the spillover effect exceeds the direct effect by a factor of five. We extend the baseline model to include risk stratification within HETF, showing that targeting high-risk HETF outperforms direct PrEP delivery to HETM, emphasizing the importance of intra-group heterogeneity. To evaluate whether these findings persist under more detailed assumptions, we embed our framework into the national HOPE model maintained by the CDC and conduct global sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices. This approach extends our analytical insights and quantifies how uncertainty in PrEP allocation strategies propagates through complex dynamics. Our results show that moderately complex, analytically tractable models can yield realistic and actionable guidance for HIV control-capturing nonlinear spillover dynamics in ways that remain interpretable even in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Approximate control of the marked length spectrum by short geodesics</title>

Abstract: The marked length spectrum (MLS) of a closed negatively curved manifold $(M, g)$ is known to determine the metric $g$ under various circumstances. We show that in these cases, (approximate) values of the MLS on a sufficiently large finite set approximately determine the metric. Our approach is to recover the hypotheses of our main theorems in arXiv:2203.12128, namely multiplicative closeness of the MLS functions on the entire set of closed geodesics of $M$. We use mainly dynamical tools and arguments, but take great care to show the constants involved depend only on concrete geometric information about the given Riemannian metrics, such as the dimension, sectional curvature bounds, and injectivity radii.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that for any finite coloring of N there are lambda,rho in N such that infinitely many pairs (x,y),(u,v) in N^2 satisfy the sets {lambda x, lambda y, x y, lambda(x+y)} and {u+rho, v+rho, u v+rho, u+v} being monochromatic. Using related arguments we also give two different proofs of a special case of the Milliken--Taylor theorem.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the hyperbolic marked energy spectrum and entropy for $k$-surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Labourie raised the question of determining the possible asymptotics for the growth rate of compact $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, in negatively curved $3$-manifolds, indicating the possibility of a theory of thermodynamical formalism for this class of surfaces. Motivated by this question and by analogous results for the geodesic flow, we prove a number of results concerning the asymptotic behavior of high energy $k$-surfaces, especially in relation to the curvature of the ambient space.
  First, we determine a rigid upper bound for the growth rate of quasi-Fuchsian $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, and with asymptotically round limit set, subject to a lower bound on the sectional curvature of the ambient space. We also study the marked energy spectrum for $k$-surfaces, proving a number of domination and rigidity theorems in this context. Finally, we show that the marked area and energy spectra for $k$-surfaces in $3$-dimensional manifolds of negative curvature are asymptotic if and only if the sectional curvature is constant.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptive learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.</description>

      <title>Rule-based Generation of de Bruijn Sequences: Memory and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate binary sequences generated by non-Markovian rules with memory length $\mu$, similar to those adopted in Elementary Cellular Automata. This generation procedure is equivalente to a shift register and certain rules produce sequences with maximal periods, known as de Bruijn sequences. We introduce a novel methodology for generating de Bruijn sequences that combines: (i) a set of derived properties that significantly reduce the space of feasible generating rules, and (ii) a neural network-based classifier that identifies which rules produce de Bruijn sequences. Experiments for large values of $\mu$ demonstrate the approach's effectiveness and computational efficiency.</description>
