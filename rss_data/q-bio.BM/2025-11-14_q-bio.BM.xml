      <title>Prebiotic Chemistry Insights for Dragonfly: Thermodynamics of Amino Acid Synthesis in Selk Crater on Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saturnian moon Titan presents a compelling testbed for probing prebiotic chemistry beyond early Earth. Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine. The first three offer the best chances for amino acid detection regardless of ammonia availability; the latter two offer diagnostic tools for determining the presence of reactive sulfur in post-impact Titan ponds.</description>

      <title>How Evaluation Choices Distort the Outcome of Generative Drug Discovery</title>

Abstract: "How to evaluate the de novo designs proposed by a generative model?" Despite the transformative potential of generative deep learning in drug discovery, this seemingly simple question has no clear answer. The absence of standardized guidelines challenges both the benchmarking of generative approaches and the selection of molecules for prospective studies. In this work, we take a fresh - critical and constructive - perspective on de novo design evaluation. By training chemical language models, we analyze approximately 1 billion molecule designs and discover principles consistent across different neural networks and datasets. We uncover a key confounder: the size of the generated molecular library significantly impacts evaluation outcomes, often leading to misleading model comparisons. We find increasing the number of designs as a remedy and propose new and compute-efficient metrics to compute at large-scale. We also identify critical pitfalls in commonly used metrics - such as uniqueness and distributional similarity - that can distort assessments of generative performance. To address these issues, we propose new and refined strategies for reliable model comparison and design evaluation. Furthermore, when examining molecule selection and sampling strategies, our findings reveal the constraints to diversify the generated libraries and draw new parallels and distinctions between deep learning and drug discovery. We anticipate our findings to help reshape evaluation pipelines in generative drug discovery, paving the way for more reliable and reproducible generative modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>
