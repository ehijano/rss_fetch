      <title>Inferentialist Public Announcement Logic: Base-extension Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof-theoretic semantics, and base-extension semantics in particular, can be seen as a logical realization of inferentialism, in which the meaning of expressions is understood through their use. We present a base-extension semantics for public announcement logic, building on earlier work giving a base-extension semantics for the modal logic $S5$, which in turn builds on earlier such work for $K$, $KT$, $K4$, and $S4$. These analyses rely on a notion of `modal relation' on bases. The main difficulty in extending the existing B-eS for $S5$ to public announcement logic is to account announcements of the form $[\psi]\phi$, which, in this setting, update the modal relations on bases. We provide a detailed analysis of two classical examples, namely the three-player card game and the muddy children puzzle. These examples illustrate how the inferentialist perspective requires fully explicit information about the state of the participating agents.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously nonvanishing higher derived limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derived functors $\lim^n$ of the inverse limit find many applications in algebra and topology. In particular, the vanishing of certain derived limits $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H]$, parametrized by an abelian group $H$, has implications for strong homology and condensed mathematics. In this paper, we prove that if $\mathfrak{d}=\omega_n$, then $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H] \neq 0$ holds for $H=\mathbb{Z}^{(\omega_n)}$ (i.e. the direct sum of $\omega_n$-many copies of $\mathbb{Z}$). The same holds for $H=\mathbb{Z}$ under the assumption that $\mathrm{w}\diamondsuit(S^{k+1}_k)$ holds for all $k &lt; n$. In particular, this shows that if $\lim^n \mathbf{A}[H] = 0$ holds for all $n \geq 1$ and all abelian groups $H$, then $2^{\aleph_0} \geq \aleph_{\omega+1}$, thus answering a question of Bannister. Finally, we prove some consistency results regarding simultaneous nonvanishing of derived limits, again in the case of $H = \mathbb{Z}$. In particular, we show the consistency, relative to $\mathsf{ZFC}$, of $\bigwedge_{2 \leq k &lt; \omega} \lim^k \mathbf{A} \neq 0$.</description>

      <title>From Numbers to Ur-Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine two ways of coding sequences in arithmetical theories. We investigate under what conditions they work. To be more precise, we study the creation of objects of a data-type that we call ur-strings, roughly sequences where the components are ordered but where we do not have an explicitly given projection function.
  First, we have a brief look at the beta-function which was already carefully studied by Emil Je\v{r}\'abek. We study in detail our two target constructions. These constructions both employ theories of strings. The first is based on Smullyan coding and the second on the representation of binary strings in the special linear monoid of the non-negative part of discretely ordered commutative rings as introduced by Markov.</description>

      <title>Tho Modal Logic of Minimal Upper Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To formalize patterns of information increase and decrease, Van Benthem (1996) proposed modal information logic (MIL), a modal logic over partial orders. In MIL, points are interpreted as information states and least upper bounds, when existent, as informational sums. A natural counterpart to this logic is the modal logic of minimal upper bounds (MIN), interpreting minimal, rather than least, upper bounds as informational sums.
  This paper presents the logic MIN, and in the main result, it is shown that the modal language cannot distinguish the two interpretations: a formula is valid in MIN if and only if it is valid in MIL. Leveraging the work of [11], as corollaries, an axiomatization of MIN and a proof of decidability are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the equational theory of Kleene algebra with commutativity
  conditions on primitives (or atomic terms) is undecidable, thereby settling a
  longstanding open question in the theory of Kleene algebra. While this
  question has also been recently solved independently by Kuznetsov, our results
  hold even for weaker theories that do not support the induction axioms
  of Kleene algebra.</description>

      <title>Approximation of hyperarithmetic analysis by $\omega$-model reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two types of results related to hyperarithmetic analysis. First, we introduce new variants of the dependent choice axiom, namely $\mathrm{unique}~\Pi^1_0(\mathrm{resp.}~\Sigma^1_1)\text{-}\mathsf{DC}_0$ and $\mathrm{finite}~\Pi^1_0(\mathrm{resp.}~\Sigma^1_1)\text{-}\mathsf{DC}_0$. These variants imply $\mathsf{ACA}_0^+$ but do not imply $\Sigma^1_1\mathrm{~Induction}$. We also demonstrate that these variants belong to hyperarithmetic analysis and explore their implications with well-known theories in hyperarithmetic analysis. Second, we show that $\mathsf{RFN}^{-1}(\mathsf{ATR}_0)$, a class of theories defined using the $\omega$-model reflection axiom, approximates to some extent hyperarithmetic analysis, and investigate the similarities between this class and hyperarithmetic analysis.</description>

      <title>Advances in Algorithmic Meta Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tractability results for the model checking problem of logics yield powerful algorithmic meta theorems of the form: Every computational problem expressible in a logic $L$ can be solved efficiently on every class $\mathscr{C}$ of structures satisfying certain conditions. The most prominent logics studied in the field are (counting) monadic second-order logic (C)MSO, and first-order logic FO and its extensions. The complexity of CMSO model checking in general and of FO model checking on monotone graph classes is very well understood. In recent years there has been a rapid and exciting development of new algorithmic meta theorems. On the one hand there has been major progress for FO model checking on hereditary graph classes. This progress was driven by the development of a combinatorial structure theory for the logically defined monadically stable and monadically dependent graph classes, as well as by the advent of the new width measure twinwidth. On the other hand, new algorithmic meta theorems for new logics with expressive power between FO and CMSO offer a new unifying view on methods like the irrelevant vertex technique and recursive understanding. In this paper we overview the recent advances in algorithmic meta theorems and provide rough sketches for the methods to prove them.</description>

      <title>Universal Sets for Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate variants of Marstrand's projection theorem that hold for sets of directions and classes of sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We say that a set of directions $D \subseteq\mathcal{S}^1$ is $\textit{universal}$ for a class of sets if, for every set $E$ in the class, there is a direction $e\in D$ such that the projection of $E$ in the direction $e$ has maximal Hausdorff dimension. We construct small universal sets for certain classes. Particular attention is paid to the role of regularity. We prove the existence of universal sets with arbitrarily small positive Hausdorff dimension for the class of weakly regular sets. We prove that there is a universal set of zero Hausdorff dimension for the class of AD-regular sets.</description>

      <title>In 1955, Paul Lorenzen clears the sky in foundations of mathematics for Hermann Weyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1955, Paul Lorenzen is a mathematician who devotes all his research to foundations of mathematics, on a par with Hans Hermes, but his academic background is algebra in the tradition of Helmut Hasse and Wolfgang Krull. This shift from algebra to logic goes along with his discovery that his ``algebraic works [...] have been concerned with a problem that has formally the same structure as the problem of consistency of the classical calculus of logic'' (letter to Carl Friedrich Gethmann dated 14 January 1988). After having provided a proof of consistency for arithmetic in 1944 and published it in 1951, Lorenzen inquires still further into the foundations of mathematics and arrives at the conviction that analysis can also be given a predicative foundation. Wilhelm Ackermann as well as Paul Bernays have pointed out to him in 1947 that his views are very close to those proposed by Hermann Weyl in Das Kontinuum (1918): sets are not postulated to exist beforehand; they are being generated in an ongoing process of comprehension. This seems to be the reason for Lorenzen to get into contact with Weyl, who develops a genuine interest into Lorenzen's operative mathematics and welcomes with great enthusiasm his Einf{\"u}hrung in die operative Logik und Mathematik (1955), which he studies line by line. This book's aim is to grasp the objects of analysis by means of inductive definitions; the most famous achievement of this enterprise is a generalised inductive formulation of the Cantor-Bendixson theorem that makes it constructive. This mathematical kinship is brutally interrupted by Weyl's death in 1955; a planned visit by Lorenzen at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton takes place only in 1957--1958. As told by Kuno Lorenz, Lorenzen's first Ph.D. student, a discussion with Alfred Tarski during this visit provokes a turmoil in Lorenzen's operative research program that leads to his abandonment of language levels and to a great simplification of his presentation of analysis by distinguishing only between ``definite'' and ``indefinite'' quantifiers: the former govern domains for which a proof of consistency is available and secures the use of the law of excluded middle; the latter govern those for which there isn't, e.g. the real numbers. Lorenzen states in his foreword to Differential und Integral (1965) that he is faithful to Weyl's approach of Das Kontinuum in this simplification. This history motivates a number of mathematical and philosophical issues about predicative mathematics: how does Weyl's interest into Lorenzen's operative mathematics fit with his turn to Brouwer's intuitionism as expressed in ``{\"U}ber die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik'' (1921)? Why does Lorenzen turn away from his language levels and how does this turn relate to Weyl's conception of predicative mathematics? What do Lorenzen's conceptions of mathematics reveal about Weyl's conceptions?</description>

Abstract: We introduce the split principles and show that they bear tight connections to large cardinal properties such as inaccessibility, weak compactness, subtlety, almost ineffability and ineffability, as well as classical combinatorial objects such as Aronszajn trees, Souslin trees or square principles. We exhibit correspondences between certain split principles and splitting numbers at uncountable cardinals.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Lorenzen's "Algebraic and logistic investigations on free lattices" (1951)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.06139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorenzen's ``Algebraische und logistische Untersuchungen \"uber freie Verb\"ande'' appeared in 1951 in The Journal of Symbolic Logic. These ``Investigations'' have immediately been recognised as a landmark in the history of infinitary proof theory. Their approach and method of proof have not been incorporated into the corpus of proof theory. Lorenzen proves the admissibility of cut by double induction, on the cut formula and on the complexity of the derivations, without using any ordinal assignment, contrary to the presentation of cut elimination in most standard texts on proof theory. We propose this introduction with the intent of giving a new impetus to their reception. The ``Investigations'' are best known for providing a constructive proof of consistency for ramified type theory without axiom of reducibility. They do so by showing that it is a part of a trivially consistent ``inductive calculus'' that describes our knowledge of arithmetic without detour. The proof resorts only to the inductive definition of formulas and theorems. They propose furthermore a definition of a semilattice, of a distributive lattice, of a pseudocomplemented semilattice, and of a countably complete boolean algebra as deductive calculuses, and show how to present them for constructing conservatively the respective free object over a given preordered set. They illustrate that lattice theory is a bridge between algebra and logic for which the construction of an element corresponds to a step in a proof. We shall describe the history of their reception, which focusses mainly on the omega-rule. The fruitfulness of this device is immediately recognised by Kurt Sch\"utte. It triggers the analysis by Ackermann (1951) of the infinitary inductive definition of the accessibility predicate with the goal of proving transfinite induction up to ordinal terms beyond epsilon_0, which is also taken over by Sch\"utte (1952).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the notion of a generically extendible cardinal, which is a generic version of an extendible cardinal. We prove that the generic extendibility of $\omega_1$ or $\omega_2$ has small consistency strength, but that of a cardinal $&gt;\omega_2$ does not. We also consider some results concerned with generically extendible cardinals, such as indestructibility, generic absoluteness of the reals, and Boolean valued second order logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact Boolean algebras are one of the main algebraic tools in region-based theory of space. T. Ivanova provided strong motivations for the study of merely semilattices with a contact relation. Another significant motivation for considering an even weaker underlying structure comes from event structures with binary conflict in the theory of concurrent systems in computer science.
  All the above-hinted notions deal with a binary contact relation. Several authors suggested the more general study of $n$-ary ``hypercontact'' relations and noticed that, in general, a hypercontact relation cannot be retrieved from just a binary contact relation. A similar evolution occurred in the study of the just mentioned event structures in computer science.
  In an effort to unify the above lines of research, in this paper we study join semilattices with a hypercontact relation. We provide representation theorems into Boolean algebras, with or without overlap hypercontact relation. With a single exception, our proofs are choice-free. We also present several examples and problems; in particular, we briefly discuss some connections with event structures and hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Complete and Terminating Tableau Calculus for Undirected Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid logic is a modal logic with additional operators specifying nominals and is highly expressive. For example, there is no formula corresponding to the irreflexivity of Kripke frames in basic modal logic, but there is in hybrid logic. Irreflexivity is significant in that irreflexive and symmetric Kripke frames can be regarded as undirected graphs reviewed from a graph theoretic point of view. Thus, the study of the hybrid logic with axioms corresponding to irreflexivity and symmetry can help to elucidate the logical properties of undirected graphs. In this paper, we formulate the tableau method of the hybrid logic for undirected graphs. Our main result is to show the completeness theorem and the termination property of the tableau method, which leads us to prove the decidability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we give a very short introduction to Formal Concept Analysis, accompanied by an example in order to build concept lattices from a context. We build the lattice using the Java-based software Concept Explorer (ConExp) in a recent version of Linux. Installing an appropriate Java version is necessary, because ConExp was developed some time ago using a Sun Java version, which is not open-source. As a result, it has been observed that ConExp will not build a lattice when started with an open-source Java version. Therefore, we also sketch the procedure we followed to install an appropriate Java version which makes ConExp work again, i.e., to "build lattices again". We also show how to start ConExp with a 32 bit Java version, which requires a few additional libraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore various semantic understandings of dual intuitionistic logic by exploring the relationship between co-Heyting algebras and topological spaces. First, we discuss the relevant ideas in the setting of Heyting algebras and intuitionistic logic, showing organically the progression from the primordial example of lattices of open sets of topological spaces to more general ways of thinking about Heyting algebras. Then, we adapt the ideas to the dual intuitionistic setting, and use them to prove a number of interesting properties, including a deep relationship both intuitionistic and dual intuitionistic logic share through Kripke semantics to the modal logic $\mathsf{S4}$.</description>

      <title>Stationary Reflection and the Failure OF SCH at $\aleph_{\omega_1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining stationary reflection (a compactness property) with the failure of SCH (an instance of non-compactness) has been a long-standing theme. We obtain this at $\aleph_{\omega_1}$, answering a question of Ben-Neria, Hayut, and Unger: We prove from the existence of uncountably many supercompact cardinals the consistency of $\aleph_{\omega_1}$ is strong limit together with $2^{\aleph_{\omega_1}}&gt;\aleph_{\omega_1+1}$ and every stationary set of $\aleph_{\omega_1+1}$ reflects.</description>

      <title>An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of satisfiability of sets of constraints in a given set of finite uniform hypergraphs. While the problem under consideration is similar in nature to the problem of satisfiability of constraints in graphs, the classical complexity reduction to finite-domain CSPs that was used in the proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems cannot be used as a black box in our case. We therefore introduce an algorithmic technique inspired by classical notions from the theory of finite-domain CSPs, and prove its correctness based on symmetries that depend on a linear order that is external to the structures under consideration. Our second main result is a P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for such problems over many sets of uniform hypergraphs. The proof is based on the translation of the problem into the framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over infinite uniform hypergraphs. Our result confirms in particular the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture for CSPs of first-order reducts of some homogeneous hypergraphs. This forms a vast generalization of previous work by Bodirsky-Pinsker (STOC'11) and Bodirsky-Martin-Pinsker-Pongr\'acz (ICALP'16) on graph satisfiability.</description>

      <title>Pointfree topology and constructive mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constructive approach to mathematics has the advantage that witnesses can be extracted from statements of existence and theorems can be unwound to give algorithms. Even better, constructive theorems can be interpreted in any topos, giving many different results for the price of one. On the other hand, you might have heard that fundamental results from topology such as Tychonoff's theorem or even the intermediate value theorem do not hold constructively, which can make the price of constructive theorems seem rather steep. However, almost all of these pathologies disappear if we take the pointfree approach to topology, in which spaces are studied algebraically and logically through their lattices of opens without reference to a predefined underlying set of points. In fact, this perspective also sheds light on aspects of constructive mathematics that might at first appear to have little to do with topology. These notes provide a gentle introduction to the main aspects of constructive pointfree topology and some of its applications.</description>
