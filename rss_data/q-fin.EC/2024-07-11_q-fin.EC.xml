      <title>Valuation of travel time savings in the presence of simultaneous activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time sharing between activities remains an indispensable part of everyday activity pattern. However, the issue has not yet been fully acknowledged within the existing time allocation models, potentially resulting in inaccuracies in valuing travel time savings. Therefore this study is aimed at addressing this gap by investigating the potential impact of introducing time sharing within such a framework, as well as factors determining it as represented by travel activities. In doing so, time constraint in the time allocation model of Small was modified to enable sharing the same time interval between different activities. The resulting expression indicated that such an augmentation could lead to lower estimates of value of time as a resource. On the other hand, empirical research based on the data from the National Passenger Survey 2004 used for calibrating cross-nested logit model indicated a number of factors affecting the choice of travel activities. It was discovered that significant include possession of equipment allowing particular activities, e.g. newspaper, paperwork or ICT devices, companionship, gender, length of the journey, frequency of using the service, possibility of working on the train, journey planning in advance, first class travel, termination of the trip in central London, peak-time travel and availability of seating.</description>

      <title>Herding Unmasked: Insights into Cryptocurrencies, Stocks and US ETFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herding behavior has become a familiar phenomenon to investors, carrying the potential danger of both undervaluing and overvaluing assets, while also threatening market stability. This study contributes to the literature on herding behavior by using a more recent dataset to cover the most impactful events of recent years. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining herding behavior across three different types of investment vehicle. Furthermore, this is also the first study observing herding at a community (subset) level. Specifically, we first explore this phenomenon in each separate type of investment vehicle, namely stocks, US ETFs and cryptocurrencies, using the widely recognized Cross Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD) model. We find similar herding patterns between stocks and US ETFs, while these traditional assets reveal a distinction from cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, the same experiment is implemented on a combination of all three investment vehicle types. For a deeper investigation, we adopt graph-based techniques such as Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Louvain community detection to partition the given combination into smaller subsets whose assets are most similar to each other, then seek to detect the herding behavior on each subset. We find that herding behavior exists at all times across all types of investment vehicle at a subset level, although the herding might not manifest at the superset level. Additionally, this herding behavior tends to stem from specific events that solely impact that subset of assets. Given these findings, investors can construct an appropriate investment strategy composed of their choice of investment vehicles they are interested in.</description>
