      <title>Distributed Satellites Dynamic Allocation for Grids with Time Windows: A Potential Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allocation of tasks to a large number of distributed satellites is a difficult problem owing to dynamic changes in massive tasks and the complex matching of tasks to satellites. To reduce the complexity of the problem, tasks that are geographically close can be divided into a predefined grid with a specific time window and processed together. The problem then becomes a dynamic grid with time-window allocation problem (DGAP). To ensure consistent visibility between satellites and grids, the timeline of the DGAP is partitioned into several decision-making stages that are determined by dynamic changes in the time window. Subsequently, the DGAP can be resolved progressively adopting the potential game approach in the single-stage DGAP (sDGAP). First, to solve the discontinuity in the goal of the sDGAP, we approximate the goal by a smooth exponential sum function that we regard as the global utility function. Second, a potential game theoretic framework is constructed by decomposing this global utility function into the local utility functions of individuals. We prove that each Nash equilibrium of the proposed potential game is the optimal solution of the sDGAP. Third, to solve the potential game, a distributed algorithm, referred to as the selective time-variant better reply process (SeTVBRP) algorithm, is proposed and its convergence is proved. The SeTVBRP algorithm is an improved algorithm based on the better reply process algorithm, where two improvement methods (i.e., the selective action method and time-variant parameter method) are introduced. Through factor analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the two improvement methods for the sDGAP. Last, numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing learning algorithms and is effective in solving the DGAP.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Clustering Algorithm based on Coalition Game for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), the hierarchical management of intelligent vehicles, based on clustering methods, represents a well-established solution for effectively addressing scalability and reliability issues. The previous studies have primarily focused on centralized clustering problems with a single objective. However, this paper investigates the distributed clustering problem that simultaneously optimizes two objectives: the cooperative capacity and management overhead of cluster formation, under dynamic network conditions. Specifically, the clustering problem is formulated within a coalition formation game framework to achieve both low computational complexity and automated decision-making in cluster formation. Additionally, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm (DCA) that incorporates three innovative operations for forming/breaking coalition, facilitating collaborative decision-making among individual intelligent vehicles. The convergence of the DCA is proven to result in a Nash stable partition, and extensive simulations demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches for coalition formation.</description>

      <title>Right Reward Right Time for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical learning periods (CLPs) in federated learning (FL) refer to early stages during which low-quality contributions (e.g., sparse training data availability) can permanently impair the learning performance of the global model owned by the model owner (i.e., the cloud server). However, strategies to motivate clients with high-quality contributions to join the FL training process and share trained model updates during CLPs remain underexplored. Additionally, existing incentive mechanisms in FL treat all training periods equally, which consequently fails to motivate clients to participate early. Compounding this challenge is the cloud's limited knowledge of client training capabilities due to privacy regulations, leading to information asymmetry. Therefore, in this article, we propose a time-aware incentive mechanism, called Right Reward Right Time (R3T), to encourage client involvement, especially during CLPs, to maximize the utility of the cloud in FL. Specifically, the cloud utility function captures the trade-off between the achieved model performance and payments allocated for clients' contributions, while accounting for clients' time and system capabilities, efforts, joining time, and rewards. Then, we analytically derive the optimal contract for the cloud and devise a CLP-aware mechanism to incentivize early participation and efforts while maximizing cloud utility, even under information asymmetry. By providing the right reward at the right time, our approach can attract the highest-quality contributions during CLPs. Simulation and proof-of-concept studies show that R3T increases cloud utility and is more economically effective than benchmarks. Notably, our proof-of-concept results show up to a 47.6% reduction in the total number of clients and up to a 300% improvement in convergence time while reaching competitive test accuracies compared with incentive mechanism benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Using "Failure Costs" to Guarantee Execution Quality in Competitive and Permissionless Order Flow Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of decentralized blockchains, accurately simulating the outcome of order flow auctions (OFAs) off-chain is challenging due to adversarial sequencing, encrypted bids, and frequent state changes. Existing approaches, such as deterministic sorting via consensus layer modifications (e.g., MEV taxes) (Robinson and White 2024) and BRAID (Resnick 2024) or atomic execution of aggregated bids (e.g., Atlas) (Watts et al. 2024), remain vulnerable in permissionless settings where limited throughput allows rational adversaries to submit "spoof" bids that block their competitors' access to execution. We propose a new failure cost penalty that applies only when a solution is executed but does not pay its bid or fulfill the order. Combined with an on-chain escrow system, this mechanism empowers applications to asynchronously issue their users a guaranteed minimum outcome before the execution results are finalized. It implies a direct link between blockchain throughput, censorship resistance, and the capital efficiency of auction participants (e.g., solvers), which intuitively extends to execution quality. At equilibrium, bids fully reflect the potential for price improvement between bid submission and execution, but only partially reflect the potential for price declines. This asymmetry unbounded upside for winning bids, limited downside for failed bids, and no loss for losing bids - ultimately benefits users.</description>
