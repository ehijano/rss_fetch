      <title>Caught in the Act: Observations of the Double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo During the Disappearance of a Pulsation Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New results on the behavior of the double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo are presented. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed this star again in 2022, and an observing campaign of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) was completed after the TESS observations as a follow-up. We find that the first overtone pulsation mode in this star completely disappears during the TESS observing window. This mode reappears at the end of the TESS observations, and the AAVSO observing campaign shows that in the months that followed, the first overtone mode was not only present, but was the dominant mode of pulsation. This star, and potentially others like it, could hold the key to finally solving the mystery of the Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae.</description>

      <title>Tidally distorted stars are triaxial pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars in close binaries are tidally distorted, and this has a strong effect on their pulsation modes. We compute the mode frequencies and geometries of tidally distorted stars using perturbation theory, accounting for the effects of the Coriolis force and the coupling between different azimuthal orders $m$ of a multiplet induced by the tidal distortion. For tidally coupled dipole pressure modes, the tidal coupling dominates over the Coriolis force and the resulting pulsations are ``triaxial", with each of the three modes in a multiplet ``tidally tilted" to be aligned with the one of the three principal axes of the star. The observed amplitudes and phases of the dipole modes aligned orthogonal to the spin axis are modulated throughout the orbit, producing doublets in the power spectrum that are spaced by exactly twice the orbital frequency. Quadrupole modes have similar but slightly more complex behavior. This amplitude modulation allows for mode identification which can potentially enable detailed asteroseismic analyses of tidally tilted pulsators. Pressure modes should exhibit this behavior in stellar binaries close enough to be tidally synchronized, while gravity modes should remain aligned with the star's spin axis. We discuss applications to various types of pulsating stars, and the relationship between tidal tilting of pulsations and the ``single-sided" pulsations sometimes observed in very tidally distorted stars.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous high-angular-resolution imaging of the AGB star W Hya in vibrationally excited H2O lines and visible polarized light with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and visible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W Hya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar radii. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at 268 and 251 GHz with ALMA at a spatial resolution of 16 x 20 mas and at 748 and 820 nm at a resolution of 26 x 27 mas with the VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. ALMA's high spatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally excited H2O line at 268 GHz (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 6_5,2 - 7_4,3) over the stellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected for thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and just outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii), extending to ~60 mas (~2.9 stellar radii). Another H2O line (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 9_2,8 - 8_3,5) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy was tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface. This suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHzH2O line is suprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O density are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line reveals global infall at up to ~15 km/s within 2--3 stellar radii, but outflows at up to ~8 km/s are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the visible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii) with a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in the east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible polarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely maser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the inhomogeneous atmosphere within ~2--3 stellar radii.</description>

      <title>The relation between the ADF and the ionized nebular mass in PNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the proposed relation between ADFs and ionized masses in planetary nebulae. For this, we have collected from the literature the ADFs and other parameters such as heliocentric distances, H$\beta$ luminosities, logarithmic reddening correction at H$\beta$, c(H$\beta$), electron densities and others and we calculated the ionized mass for a sample of 132 PNe, 27 of which possess a binary central star (14 are close binaries). In addition the distribution of these objects in the Galaxy is analyzed. The ionized masses were calculated considering two different electron densities, the one provided by the [S II] density sensitive lines ratio and the one provided by the [Cl III] lines ratio. No relation was found between ionized masses and ADFs for this sample, although it is confirmed than the PNe with the largest ADFs correspond in general to objects with a close binary central star, although it is important to say that about 20 percent of these objects have an ADF larger than 5 but smaller than 10. Therefore a PN having a close binary central star does not necessarily exhibit an extremely large ADF. We also have searched for possible relations between the ADFs and the stellar atmospheres, divided in H-rich and H-poor stars. No particular relation was found. Interestingly, several PNe with a [WR] H-poor CSPN present an ADF larger than 10, but so far they have not been reported as having a binary central star.</description>

      <title>Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode $\sigma_e \simeq 0.30$. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to $10^3$days (possibly extending to tens of AU).
  This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of $\sigma_e \simeq \sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_*}$. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.</description>

      <title>Temporal evolution of axially standing kink motions in solar coronal slabs: An eigenfunction expansion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to provide more insights into the applicability to solar coronal seismology of the much-studied discrete leaky modes (DLMs) in classic analyses. Under linear ideal pressureless MHD, we examine two-dimensional (2D) axial fundamental kink motions that arise when localized velocity exciters impact some symmetric slab equilibria. Continuous structuring is allowed for. A 1D initial value problem (IVP) is formulated in conjunction with an eigenvalue problem (EVP) for laterally open systems, with no strict boundary conditions (BCs) at infinity. The IVP is solved by eigenfunction expansion, allowing a clear distinction between the contributions from proper eigenmodes and improper continuum eigenmodes. Example solutions are offered for parameters typical of active region loops. Our solutions show that the system evolves towards long periodicities due to proper eigenmodes (of order the axial Alfven time), whereas the interference of the improper continuum may lead to short periodicities initially (of order the lateral Alfven time). Specializing to the slab axis, we demonstrate that the proper contribution strengthens with the density contrast, but may occasionally be stronger for less steep density profiles. Short periodicities are not guaranteed in the improper contribution, the details of the initial exciter being key. When identifiable, these periodicities tend to agree with the oscillation frequencies expected for DLMs, despite the differences in the BCs between our EVP and classic analyses. The eigenfunction expansion approach enables all qualitative features to be interpreted as the interplay between the initial exciter and some response function, the latter solely determined by the equilibria. Classic theories for DLMs can find seismological applications, with time-dependent studies offering additional ways for constraining initial exciters.</description>

      <title>Filament eruption deflection and associated CMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the observations of a quiescent filament eruption and its deflection from the radial direction. The event occurred in the southern solar hemisphere on 2021 May 9 and was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), by the STEREO A Observatory and GONG. Part of the filament erupted in the west direction, while major part of the filament deviated towards east direction. LASCO observed a very weak CME towards the west direction where it faded quickly. Moreover, the eruption was associated with CME observed by STEREO A COR1 and COR2. Our observations provide the evidence that the filament eruption was highly non-radial in nature.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Thermal Nonequilibrium Cycles in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.</description>

      <title>Strong magnetic fields of old white dwarfs are symmetric about the stellar rotation axes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many magnetic white dwarfs exhibit a polarised spectrum that periodically varies as the star rotates because the magnetic field is not symmetric about the rotation axis. In this work, we report the discovery that while weakly magnetic white dwarfs of all ages with M &lt; 1Mo show polarimetric variability with a period between hours and several days, the large majority of magnetic white dwarfs in the same mass range with cooling ages older than 2 Gyr and field strengths &gt; 10 MG show little or no polarimetric variability. This could be interpreted as extremely slow rotation, but a lack of known white dwarfs with measured periods longer than two weeks means that we do not see white dwarfs slowing their rotation. We therefore suggest a different interpretation: old strongly magnetic white dwarfs do not vary because their fields are roughly symmetric about the rotation axes. Symmetry may either be a consequence of field evolution or a physical characteristic intrinsic to the way strong fields are generated in older stars. Specifically, a strong magnetic field could distort the shape of a star, forcing the principal axis of maximum inertia away from the spin axis. Eventually, as a result of energy dissipation, the magnetic axis will align with the angular momentum axis. We also find that the higher-mass strongly magnetised white dwarfs, which are likely the products of the merging of two white dwarfs, may appear as either polarimetrically variable or constant. This may be the symptom of two different formation channels or the consequence of the fact that a dynamo operating during a merger may produce diverse magnetic configurations. Alternatively, the massive white dwarfs with constant polarisation may be rotating with periods much shorter than the typical exposure times of the observations.</description>

      <title>Self-Excited Pulsations and the Instability Strip of Long-Period Variables: the Transition from Small-Amplitude Red Giants to Semi-Regular Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic stellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of self-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with OGLE observations in the period-luminosity diagram we are able to link the transition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a shift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is critical for model-based studies of the period-luminosity relations of evolved stars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in particular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope composition. The grid of models is made publicly available with a companion interpolation routine.</description>

      <title>Forecast of solar activity based on mean-field dynamo model and neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a prediction of the solar activity on a short time-scale applying the method based on a combination of a nonlinear mean-field dynamo model and the artificial neural network. The artificial neural network which serves as a correction scheme for the forecast, uses the currently available observational data (e.g., the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers) and the dynamo model output. The nonlinear mean-field $\alpha\,\Omega$ dynamo produces the large-scale magnetic flux which is redistributed by negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) producing sunspots and active regions. The nonlinear mean-field dynamo model includes algebraic nonlinearity (caused by the feedback of the growing magnetic field on the plasma motion) and dynamic nonlinearities (related to the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of small-scale magnetic field). We compare the forecast errors with a horizon of 1, 6, 12 and 18 months, for different forecast methods, with the same corrections on the current monthly observations. Our forecast is in good agreement with the observed solar activity, the forecast error is almost stably small over short-medium ranges of forecasting windows. Despite a strong level of chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we present quantitative evidence that the solar activity on a short range can be stably well predicted, by the joint use of the physically based model with the neural network. This result may have an immediate practical implementation for predictions of various phenomena of solar activity and other astrophysical processes, so may be of interest to a broad community.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) correspond to the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (C-O WD) star in a binary system, triggered by the accretion of material from another star, or the merger/collision with a secondary WD. Their phenomenal luminosity -- several billion times that of the sun -- has motivated their use as cosmological distance indicators and led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. SNe Ia are also the main producers of iron and hence play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. While recent observations have confirmed the basic theoretical picture of an exploding C-O WD star whose luminosity is powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, a number of uncertainties remain concerning the nature of the binary companion and the explosion mechanism. Several lines of evidence point towards the existence of multiple progenitor channels in order to explain the full range of the observed diversity. A complete physical understanding of these energetic stellar explosions remains a long-lasting goal of modern astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ then combines the resulting individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized (via median selection) light curve. Additionally, the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ inflates the uncertainties of each time-series data point using information from the median absolute deviation between the individually detrended light curve, propagating information into the final detrended light curve about the added uncertainty due to the correctness of the underlying models.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Young Stellar Objects Under Various Stellar Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Gaia Data Release 3 and APOGEE datasets, we investigate the kinematic differences between young stellar objects (YSOs) and their parent clouds in five nearby star-forming regions. Overall, the 1D velocity differences between Class II YSOs and their parent molecular cloud range from [0, 1.4] km/s. In feedback environments dominated by outflows, massive stars, and supernova feedback, the corresponding velocity differences range from [0, 1.4] km/s, [0.1, 0.4] km/s, and [0.1, 1] km/s, respectively. These results indicate that YSO kinematics are not significantly affected by these different types of feedback environment. Additionally, compared to the Class II YSOs, Class III YSOs have slightly larger velocities and dispersions.</description>

      <title>Surface accretion as a dust retention mechanism in protoplanetary disks. I. Formulation and proof-of-concept simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of dust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.</description>

      <title>Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the dependence of shock heating rates on various disk and planetary parameters. Our results show that the shock heating rates are primarily influenced by the planet's mass and the disk's viscosity, while being insensitive to the thermal relaxation rate and the radial profiles of the disk's surface density and sound speed. We provide universal empirical formulas for the shock heating rates produced by the primary and secondary spiral arms as a function of orbital radius, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and planet-to-star mass ratio $q$. The obtained formulas are accurate within a factor of a few for a moderately viscous and adiabatic disk with a planet massive enough that its spiral arms are strongly nonlinear. Using these universal relations, we show that shock heating can overwhelm viscous heating when the disk viscosity is low ($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$) and the planet is massive ($q \gtrsim 10^{-3}$). Our empirical relations for the shock heating rates are simple and can be easily implemented into radially one-dimensional models of gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.
  Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.
  Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.
  Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>

      <title>Mass-loss, composition and observational signatures of stellar winds from X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-Ray bursts (XRBs) are powerful thermonuclear events on the surface of accreting neutron stars (NSs), which can synthesize intermediate-mass elements. Although the high surface gravity prevents an explosive ejection, a small fraction of the envelope may be ejected by radiation-driven winds. In our previous works, we have developed a non-relativistic radiative wind model and coupled it to an XRB hydrodynamic simulation. We now apply this technique to another model featuring consecutive bursts. We determine the mass-loss and chemical composition of the wind ejecta. Results show that, for a representative XRB, about $0.1\%$ of the envelope mass is ejected per burst, at an average rate of $3.9 \times 10^{-12}\,M_\odot \texttt{yr}^{-1}$. Between $66\%$ and $76\%$ of the ejecta composition is $^{60}$Ni, $^{64}$Zn, $^{68}$Ge, $^{4}$He and $^{58}$Ni. We also report on the evolution of observational quantities during the wind phase and simulate NICER observations that resemble those of 4U 1820-40.</description>

      <title>Tracing 3-D Magnetic Field Structure Using Dust Polarization and the Zeeman Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of magnetic fields within molecular clouds is fundamental to understanding star formation processes. Accurately gauging the three-dimensional structure of these fields presents a challenge, as observational techniques such as dust polarization and the Zeeman effect each provide only partial information on the orientation and line-of-sight strength, respectively. By analyzing a suite of AREPO simulations, this paper investigates how observables can relate to underlying physical properties to derive a more comprehensive picture of the magnetic field's inclination angle and strength, specifically in regions where both dust polarization and Zeeman data are available. To demonstrate the method, we produce synthetic observations of the polarization angle dispersion and line-of-sight Alfv\'en Mach Number and explore the behavior of the inclination angle, $\gamma$, and strength of the magnetic field in regions where both Zeeman and dust polarization data are available. We find that dust polarization data can be used to determine the inclination angle if the cloud is known to be trans-Alfv\'enic or sub-Alfv\'enic. The strength of the magnetic field relative to turbulence can be estimated by comparing polarization observations to Zeeman observations. Comparing the dispersion of the polarization angle to the estimated line-of-sight Alfv\'en Mach Number provides clues about the strength of the magnetic field and, consequently, the orientation of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional dynamical evolution of cloud particle microphysics in sub-stellar atmospheres I. Description and exploring Y-dwarf atmospheric variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in sub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance of new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with large-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to fully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the atmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability characteristics. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk microphysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres. We derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and develop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include homogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes that evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our new 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl clouds in a Tint = 400 K, log g = 4.25 Y-dwarf atmosphere and examine the effect of cloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics. Our results show a generally homogeneous global KCl cloud, with only slight variations occurring in the equatorial regions. The atmosphere is generally sluggish and stagnant, with near-zero vertical velocities throughout most of the atmosphere. Only very small grains ~0.01 um remain lofted in the atmosphere. Our results conform with dynamical theories for this parameter regime, with our model showing minimal (~0.2%) spectral variability at mid-infrared wavelengths. Our study demonstrates that the 2-moment bulk cloud microphysical scheme is a highly suitable method for investigating cloud characteristics and feedback in GCMs and other large scale simulations of sub-stellar atmospheres. Split moment schemes and mixed material grains will be explored in a follow up study.</description>

      <title>Compressible turbulent convection at very high Rayleigh numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transport in highly turbulent convection is not well understood. In this paper, we simulate compressible convection in a box of aspect ratio 4 using computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD finite difference method on single and multi-GPUs, and reach very high Rayleigh number ($\mathrm{Ra}$) -- $10^{15}$ in two dimensions and $10^{11}$ in three dimensions. We show that the Nusselt number $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.3}$ (classical scaling) that differs strongly from the ultimate-regime scaling, which is $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$. The bulk temperature drops adiabatically along the vertical even for high $\mathrm{Ra}$, which is in contrast to the constant bulk temperature in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection (RBC). Unlike RBC, the density decreases with height. In addition, the vertical pressure-gradient ($-dp/dz$) nearly matches the buoyancy term ($\rho g$). But, the difference, $-dp/dz-\rho g$, is equal to the nonlinear term that leads to Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>A Small Brown Dwarf in an Aligned Orbit around a Young, Fully-Convective M Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A star's spin-orbit angle can give us insight into a system's formation and dynamical history. In this paper, we use MAROON-X observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect to measure the projected obliquity of the LP 261-75 (also known as TOI-1779) system, focusing on the fully-convective M dwarf LP 261-75A and the transiting brown dwarf LP 261-75C. This is the first obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf orbiting an M dwarf and the seventh obliquity constraint of a brown dwarf overall. We measure a projected obliquity of $5^{+11}_{-10}$ degrees and a true obliquity of $14^{+8}_{-7}$ degrees for the system, meaning that the system is well-aligned and that the star is rotating very nearly edge-on, with an inclination of $90^o\,\pm\,11^o$. The system thus follows along with the trends observed in transiting brown dwarfs around hotter stars, which typically have low obliquities. The tendency for brown dwarfs to be aligned may point to some enhanced obliquity damping in brown dwarf systems, but there is also a possibility that the LP 261-75 system was simply formed aligned. In addition, we note that the brown dwarf's radius ($R_C\,=\,0.9$ R$_J$) is not consistent with the youth of the system or radius trends observed in other brown dwarfs, indicating that LP 261-75C may have an unusual formation history.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic origin of two dormant BH binaries: Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two systems, namely, Gaia~BH1 and Gaia~BH2, that have been confirmed as dormant (i.e., no X-ray emission detected) black hole (BH) - low-mass star binaries in the latest Gaia mission data release (DR3) are intriguing in the context of their formation and evolution. Both systems consist of $\sim9$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ BH and $\sim1$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ star orbiting each other on a wide, eccentric orbit ($e\sim 0.5$). We argue that formation of such Gaia~BH-like systems through the isolated binary evolution (IBE) channel, under the standard common envelope assumptions, and from dynamical interactions in young massive and open clusters are equally probable, and that the formation rate of such binaries is of the order of $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}$ for both channels. We estimate that, according to our models, there are at most $\sim900$ detectable Gaia~BH-like binaries in the Milky Way thin disc. What plays an important role in formation of Gaia~BH-like systems via the IBE channel is the mutual position of the natal kick velocity vector and the binary angular momentum vector. We find that natal kicks with a median magnitude of $\sim40$ km/s are preferred for the formation of Gaia~BH1-like binaries. Approximately $94\%$ of those binaries are formed with the BH spin misaligned to the orbital axis by less than $40^{\circ}$. Gaia~BH2-like binaries form if the low velocity natal kick (of median magnitude $\sim20$ km/s) is directed within $15^{\circ}$ about the orbital plane. In addition to natal kick, we also discuss the influence of tidal interaction and the adopted common envelope $\lambda_\mathrm{ce}$~parameter prescription on the evolution of Gaia~BH-like binaries. We follow the subsequent evolution of the binaries, once formed as Gaia~BH1 and Gaia~BH2 systems, to investigate their connection with the low-mass X-ray binary population.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the high-resolution spectroscopy of AW UMa and Epsilon CrA: Is the Lucy model valid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A re-examination of high-resolution spectral monitoring of the W UMa-type binaries AW UMa and Epsilon CrA casts doubt on the widely utilized Lucy (1968a, 1968b) model of contact binaries. The detection of the very faint profile of the secondary component in AW UMa leads to a new spectroscopic determination of the mass ratio, q(sp) = 0.092 +/- 0.007, which is close to the previous, medium-resolution spectroscopic result of Pribulla &amp; Rucinski (2008), q(sp) = 0.101 +/- 0.006, and remains substantially different from a cluster of generally accepted photometric results by several authors, concentrated around q(ph) = 0.080 +/- 0.005. The two approaches are independent, with the spectroscopic technique being more direct yet more demanding on telescope/spectrograph resources, while the photometric determinations are accessible to smaller telescopes but entirely dependent on the Lucy model. A survey of binaries with the best-determined values of the mass ratio shows a common tendency for q(ph) &lt; q(sp). The tendency for systematically smaller values of q(ph) may result from the overfilling of the primary lobe and underfilling of the secondary lobe relative to the Roche model geometry, as predicted by the Stepien (2009) model; the tendency may be variable in time. Despite the observed moderate inter-systemic velocities, the photometric Lucy model may remain useful in providing approximate, though biased, results for the mass ratio. A complicating factor in detailed spectral analysis may be the occurrence of Enhanced Spectral-line Perturbations (ESP) projected over the secondary profiles, appearing in different numbers in the two studied binaries. The ESPs are tentatively identified within the Stepien model as collision fronts or fountains of hot, primary-component gas from the circumbinary, energy-carrying flow.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of Galactic Cepheids from long-baseline interferometry V. High-accuracy orbital parallax and mass of SU Cygni</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cepheid masses are particularly necessary to help solving the mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes. We used CHARA/MIRC to measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from the HST. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provides the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, $M_A = 4.859\pm0.058M_\odot$, and its two companions, $M_{Ba} = 3.595 \pm 0.033 M_\odot$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.546 \pm 0.009 M_\odot$. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2%). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be $926.3 \pm 5.0$pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of $6\mu$as (0.5%), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\sim$ 2030) for single stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity and Thermal Hall Effect in Dense Electron-Ion Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$ or carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by the Righi--Leduc coefficient. The transition from a degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity. We provide also formulas fit to our numerical results, which can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of warm compact stars.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations), In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>
