Abstract: Since their domestication at the dawn of civilization, cats have been known for their uncanny ability to seemingly defy gravity. We conjecture that this innate ability of cats is real: uniquely in the animal kingdom, felis catus, possibly along with a few closely related species, are indeed capable of manipulating their passive gravitational mass. We explore this idea in the context of both general relativity and quantum physics. We reach the intriguing conclusion that a close study of the behavior of cats in a gravitational field might shed light not only on the mechanism of neutrino mass mixing but perhaps even on the most fundamental question in theoretical physics: a satisfactory unification of the theory of gravitation and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg Gravity: Geometry, Energy Conditions, and Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate traversable wormholes within the framework of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) nonlinear electrodynamics. By employing the Einstein field equations with quantum corrections from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, we derive wormhole solutions and examine their geometric, physical, and gravitational properties. Two redshift function models are analyzed: one with a constant redshift function and another with a radial-dependent function $\Phi=r_{0}/r$. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum corrections significantly influences the wormhole geometry, particularly by mitigating the need for exotic matter. The shape function and energy density are derived and examined in both models, revealing that the energy conditions, including the weak and null energy conditions (WEC and NEC), are generally violated at the wormhole throat. However, satisfaction of the strong energy condition (SEC) is observed, consistent with the nature of traversable wormholes. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass of the EEH wormhole is calculated, showing contributions from geometric, electromagnetic, and quantum corrections. The mass decreases with the Euler-Heisenberg correction parameter, indicating that quantum effects contribute significantly to the wormhole mass. Furthermore, we investigate gravitational lensing within the EEH wormhole geometry using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, revealing that the deflection angle is influenced by both the electric charge and the nonlinear parameter. The nonlinear electrodynamic corrections enhance the gravitational lensing effect, particularly at smaller impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Yano-Schr\"odinger Hyperfluid: Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect cosmological hyperfluids generalize the concept of a perfect fluid within the framework of metric affine gravity. These hyperfluids encode the microstructure of matter including shear, dilation, and spin via the hypermomentum tensor. In this paper, we focus on the observational constraints of the recently introduced Yano-Schr\"odinger hyperfluid, which sources a special type of nonmetricity that preserves the lengths of vectors under autoparallel transport. We propose a model in which the effective nonmetricity contributions to pressure and matter density are related linearly as $p_{\text{eff}} = \omega \rho_{\text{eff}}$. This assumption allows for a straightforward parameterization of deviations from standard cosmological behavior while maintaining analytical tractability. To constrain the effective equation of state parameter $\omega$, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 and the Dark Energy Survey Year 6, along with Type Ia supernova and Cosmic Chronometer data. In our analysis, we treat $r_d$ as a free parameter, enabling late-time data to extract posterior distributions for the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the sound horizon ($r_d$), along with the corresponding model parameters. Our results yield $H_0 = 66.9 \pm 1.6$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $r_d = 147.7 \pm 3.5$ Mpc, with $\omega = -0.476$. Finally, we employ various statistical metrics to compare different Yano-Schr\"odinger models against the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the LESC model provides a better fit to the data, suggesting that modifications to metric-affine gravity could offer viable alternatives to the standard cosmological paradigm.</description>

      <title>Slow-roll Natural &amp; Hilltop Inflation in Rastall Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a concise analysis of inflation under Rastall gravity by examining three types of potential such as the power law, natural, and hilltop potentials. Choosing a minimal interaction between matter and gravity, we derived the modified slow-roll parameters, the scalar spectral index $(n_s)$, the tensor spectral index $(n_T)$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $(r)$. For a general power-law potential as well as for Natural &amp; Hilltop inflation, we calculated these quantities and subsequently plotted their trajectories in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. For the power-law potential, only the cases $n = 2/3$ and $n = 1$ satisfy the observational constraint of the Planck 2018 data. The natural potential analysis shows that the mass scale is crucial, with better compatibility achieved at $f = 5M_{p}$ compared to $f = 10M_{p}$. Lastly, the Hilltop potential results indicate that among the cases studied $m = 3/2, 2, 3$, and $4$, only $m = 3/2$ exhibits marginal consistency with observational bounds, while the other cases fail to produce acceptable $(n_s - r)$ trajectories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Waveform Modeling for High-SNR Gravitational-Wave Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-analytical waveform models for black hole binaries require calibration against numerical relativity waveforms to accurately represent the late inspiral and merger, where analytical approximations fail. After the fitting coefficients contained in the model are optimized, they are typically held fixed when the model is used to infer astrophysical parameters from real gravitational-wave data. Though point estimates for the fitting parameters are adequate for most applications, they provide an incomplete description of the fit, as they do not account for either the quality of the fit or the intrinsic uncertainties in the numerical relativity data. Using the IMRPhenomD model, we illustrate how to propagate these uncertainties into the inference by sampling the fitting coefficients from a prior distribution and marginalizing over them. The prior distribution is constructed by ensuring that the model is compatible with a training set of numerical relativity surrogates, within a predefined mismatch threshold. This approach demonstrates a pathway to mitigate systematic bias in high signal-to-noise events, particularly when envisioned for the next generation of semi-analytical models.</description>

      <title>Bound-Unbound Universality and the All-Order Semi-Classical Wave Function in Schwarzschild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for analytically computing time-dependent observables for a relativistic probe particle in Coulomb and Schwarzschild backgrounds. The method generates expressions valid both in the bound and unbound regimes, namely bound-unbound universal expressions. To demonstrate our method we compute the time-dependent radius and azimuthal angle for relativistic motion in a Coulomb background (relativistic Keplerian motion), as well as the electromagnetic field radiated by a relativistic Keplerian source. All of our calculations exhibit bound-unbound universality. Finally, we present an exact expression for the semi-classical wave function in Schwarzschild. The latter is crucial in applying our method to any time-dependent observable for probe-limit motion in Schwarzschild, to any desired order in velocity and the gravitational constant $G$.</description>

      <title>Detectability of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can amplify ultralight bosonic fields through superradiance, forming macroscopic clouds known as gravitational atoms. When the cloud forms around one of the components of a binary system, it can undergo a series of distinctive interactions, comprising both secular effects, such as dynamical friction or accretion, and resonant behaviour. These processes are expected to leave a distinctive signature on the gravitational waveform emitted by the binary, whose detectability we investigate in this paper. To do so, we implement a numerical code that integrates these effects, computed within a Newtonian approximation, for intermediate-to-high mass-ratio binaries on circular equatorial orbits. Realistic waveforms incorporating these environmental influences are generated and analyzed using the Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the detectability of bosonic clouds with current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories. Our results demonstrate the potential for gravitational wave astronomy to probe the existence and properties of ultralight bosons.</description>

      <title>Impact of Lorentz violation on Radiative transition of an atom falling into spherically symmetric black hole and related BHAR entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intriguing phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by an atom falling into a black hole. Our investigation focuses on examining the impact of Lorentz violation within the framework of the bumblebee gravity model on this phenomenon. We observe that the excitation probability although acquires Planck-like factor the exponential part of it acquires the Lorentz violation factor that shows a clear indication of violation of equivalence principle and it is rooted to Lorentz violation conformal symmetry has nothing to do with it. Then we calculate the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for this black hole geometry. We observed that the HBAR entropy has the form similar to that of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy however it has been observed that it is also influenced by Lorentz violation aspect of Bumblebee theory. We also study the prospect of equivalence principle in this Lorentz violation background. by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector. Transition probabilities depend both on conformal symmetry and Lorentz violation effect.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a dyonic black hole in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes of a non-rotating dyonic black hole within the framework of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg theory. We present a detailed analysis focuses on understanding the influence of dyonic charges on the oscillatory properties of these BHs. The quasinormal modes are calculated to explore the interplay between the dyonic charge and the characteristic frequencies of perturbations. The results are then systematically compared with those of black holes possessing purely electric or purely magnetic charges in the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg framework. This comparison highlights the unique signatures and dynamic behavior introduced by the presence of dyonic charges, offering deeper insights into the properties of black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and its Free-fall Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory(ECT), in which the weak equivalence principle is violated by the spin-gravitational interaction. We derive the general equation of geodesic in terms of comoving tetrads. More concretely, we consider the case of the quadratic form of the lagrangian, within the environment of weak and static spherically symmetric space-time. We find that the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash Papapetrou equation, which is due to the coupling of the spin of the test particle to the torsion field of the environment. This allows us to test the theory with free-fall experiment in the laboratory, such as atom interferometer. By using the previous data, we find the upper bound of the possible torsion field on Earth is given by up to $2.0\times 10^{1} \mathrm{~m^{-1}}$ and torsion gradient up to $3.1 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{~m^{-2}}$. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth force.</description>

      <title>Generic linearized curvature singularity at the perturbed Kerr Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the precise asymptotics of the spin $-2$ Teukolsky field in the interior and along the Cauchy horizon of a subextremal Kerr black hole. Together with the oscillatory blow-up asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field proven in our previous work arXiv:2409.02670, our result suggests that generic perturbations of a Kerr black hole build up to form a coordinate-independent curvature singularity at the Cauchy horizon. This supports the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in Kerr spacetimes. Unlike in the spin $+2$ case, the spin $-2$ Teukolsky field is regular on the Cauchy horizon and the first term in its asymptotic development vanishes. As a result, the derivation of a precise lower bound for the spin $-2$ field is more delicate than in the spin $+2$ case, and relies on a novel ODE method based on a decomposition of the Teukolsky operator between radial and time derivatives.</description>

      <title>Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. The initial boundary value problem for a family of null hypersurfaces is specified for a timelike-null foliation at the central geodesic of spherical symmetry as well as for a double-null foliation where the corresponding boundary is a null hypersurface. For the latter, two distinct boundary value formulations arise -- one where the null boundary has zero Misner-Sharp mass and another one where the corresponding Misner-Sharp mass is nonzero. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution are derived.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach in the generalized Chaplygin gas model in higher dimensional space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we have presented a higher-dimensional cosmological model with a generalized Chaplygin-type gas to explain the recent acceleration of the universe. Dimensional reduction is feasible in this model, and our solutions are general, as they recover all known results of $4D$ Chaplygin-driven cosmology when $d =0$. Using Hubble-$57$ data obtained through the differential age method (DA), the best fit curves are drawn and estimated observational constraints of the model parameters. A note worthy aspect of the model is that the resulting field equation is highly nonlinear with respect to the scale factor. This nonlinearity allows us to describe both dust-dominated and accelerating universes, though only in extremal cases. We obtain solutions of the non-linear field equations which are new and interesting. We have adopted a first-order approximation of the key equation, which enabled us to derive an exact, time-dependent solution for the scale factor. The higher dimensional cosmological model is found to converge to a $\Lambda$CDM model for a large-scale factor, capturing the desired feature of an acceleration flip. We also explore the evolution of the deceleration parameter, effective EoS, jerk parameter, etc., both analytically and graphically. The Chaplygin gas parameter $\alpha$ being significantly less than unity, apparently the present model does not support pure Chaplygin gas model ($\alpha = 1$). However, the lower value is consistent with our analysis, suggesting that smaller values of $\alpha$ are expected at the later stage of the universe.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24263</link>

Abstract: According to conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC), the currently conventional description of the entire history of the universe (but without an initial inflationary phase) provides but one cosmic aeon of an unending sequence of such aeons, where the future conformal infinity of each aeon joins essentially smoothly to the conformally stretched big bang of the next, across a spacelike 3-surface, referred to as a crossover 3-surface. Whereas in previous accounts of CCC a detailed description of the physics of crossover had been somewhat problematic, a novel idea is introduced here to show how crossover takes place naturally during a temporal period of the universe that is dominated by gravitational waves referred to here as a gravitational wave epoch (GWE). Accordingly, the geometry at the crossover surface is conformally smooth, except at a discrete set of points, referred to as Hawking points, each representing the final Hawking evaporation of the dominant black hole of a galactic cluster in the earlier aeon. It is shown here (using 2-spinor and twistor techniques) that there is a mass-energy conservation law that holds across the crossover surface, showing that the rise of temperature within such Hawking spots should be effectively determined by the total mass of the pre-crossover galactic cluster involved. This rise of temperature on the CMB map within Hawking spots is found to be in quantitative agreement with the masses of the largest galactic clusters observed in our own aeon what suggests that the physics in the previous aeon was, at least in the gravitational sector, similar to ours. A second observational feature, the actual angular diameter of the Hawking spots seen in our CMB, which is about twice what should have been expected, is associated to the presence of GWE just after the crossover and before the start of the usual cosmological epochs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational instantons with a self-dual Hermitian structure and a non-zero self-dual Weyl tensor have a quasi-locally conserved charge associated to spin-lowering via Killing spinors, and corresponding to a parameter of the moduli space. For any asymptotic structure (e.g. AF/ALF, ALE, compact), we prove that infinitesimal Einstein deformations admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation to this charge. In the ALF and compact cases, we furthermore prove that a curve of metrics in the moduli space passing through the background instanton is conformally K\"ahler to second perturbative order.</description>

      <title>Modified cosmology though spacetime thermodynamics and generalized mass-to-horizon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach for the case of generalized mass-to-horizon entropy, which is a two-parameter extension of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy that arises from the extended mass-to-horizon relation, that is in turn required in order to have consistency with the Clausius relation. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the novel terms. We derive analytical solutions for the dark energy density parameter, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, and the deceleration parameter, and we show that the Universe exhibits the usual thermal history with the succession of matter and dark energy epochs. Additionally, depending on the value of the entropy parameters, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter can either lie in the phantom regime at high redshifts entering into the quintessence regime at small redshifts, or it can lie in the quintessence regime at high redshifts and experience the phantom-divide crossing at small redshifts, while in the far future in all cases it asymptotically obtains the cosmological constant value $-1$. Finally, we perform observational confrontation with Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) datasets, showing that the scenario is in agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Greybody Factor in AdS Black Brane Spectroscopy: A Study with Scalar and Electromagnetic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the greybody factor for scalar and photon radiations in AdS Schwarzschild black brane. We consider the linearized field equations satisfied by the minimally coupled massive scalar field and the transverse components of the Maxwell fields on the black brane background and recast them to the Heun's equations by appropriate change of variables and field redefinitions. At the asymptotic region, we consider appropriate linear combinations of the normalizable and non-normalizable solutions of the field equations to construct in/outgoing modes. We consider the ingoing solutions near horizon to construct the IN state and compute the coefficients of the in- and outgoing modes of the asymptotic solutions in terms of the connection coefficients of the Heun functions. Finally by calculating ratio of the coefficient of outgoing modes to the ingoing modes we find an exact expression for the greybody factor. We find that the greybody factor for the transverse Maxwell fields and that for the scalars dual to the conformal scalar primaries with odd integer scaling dimensions vanish off.</description>

      <title>Motions of Test Particles in Gravitational Field, Perturbations and Greybody Factor of Bardeen-like AdS Black Hole with Phantom Global Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of test particles, perturbations, and greybody factors within the framework of a Bardeen-like AdS black hole (BH) with a phantom global monopole. This study explores the interactions between nonlinear electrodynamics, the energy scale of symmetry breaking, and space-time topology. We analyze the geodesic motion of null and time-like particles, deriving effective potentials that describe their trajectories. Utilizing the Regge-Wheeler potential, we calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, applying the sixth-order WKB approximation. Our findings highlight how the Bardeen-like parameter ($\mathrm{b}$) and the energy scale of symmetry breaking, characterized by the parameter ($\eta$), influence the QNM spectra, with potential implications for gravitational wave observations. We also examine greybody factors, focusing on the transmission and reflection coefficients for scalar and axial fields, and employ semi-analytic techniques to derive precise bounds. Furthermore, we assess the thermodynamic stability of the BH, emphasizing the role of these parameters in phase transitions and stability criteria.</description>

      <title>Sub-parsec precision measurement of pulsar distances with nanohertz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent evidence of nanohertz (nHz) gravitational wave (GW) background by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has sparked considerable interest in understanding its astrophysical origins, particularly regarding supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we focus on individual SMBHBs that will be hopefully detected in upcoming PTA observations. The effect of nHz GWs on the pulse arriving times is in general decomposed as a pulsar term and an Earth term, where the pulsar term encodes the pulsar-Earth distance as a phase shift relative to the Earth term, but is usually treated as an extra noise source since the pulsar distance is in general not well measured with uncertainty larger than the wavelength of nHz GWs. We propose that the pulsar distance could be constrained by combining the phase information of multiple SMBHBs that are individually resolved. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, we demonstrate that the pulsar distances can be measured to better than $0.4$ pc (1 pc) for pulsars at $D\sim 1$ kpc ($\sim 2.2$ kpc) with 30 years of observations by a 20-pulsar PTA with a noise level of $\sigma_{\rm n}=20$ ns in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the big data era of Astrophysics, the improvement of visualization techniques can greatly enhance the ability to identify and interpret key features in complex datasets. This aspect of data analysis will become even more relevant in the near future, with the expected growth of data volumes. With our studies, we aim to drive progress in this field and inspire further research. We present the second release of pastamarkers, a Python-based matplotlib package that we initially presented last year. In this new release we focus on big data visualization and update the content of our first release. We find that analyzing complex problems and mining large data sets becomes significantly more intuitive and engaging when using the familiar and appetizing colors of pasta sauces instead of traditional colormaps.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures and decoherence during inflation from deep subhorizon perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to shed light on the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial perturbations in single field inflation, we investigate the decoherence and associated quantum corrections to the correlation functions of superhorizon scalar curvature perturbations. The latter are considered as an open quantum system which undergoes quantum decoherence induced by a time-dependent environment of deep subhorizon tensorial modes through the trilinear interactions predicted by General Relativity. We first prove that, in full generality, a time dependent subhorizon environment can be relevant for decoherence during inflation, by considering derivativeless interactions, which, in our case, give the most important results. For the first time, the time dependence of the environment is properly taken into account by modifying the quantum master equation. Important non-Markovian effects pop up, instead, when dealing with derivative interactions. We adopt a possible way to treat them which has been recently proposed and seems well suited for our case. Our results show that when considering the interplay between derivativeless and derivative interactions, decoherence is slowed down. This underlines the importance of accounting for all the interactions in open quantum-system calculations in an inflationary setting. We finally compute the quantum corrections to cosmological correlation functions, by solving the transport equations induced by the quantum master equation. We also compare the results to the solutions obtained by an alternative method previously used in the literature. We observe a resummation of the quantum corrections to the power-spectrum, which is a general property of quantum master equations. We extend these results to the bispectrum, showing a decay of this correlation function in time which is analogous to the one found, previously, for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Interacting Dark Energy from DESI DR2 BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In its second data release (DR2), the \textit{Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument} (DESI) publicly released measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from over 13.1 million galaxies and 1.6 million quasars, covering the redshift range $0.295 \leq z \leq 2.330$. In this work, we investigate the impact of this new dataset on dark sector interaction models, which are motivated by non-gravitational interactions between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), commonly referred to as interacting dark energy models (IDE). We focus on two frameworks: the traditional IDE model and the recently proposed sign-switching Interacting model (S-IDE), aiming to derive new and robust constraints on both scenarios. After carefully selecting the sample for the joint analysis, ensuring compatibility among the data without significant tension, our main results indicate that both models can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, reducing it to moderate tension approximately $2.7\sigma$. The IDE model shows compatibility with the latest $S_8$ constraints from cosmic shear surveys, while the S-IDE model predicts lower values of $S_8$, which align with alternative perspectives on the $S_8$ tension. For the traditional IDE model, we derive new bounds for the coupling parameter, marking the strongest constraints to date through geometric measurements. This highlights the crucial role that supernova samples can play in refining these constraints. For the S-IDE model, we find mild evidence (approximately $2\sigma$) for the coupling parameter, suggesting a potential interaction between DE and DM.</description>

      <title>Genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality in the curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Bell nonlocality plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this paper, we first obtain the quantitative analytical expression of the genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality of any 4-qubit quantum state. Then, we investigate and derive the genuine four-partite nonlocalities in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole and the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In the Schwarzschild black hole, it is shown that the Hawking effect destroys the accessible genuine four-partite nonlocality while simultaneously having both detrimental and beneficial impacts on the inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality. Besides, we observe that the Hawking effect can generate the physically inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality for fermion fields in Schwarzschild black hole. This result shows that the genuine four-partite nonlocality can pass through the event horizon of black hole. Moreover, we also investigate the influence of the Hawking effect of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime on the genuine four-partite nonlocality of massless Dirac fields.</description>

Abstract: It has been shown that double field theory (DFT) action can be constructed in a perturbative manner up to cubic order by using double copy of Yang-Mills. This construction can also be extended by starting with higher-derivative Yang-Mills theory to obtain higher-derivative DFT action. In this work, I try to use this classical double copy formulation for Abelian subsector of heterotic DFT, starting with a Yang-Mills theory including a charged scalar field, namely (Y M + \phi^3) theory. Although the methods I used cannot give an exact match, they give some promising results.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of microlensing to show that observations of binary systems, such as those made by {\it Gaia}, combined with follow-up weak lensing measurements, can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly clumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially cover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to black holes with bosonic configurations around them, known as hair. Assuming that light can freely propagate through the halo of the exotic matter, the companion star will produce characteristic, sizable lensing signatures due to the deviation from a central gravitational potential. The signature of the multiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun of such structures. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\it Gaia} survey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental fields interacting gravitationally with baryons.</description>

      <title>Hint of $r\simeq 0.01$ after DESI DR2 ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the report by BICEP and Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}&lt;0.036$ (95\% C.L.) and $ &lt;1.3\sigma$ non-zero (with pre-DESI BAO data). However, recent datasets have significantly shifted the bestfit values of relevant $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters, and thus possibly alter the amplitude of lensing B-mode spectrum, which would affect the search for $r$. Here, the joint analysis of Planck and BICEP/Keck data with DESI DR2 reveals that the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $2.0\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ non-zero for PantheonPlus and DES-Y5, respectively, and the bestfit $r$ is $r_{0.05}\simeq 0.01$. The results are consistent with those with DESI DR1, but slightly strengthened. There might be still systematic uncertainties in B-mode measurements due to the foreground contamination, however, our work is to not say what about the value of $r$, but emphasize that the detection for $r$ is model-dependent and depends potentially on our insight into the dark universe, highlighting the important role of cosmological surveys in comprehending our very early universe.</description>

Abstract: We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.</description>

      <title>Non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes excited by tidal resonances in binary neutron stars</title>

Abstract: During the last seconds of a binary neutron-star merger, the tidal force can excite stellar oscillation modes to large amplitudes. From the perspective of premerger electromagnetic emissions and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, gravity ($g-$) modes constitute a propitious class. However, existing estimates for their impact employ linear schemes which may be inaccurate for large amplitudes, as achieved by tidal resonances. With rotation, inertial modes can be excited as well and while their non-linear saturation has been studied, an extension to fully-consistent gravito-inertial modes, especially in the neutron-star context, is an open problem. We study the linear and non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes and investigate the astrophysical consequences for binary neutron-star mergers, including the possibility of resonance-induced dynamo activity. A new (non-)linear formulation based on the separation of equilibrium and dynamical tides is developed. Implementing this into the 3D pseudo-spectral code MagIC, a suite of non-linear simulations of tidally-excited flows with an entropy/composition gradient in a stably-stratified Boussinesq spherical-shell are carried out. The new formulation accurately reproduces results of linear calculations for gravito-inertial modes with a free surface for low frequencies. For a constant-density cavity, we show that the axisymmetric differential rotation induced by nonlinear $_2g$ and $_1g$ modes may theoretically be large enough to amplify an ambient magnetic field to $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ G. In addition, rich non-linear dynamics are observed in the form of a parametric instability for the $_1g$ mode. The stars are also spun-up, which extends the resonance window for any given mode.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cutting out an infinite tube around $r=0$ formally removes the Schwarzschild singularity, but without a physical mechanism this procedure seems ad hoc and artificial. In this paper we provide justification for such a mechanism by means of non-locality. Motivated by the Gauss law we define a suitable radius variable as the inverse of a regular non-local potential, and use this variable to model a non-singular black hole. The resulting geometry has a de\,Sitter core, and for generic values of the regulator there is \emph{no inner horizon}, saving this model from potential issues via mass inflation. An \emph{outer} horizon only exists for masses above a critical threshold, thereby reproducing the conjectured ``mass gap'' for black holes in non-local theories. The geometry's density and pressure terms decrease exponentially, thereby rendering it an almost-exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations outside of astrophysical black holes. Its thermodynamic properties resemble that of the Hayward black hole, with the notable exception that for critical mass the horizon radius is zero.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) in scalar-tensor theories of gravitation with the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization can develop significant deviations from general relativity. Cases with a massless scalar were studied widely. Here we compare the NS scalarizations in the Damour--Esposito-Far{\`e}se theory, the Mendes-Ortiz theory, and the $\xi$-theory with a massive scalar field. Numerical solutions for slowly rotating NSs are obtained. They are used to construct the X-ray pulse profiles of a pair of extended hot spots on the surface of NSs. We also calculate the tidal deformability for NSs with spontaneous scalarization which is done for the first time with a massive scalar field. We show the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability. The X-ray pulse profiles, the tidal deformability, and the universal relation may help to constrain the massive scalar-tensor theories in X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of NSs, including the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) satellite, Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, and LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA laser interferometers.</description>

      <title>The M\"obius game and other Bell tests for relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive multiparty games that, if the winning chance exceeds a certain limit, prove the incompatibility of the parties' causal relations with any partial order. This, in turn, means that the parties exert a back-action on the causal relations; the causal relations are dynamical. The games turn out to be representable by directed graphs, for instance by an orientation of the M\"obius ladder. We discuss these games as device-independent tests of spacetime's dynamical nature in general relativity. To do so, we design relativistic settings where, in the Minkowski spacetime, the winning chance is bound to the limits. In contrast, we find otherwise tame processes with classical control of causal order that win the games deterministically. These suggest a violation of the bounds in gravitational implementations. We obtain these games by uncovering a "pairwise central symmetry" of the correlations in question. This symmetry allows us to recycle the facets of the acyclic subgraph polytope studied by Gr\"otschel, J\"unger, and Reinelt in the mid-80s for combinatorial optimization. In addition, we derive multiparty games in a scenario where the polytope dimension grows only linearly in the number of parties. Here, exceeding the limits not only proves the dynamical nature of the causal relations, but also that the correlations are incompatible with any global causal order.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the $R$ and $R^2$ invariants from torsion fluctuations on maximally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the runnings of the $R$ and $R^2$ operators that stem from integrating out quantum torsion fluctuations on a maximally symmetric Euclidean background, while treating the metric as a classical field. Our analysis is performed in a manifestly covariant way, exploiting both the recently-introduced spin-parity decomposition of torsion perturbations and the heat kernel technique. The Lagrangian we start with is the most general one for 1-loop computations on maximally symmetric backgrounds involving kinetic terms and couplings to the scalar curvature that is compatible with a gauge-like symmetry for the torsion. The latter removes the twice-longitudinal vector mode from the spectrum, and it yields operators of maximum rank four. We also examine the conditions required to avoid ghost instabilities and ensure the validity of our assumption to neglect metric quantum fluctuations, demonstrating the compatibility between these two assumptions. Then, we use our findings in the context of Starobinsky's inflation to calculate the contributions from the torsion tensor to the $\beta$-function of the $R^2$ term. While this result is quantitatively reliable only at the $0$-th order in the slow-roll parameters or during the very early stages of inflation -- due to the background choice -- it qualitatively illustrates how to incorporate quantum effects of torsion in the path integral formalism.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing of a five-dimensional charged, equally rotating black hole with a cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the lensing phenomena of the strong gravity regime of five-dimensional charged, equally rotating black holes with a cosmological constant, familiarly known as the Cveti\v c-L\"u-Pope black holes. These black holes are characterized by three observable parameters, the mass $M$, the charge $Q$ and the angular momentum $J$, in addition to the cosmological constant. We investigate the strong gravitational lensing observables, mainly the photon sphere radius, the minimum impact parameter, the deflection angle, the angular size, and the magnification of the relativistic images. We model the $M87$ and $SgrA^*$ for these observables. We also focus on the relativistic time delay effect in the strong-field regime of gravity and the impact of the observable on it. The analytical expressions for the observables of the relativistic images with vanishing angular momentum ($j=0$) are discussed in some detail. We shed a light on the gravitational time delay effect by incorporating the lensing observables. The gravitational time delay has a direct consequence on the photon sphere radius and hence on the quasinormal modes.</description>

Abstract: We uncover the solution space of a five dimensional geometry which we deem it as the direct counterpart of the Bianchi Type V cosmological model. We kinematically reduce the scale factor matrix and then, with an appropriate scaling and choice of time, we cast the spatial equations into a simple "Kasner" like form; thus revealing linear integrals of motion. Their number is enough so that, along with the quadratic constraint, it suffices to scan the entire space of solutions. The latter is revealed to be quite rich, containing cosmological solutions, some of which admit dimensional reduction asymptotically to four dimensions, Kundt spacetimes with vanishing type I (polynomial) curvature scalars and solutions describing periodic universes which behave like cosmological time crystals.</description>

      <title>Neural post-Einsteinian framework for efficient theory-agnostic tests of general relativity with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework and its variants are widely used to probe gravity through gravitational-wave tests that apply to a large class of theories beyond general relativity. However, the ppE framework is not truly theory-agnostic as it only captures certain types of deviations from general relativity: those that admit a post-Newtonian series representation in the inspiral of coalescing compact objects. Moreover, each type of deviation in the ppE framework has to be tested separately, making the whole process computationally inefficient and expensive, possibly obscuring the theoretical interpretation of potential deviations that could be detected in the future. We here present the neural post-Einsteinian (npE) framework, an extension of the ppE formalism that overcomes the above weaknesses using deep-learning neural networks. The core of the npE framework is a variational autoencoder that maps the discrete ppE theories into a continuous latent space in a well-organized manner. This design enables the npE framework to test many theories simultaneously and to select the theory that best describes the observation in a single parameter estimation run. The smooth extension of the ppE parametrization also allows for more general types of deviations to be searched for with the npE model. We showcase the application of the new npE framework to future tests of general relativity with the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. In particular, the npE framework is demonstrated to efficiently explore modifications to general relativity beyond what can be mapped by the ppE framework, including modifications coming from higher-order curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high post-Newtonian order, and dark-photon interactions in possibly hidden sectors of matter that do not admit a post-Newtonian representation.</description>

Abstract: In physical science, the concept of \emph{emergence} is often used to describe phenomena that occur at macroscopic scales but not at microscopic scales. The latter is usually referred to as a \emph{fundamental property} and the former as an \emph{emergent property}. In this paper, noncommutative geometry, often viewed as an offshoot of string theory, is the primary fundamental theory that gives rise to macroscopic wormholes and their properties, thereby becoming an emergent phenomenon. As a consequence of these considerations, we will reexamine the boundary conditions that characterize a Morris-Thorne wormhole. The result is a significant modification of the wormhole structure.</description>

Abstract: This study delves into the fundamental properties of graphene and boron nitride (BN) nanostructures, exploring their torsional energy characteristics within the framework of Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR). By constructing nanocones with disclination defects in these materials, we investigate the linear dependence of torsional energy on the disclination angle, as predicted by TEGR. The qualitative validation of TEGR's energy expression is supported by our simulations, which show a strong correlation between the torsional energy and the disclination angle, consistent with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose a quantitative analysis by estimating the coupling constant $k$ associated with TEGR through molecular simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Our results suggest that $k$ reflects the interatomic forces within the materials, providing insights into the nature of spacetime and gravitational interactions on a microscopic scale. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of material physics but also offer implications for the precision and validity of TEGR in describing gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: Extreme mass-ratio limit and final memory offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect is a strong-field relativistic phenomenon that is associated with a persistent change in the GW strain after the passage of a GW. The nonlinear effect arises from interactions of GWs themselves in the wave zone and is an observable effect connected to the infrared properties of general relativity. The detection of the GW memory effect is possible with LIGO and Virgo in a population of binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers or from individual events with next-generation ground- and space-based GW detectors or pulsar timing arrays. Matched-filtering-based searches for the GW memory require accurate, and preferably rapid-to-evaluate waveform models of the memory effect's GW signal. One important element of such a waveform model is a model for the final memory offset -- namely, the net change in strain between early and late times. In this paper, we construct a model for the final memory offset from the merger of nonspinning BBH systems in quasicircular orbits. A novel ingredient of this model is that we first compute the memory signal for extreme mass-ratio inspirals using a high post-Newtonian-order analytic calculation, and we use this analytical result to fix the coefficient in the fit which is linear in the mass-ratio. The resulting memory-offset fit could be used for detecting the GW memory for binaries that merge on a timescale that is short relative to the inverse of the low-frequency cutoff of a GW detector. Additionally, this fit will be useful for analytic waveform models of the GW memory signals in the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Regular Kerr black holes: Junction conditions and the matter content across the ring</title>

Abstract: Regular rotating black holes are usually described by a metric of the Kerr-Schild form with a particular mass function that is chosen to avoid the ring singularity of the Kerr metric and which approaches the Kerr metric at the asymptotic limit. However, as is well known, even for a class of well-behaved mass functions, the curvature scalars present a discontinuity in the equatorial plane at the ring. This discontinuity has been associated with the presence of a string of matter that joins the interior and exterior regions along the equatorial plane. By using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, we analyze all four possible combinations of the normal vector orientations on each side of the ring, construct the complete stress-energy momentum tensor of the string, and interpret each resulting solution. We show that, out of the four possibilities, only one of the four models for the string solution at the ring yields the appropriate asymptotic geometry. In such a case, the string bears a fluid with nonzero pressure, but with a vanishing line energy density, and it does not rotate at all. Finally, taking an appropriate metric for the exterior region, we also discuss a different scenario in which the matter source at the ring is a rotating lightlike fluid.</description>

      <title>Forward Ray Tracing and Hot Spots in Kerr Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hotspots, often characterized as pointlike emissions, frequently appear near black holes with significantly enhanced luminosity compared to the surrounding accretion flow. Notably, such hotspots are regularly observed near the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Light rays emitted from these sources follow complex trajectories around the black hole before reaching distinct locations on the observer's image plane. Precisely resolving both direct emissions and their higher-order images--despite the latter's intensity suppression--is essential for extracting detailed spacetime information, including the black hole's mass, spin, and inclination angle. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of hotspot modeling, we develop a forward ray tracing method based on the analytic integral solution of Kerr geodesics, leveraging conserved quantities. Our approach traces geodesics from a given emission point near the black hole to a distant observer, effectively capturing multiple images with a tailored parametrization scheme for root-finding. By perturbing these geodesics, we map finite-size emissions to distinct regions on the image plane, enabling the quantification of image shapes and amplification rates. This method not only enhances the identification of strongly lensed photons from black holes but also enables efficient spacetime tomography and hotspot localization, leveraging observations from the Event Horizon Telescope and its upcoming next-generation upgrades.</description>

      <title>Which is which? Identification of the two compact objects in gravitational-wave binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact objects observed in gravitational-wave astronomy so far always come in pairs and never individually. Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e., which is object "1" and which is object "2") effectively acts as systematics, or, equivalently an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis. We show that object identification can instead be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering -- a flavor of semi-supervised machine learning -- and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e. black hole vs. neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e. they might have been attributed to the other compact object in the observed binaries.</description>

      <title>Particle creation and evaporation in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine particle creation and the evaporation process in the context of Kalb-Ramond gravity. Specifically, we build upon two existing solutions from the literature [1] (Model I) and [2] (Model II), both addressing a static, spherically symmetric configuration. For this study, we focus on the scenario in which the cosmological constant vanishes. The analysis begins by examining bosonic particles to investigate Hawking radiation. Using the Klein-Gordon equation, the Bogoliubov coefficients are derived, highlighting the role of the parameter $\ell$, which governs Lorentz symmetry breaking, in introducing corrections to the amplitude of particle production. This forms the basis for calculating the Hawking temperature. The study further explores Hawking radiation through the tunneling mechanism, where divergent integrals are solved using the residue method. The particle creation density is also computed for fermionic particle modes. Additionally, greybody bounds are evaluated for bosons and fermions as well. Finally, we analyze the deviation of our results from those predicted by general relativity. In a general panorama, Model I exhibits the highest particle creation densities and the fastest evaporation process, whereas Model II shows the largest greybody factor intensities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology was shown to interpolate between de Sitter and FLRW Universe phases through a bounce by including Euclidean and Lorentzian terms of the Hamiltonian constraint with weight one -that corresponding to classical General Relativity. Unitary evolution required self-adjoint extensions of the constraint and a Planckian cosmological constant was obtained. Independent work took a positive weight to get a cosmological constant with the observed value, without considering unitarity. In this work we address the unitary evolution of the model for arbitrary weight. For non positive weight parameter unitary holds but for positive values self-adjoint extensions are required. To encompass observations the extensions here provided are mandatory. These are implemented in a propagator. Finally, we discuss our results and perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational memory, which describes the permanent shift in the strain after the passage of gravitational waves, is directly related to Weinberg's soft graviton theorems and the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetry group of asymptotically flat space-times. In this work, we provide an equivalent description of the phenomenon in local coordinates around gravitational wave detectors, such as transverse-traceless (TT) gauge. We show that gravitational memory is encoded in large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, which include time-dependent anisotropic spatial rescalings, and prove their equivalence to BMS transformations when translated to TT gauge. We then derive the associated Ward identities and associated soft theorems, for both scattering amplitudes and equal-time (in-in) correlation functions, and explicitly check their validity for planar gravitational waves. The in-in identities are recognized as the flat-space analog of the well-known inflationary consistency relations.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Thermal RG Flow of AS Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the thermal Renormalization Group (RG) study of the Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units) in order to determine its thermal evolution in terms of the dimensionless temperature $\tau$ which is associated with the temperature of the expanding Universe. Thus, $k_T$ and $k$ are understood as running cutoffs for thermal and quantum fluctuations, respectively. Quantum effects are taken into account by moving along the thermal RG trajectory with fixed value of $\tau$ producing the quantum effective action at a given dimensionless temperature. The $\tau$-evolution of the dimensionless Newton coupling $g(\tau)$ and the dimensionless cosmological constant $\lambda(\tau)$ results in a vanishing $g$-coordinate of the Reuter (i.e., non-Gaussian UV) fixed point in the high temperature limit ($\tau \to \infty$) which means that only the symmetric phase of AS gravity survives at $\tau = \infty$. Thus, in case of large temperatures the cosmological constant takes on a negative value in the limit $k\to 0$ which was also initially predicted by certain string theories, however, in our approach this is not in disagreement with observations, since during the thermal evolution of the Universe a phase transition occurs and the cosmological constant runs to the expected positive value at low temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Building upon earlier work, we explore the limits of using a configuration of satellites to measure the trace of the gravitational gradient tensor using intersatellite laser ranging and timing observables without relying on high-precision external observables such as deep space radio navigation or astrometry with unrealistic accuracy. A refined model, calculated with extended numerical precision, confirms that exceptional sensitivity is possible, placing within reach observational tests of certain modified gravity theories (e.g., Yukawa terms, galileons) using heliocentric orbits in the vicinity of the Earth. The sensitivity of the experiment improves at larger heliocentric distances. A constellation placed at 30 astronomical units, still well within the domain of feasibility using available propulsion and deep space communication technologies, may approach sensitivities that are sufficient to detect not just the gravitational contribution of the interplanetary medium but perhaps even cosmological dark matter and dark energy constituents.</description>

Abstract: The calculation of gray-body factors is essential for understanding Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. While the formalism developed by Chandrasekhar is effective for static black holes, it faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. To address these limitations, an alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. We compare the gray-body factors obtained for a near-maximally rotating black hole using both methods and find that the Chandrasekhar formalism systematically overestimates the values in the superradiant regime compared to well-established analytical results. Specifically, for a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the Chandrasekhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. Since this approach has been implemented in \texttt{BlackHawk}, we assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies of QFT in cosmological spacetime indicate that the speeding up of the present universe may not just be associated with a rigid cosmological term but with a running one that evolves with the expansion rate: $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of the vacuum energy density (VED), $\rho_{\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to quantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The VED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic evolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher powers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation. They originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we compute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur: $H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and very large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch. This new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary `inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background and is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific gravitational theory, offers a universal tool for testing gravitational theories and interpreting astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: An AdS$_2$ black hole in equilibrium with a finite temperature non-gravitating bath comes with a Hawking-like information paradox. The resolution of this paradox requires introducing an island for the bath after the Page time. Since the island region contains the black hole interior, the consistency of the island paradigm demands the failure of any interior reconstruction proposal that uses only the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon after the Page time. In this paper, we investigate the consistency of the island paradigm using the black hole interior reconstruction proposal due to Leutheusser and Liu. They argued that the operators in the interior of a black hole can be reconstructed by the half-sided translations of the operators outside the black hole horizon. However, in order to illustrate the island paradigm we need to modify the Leutheusser-Liu proposal by introducing the notion of the reduced half-sided translations. The reduced half-sided translations, unlike the half-sided translations, have non-trivial action only on the operators in the AdS$_2$ black hole region. As a result, the reconstructed interior operators are expressed only using the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon. We demonstrate the consistency of the island paradigm by showing that the reduced half-sided translation, which successfully reconstruct the operators in the black hole interior before the Page time, fails to reconstruct the interior operators after the Page time.</description>

      <title>Spinning waveforms of scalar radiation in quadratic modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <title>Thermal and nonthermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\lesssim w_\phi\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Density of Cosmic Strings with Nonzero Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03723v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is periodically enhanced every ~8.3 days. The periodic nature of the ultrafast outflow is best explained by an orbiting massive perturber, most likely an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), that is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this way, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukova et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intemediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates that otherwise do not exhibit significant periodic patterns in the continuum flux density.</description>

      <title>Introducing Various Notions of Distances between Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of causally-null-compactifiable space-times which can be canonically converted into a compact timed-metric-spaces using the cosmological time of Andersson-Howard-Galloway and the null distance of Sormani-Vega. We produce a large class of such space-times including future developments of compact initial data sets and regions which exhaust asymptotically flat space-times. We then present various notions of intrinsic distances between these space-times (introducing the timed-Hausdorff distance) and prove some of these notions of distance are definite in the sense that they equal zero iff there is a time-oriented Lorentzian isometry between the space-times. These definite distances enable us to define various notions of convergence of space-times to limit space-times which are not necessarily smooth. Many open questions and conjectures are included throughout.</description>

      <title>Detection and parameter estimation of supermassive black hole ringdown signals using a pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) searches using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are commonly assumed to be limited to a GW frequency of $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$Hz given by the Nyquist rate associated with the average observational cadence of $2$ weeks for a single pulsar. However, by taking advantage of asynchronous observations of multiple pulsars, a PTA can detect GW signals at higher frequencies. This allows a sufficiently large PTA to detect and characterize the ringdown signals emitted following the merger of supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), leading to stringent tests of the no-hair theorem in the mass range of such systems. Such large-scale PTAs are imminent with the advent of the FAST telescope and the upcoming era of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). To scope out the data analysis challenges involved in such a search, we propose a likelihood-based method coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization and apply it to a simulated large-scale PTA comprised of $100$ pulsars, each having a timing residual noise standard deviation of $100$~nsec, with randomized observation times. Focusing on the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of the ringdown signal, we show that it is possible to achieve a $99\%$ detection probability with a false alarm probability below $0.2\%$ for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$. This corresponds, for example, to an equal-mass non-spinning SMBBH with an observer frame chirp mass $M_c = 9.52\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at a luminosity distance of $D_L = 420$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Gravitational Wave Events with Host Environment Escape Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events modeled under the assumption of a globular cluster origin scenario. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Dark Energy Models: A Theoretical and Bayesian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the background equivalence among three dark energy models by constructing explicit mappings between dynamical dark energy (DDE), interacting dark energy (IDE), and running vacuum (RV). In our approach, the dark sector functions that characterize each model-such as the equation of state parameter $\bar{w}(a)$ for DDE, the interaction term $Q$ for IDE, and the functional form $\Lambda(H)$ for RV-are transformed into one another under specific assumptions. Extending previous work by von Marttens et al. (2020), we demonstrate that running vacuum models, characterized by $\Lambda(H) = a_0 + a_1 \dot{H} + a_2 H^2$, can be reinterpreted as an interacting dark energy model with $Q = 3H\gamma \hat{\rho}_c$, which in turn is equivalent to a dynamic dark energy model with an appropriately defined $\bar{w}(a)$. Using Bayesian analysis with Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Chronometers, our observational constraints confirm that these theoretical equivalences hold at the background level. This study underscores the importance of seeking convergence in dark energy models, facilitating a better understanding of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $\Omega_m$ and $r_s H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and their implications for resolving the Hubble tension. The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the product of the sound horizon and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these EDE models happen to tend towards this deviation. Therefore, in this work, it is found that DESI Y1 BAO results strengthen the preference for EDE models and help to obtain a higher $H_0$. Even considering the Pantheon+ observations for SNeIa, which have an opposite tendency, DESI still dominates the preference for EDE. This was unforeseen in past SDSS BAO measurements and therefore emphasizes the role of BAO and SNeIa measurements in Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

Abstract: It has been shown that if one solves self-consistently the semiclassical Einstein equations in the presence of a quantum scalar field, with a cutoff on the number of modes, spacetime become flatter when the cutoff increases. Here we extend the result to include the effect of fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1 and 2. With minor adjustments, the main result persists. Remarkably, one can have positive curvature even if the cosmological constant in the bare action is negative.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy within the Generalized Uncertainty Principle in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we modify the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a deformed algebra within the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We formulate the modified Raychaudhuri equation, where new terms are introduced which describe dynamical pressure components. For the quadratic GUP model, we derive the Hubble function, which leads to a time-dependent dark energy model. The free parameters are determined using late-time observational data, the Pantheon+ SNIa sample, the cosmic chronometers, and the DESI 2025 BAO data. We find that the modified model introduce only one new additional degree of freedom compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The GUP-Modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides a better fit to the data than the undeformed theory. Furthermore, we compare the same model with the DESI 2024 BAO data and find that the Bayesian evidence becomes stronger with the inclusion of the DESI 2025 release.</description>
