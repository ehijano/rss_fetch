      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a finite coloring of an amenable group contains `many' monochromatic sets of the form $\{x,y,xy,yx\},$ and natural extensions with more variables. This gives the first combinatorial proof and extensions of Bergelson and McCutcheon's non-commutative Schur theorem. Our main new tool is the introduction of what we call `quasirandom colorings,' a condition that is automatically satisfied by colorings of quasirandom groups, and a reduction to this case.</description>

      <title>Novel Tour Construction Heuristic for Pick-Up and Delivery Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In logistic applications that require the pickup and delivery of items, route optimization problems can be modeled as precedence constrained traveling salesperson problems. The combinatorial nature of this problem restricts the application of exact algorithms to small instances, and heuristics are largely preferred for tractability. However, due to precedence constraints that restrict the order in which locations can be visited, heuristics outside of the nearest neighbor algorithm have been neglected in literature. While the convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is known to produce good solutions in the absence of precedence constraints, i.e., when locations can be visited in any order, it has not been adapted for pick-up and delivery considerations. This paper presents an adapted convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic that accounts for precedence constraints and compares its solutions with the nearest neighbor heuristic using the TSPLIB benchmark data set. The proposed algorithm is particularly suited to cases where pickups are located in the periphery and deliveries are centrally located, outperforming the Nearest Neighbor algorithm in every examined instance.</description>

      <title>Multiple consecutive runs of multi-state trials: distributions of $(k_1, k_2, \dots, k_\ell)$ patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pattern $(k_1, k_2, \dots, k_\ell)$ is defined to have at least $k_1$ consecutive $1$'s followed by at least $k_2$ consecutive $2$'s, $\dots$, followed by at least $k_\ell$ consecutive $\ell$'s. By iteratively applying the method that was developed previously to decouple the combinatorial complexity involved in studying complicated patterns in random sequences, the distribution of pattern $(k_1, k_2, \dots, k_\ell)$ is derived for arbitrary $\ell$. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>A classification of semi-equivelar gems on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-equivelar gem of a PL $d$-manifold is a regular colored graph that represents the PL $d$-manifold and regularly embeds on a surface, with the property that the cyclic sequence of degrees of faces in the embedding around each vertex is identical. In \cite{bb24}, the authors classified semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds embedded on surfaces with Euler characteristics greater than or equal to zero. In this article, we focus on classifying semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds embedded on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$. We prove that if a semi-equivelar gem embeds on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$, then it belongs to one of the following types: $(8^3), (6^2,8), (6^2,12), (10^2,4), (12^2,4),$ $ (4,6,14), (4,6,16), (4,6,18), (4,6,24), (4,8,10), (4,8,12),$ or $(4,8,16)$. Furthermore, we provide constructions that demonstrate the existence of such gems for each of the aforementioned types.</description>

      <title>Nut graphs with a given automorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nut graph is a simple graph of order 2 or more for which the adjacency matrix has a single zero eigenvalue such that all non-zero kernel eigenvectors have no zero entry (i.e. are full). It is shown by construction that every finite group can be represented as the group of automorphisms of infinitely many nut graphs. It is further shown that such nut graphs exist even within the class of regular graphs; the cases where the degree is 8, 12, 16, 20 or 24 are realised explicitly.</description>

      <title>Diameter of the inversion graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an oriented graph $\vec{G}$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both endvertices in $X$. The inversion graph of a labelled graph $G$, denoted by ${\mathcal{I}}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the labelled orientations of $G$ in which two labelled orientations $\vec{G}_1$ and $\vec{G}_2$ of $G$ are adjacent if and only if there is an inversion $X$ transforming $\vec{G}_1$ into $\vec{G}_2$. In this paper, we study the inversion diameter of a graph which is the diameter of its inversion graph denoted by $diam(\mathcal{I}(G))$. We show that the inversion diameter is tied to the star chromatic number, the acyclic chromatic number and the oriented chromatic number. Thus a graph class has bounded inversion diameter if and only if it also has bounded star chromatic number, acyclic chromatic number and oriented chromatic number. We give some upper bounds on the inversion diameter of a graph $G$ contained in one of the following graph classes: planar graphs ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 12$), planar graphs of girth 8 ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 3$), graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2\Delta -1$), graphs with treewidth at mots $t$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2t$).
  We also show that determining the inversion diameter of a given graph is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Anti-Ramsey numbers of loose paths and cycles in uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed family of $r$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{F}$, the anti-Ramsey number of $\mathcal{F}$, denoted by $ ar(n,r,\mathcal{F})$, is the minimum number $c$ of colors such that for any edge-coloring of the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with at least $c$ colors, there is a rainbow copy of some hypergraph in $\mathcal{F}$. Here, a rainbow hypergraph is an edge-colored hypergraph with all edges colored differently. Let $\mathcal{P}_k$ and $\mathcal{C}_k$ be the families of loose paths and loose cycles with $k$ edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph, respectively. In this paper, we determine the exact values of $ ar(n,r,\mathcal{P}_k)$ and $ ar(n,r,\mathcal{C}_k)$ for all $k\geq 4$ and $r\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The bishop and knight checkmate on a large chessboard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1983 the chess periodical EG published a summary of a letter from Julius Telesin outlining how a king, a bishop and a knight can checkmate a lonely king on an arbitrarily large chessboard. The Telesin checkmating procedure doesn't seem to be widely known, and the published account left out a number of details. We describe the method precisely and show that it works against every defense. We also discuss the open question of the asymptotics of the largest distance to mate on a large square board.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Winning Maker Strategy in the Maker-Breaker $C_4$-Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maker-Breaker subgraph games are among the most famous combinatorial games. For given $n,q \in \mathbb{N}$ and a subgraph $C$ of the complete graph $K_n$, the two players, called Maker and Breaker, alternately claim edges of $K_n$. In each round of the game Maker claims one edge and Breaker is allowed to claim up to $q$ edges. If Maker is able to claim all edges of a copy of $C$, he wins the game. Otherwise Breaker wins. In this work we introduce the first constructive strategy for Maker for the $C_4$-Maker-Breaker game and show that he can win the game if $q &lt; 0.16 n^{2/3}$. According to the theorem of Bednarska and Luczak (2000) $n^{2/3}$ is asymptotically optimal for this game, but the constant given there for a random Maker strategy is magnitudes apart from our constant 0.16.</description>

      <title>Homeostasis in Input-Output Networks: Structure, Classification and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homeostasis is concerned with regulatory mechanisms, present in biological systems, where some specific variable is kept close to a set value as some external disturbance affects the system. Mathematically, the notion of homeostasis can be formalized in terms of an input-output function that maps the parameter representing the external disturbance to the output variable that must be kept within a fairly narrow range. This observation inspired the introduction of the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. This point of view allows for the application of methods from singularity theory to characterize infinitesimal homeostasis points (i.e. critical points of the input-output function). In this paper we review the infinitesimal approach to the study of homeostasis in input-output networks. An input-output network is a network with two distinguished nodes `input' and `output', and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. This class of dynamical systems provides an appropriate framework to study homeostasis and several important biological systems can be formulated in this context. Moreover, this approach, coupled to graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory, provides a systematic way for classifying different types of homeostasis (homeostatic mechanisms) in input-output networks, in terms of the network topology. In turn, this leads to new mathematical concepts, such as, homeostasis subnetworks, homeostasis patterns, homeostasis mode interaction. We illustrate the usefulness of this theory with several biological examples: biochemical networks, chemical reaction networks (CRN), gene regulatory networks (GRN), Intracellular metal ion regulation and so on.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When $g\in\mathbb{N}$ we say that $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ is a $B_{2}[g]$ sequence if every $m\in\mathbb{N}$ has at most $g$ distinct representations of the shape $m=b_{1}+b_{2}$ with $b_{1}\leq b_{2}$ and $b_{1},b_{2}\in A$. We show for every $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ that whenever $g&gt;\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ then there is a $B_{2}[g]$ sequence $A$ having the property that every sufficiently large $n\in\mathbb{N}$ can be written as $$n=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3},\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a_{3}\leq n^{\varepsilon}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a_{i}\in A,$$ and satisfying for large $x$ the estimate $$\lvert A\cap [1,x]\rvert\gg x^{g/(2g+1)}.$$ The above lower bound improves upon earlier results of Cilleruelo and of Erd\H{o}s and Renyi.</description>

Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the Euler characteristic of Kontsevich's commutative graph complex. This formula implies that the total amount of commutative graph homology grows super-exponentially with the rank and, via a theorem of Chan, Galatius, and Payne, that the dimension of the top weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves, $\mathcal M_g$, grows super-exponentially with the genus $g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that tropicalization of linear series on curves gives rise to two-parameter families of tilings by polymatroids, with one parameter arising from the theory of divisors on tropical curves and the other from the reduction of linear series of rational functions in non-Archimedean geometry. In order to do this, we introduce a general framework that produces tilings of vector spaces and their subsets by polymatroids. We furthermore show that these tilings are regular and relate them to work by Kapranov and Lafforgue on Chow quotients of Grassmannians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Iwasawa theory from a graph theoretic perspective, focusing on the algebraic and combinatorial properties of Cayley graphs. Using representation theory, we analyze Iwasawa-theoretic invariants within $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs, revealing connections between graph theory, number theory, and group theory. Key results include the factorization of associated Iwasawa polynomials and the decomposition of $\mu$- and $\lambda$-invariants. Additionally, we apply these insights to complete graphs, establishing conditions under which these invariants vanish.</description>

Abstract: We identify an assumption on linear forms $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k: \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{F}_p$ that is much weaker than approximate joint equidistribution on the Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$ and is in a sense almost as weak as linear independence, but which guarantees that every subset of $\{0,1\}^n$ on which none of $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k$ has full image has a density which tends to 0 with $k$. This density is at most quasipolynomially small in $k$, a bound that is necessarily close to sharp.</description>

      <title>The Large Deviation Principle for $W$-random spectral measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $W$-random graphs provide a flexible framework for modeling large random networks. Using the Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for $W$-random graphs from [9], we prove the LDP for the corresponding class of random symmetric Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators. Our main result describes how the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the integral operator are affected by the large deviations in the underlying random graphon. To prove the LDP, we demonstrate continuous dependence of the spectral measures associated with integral operators on the underlying graphons and use the Contraction Principle. To illustrate our results, we obtain leading order asymptotics of the eigenvalues of the integral operators corresponding to certain random graph sequences. These examples suggest several representative scenarios of how the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the integral operators are affected by large deviations. Potential implications of these observations for bifurcation analysis of Dynamical Systems and Graph Signal Processing are indicated.</description>

      <title>On the Walsh and Fourier-Hadamard Supports of Boolean Functions From a Quantum Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the links between Boolean function theory and quantum computing. In particular, we study the notion of what we call fully-balanced functions and analyse the Fourier--Hadamard and Walsh supports of those functions having such property. We study the Walsh and Fourier supports of other relevant classes of functions, using what we call balancing sets. This leads us to revisit and complete certain classic results and to propose new ones.
  We complete our study by extending the previous results to pseudo-Boolean functions (in relation to vectorial functions) and giving an insight on its applications in the analysis of the possibilities that a certain family of quantum algorithms can offer.</description>

      <title>Total orders realizable as the distances between two sets of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we give a negative answer to a question proposed by Almendra-Hern\'andez and Mart\'inez-Sandoval. Let $n\le m$ be positive integers and let $X$ and $Y$ be sets of sizes $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb R^{n-1}$ such that $X\cup Y$ is in generic position. There is a natural order on $X\times Y$ induced by the distances between the corresponding points. The question is if all possible orders on $X\times Y$ can be obtained in this way. We show that the answer is negative when $n&lt;m$. The case $n=m$ remains open.</description>

      <title>On polynomials associated to Voronoi diagrams of point sets and crossing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three polynomials are defined for given sets $S$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane: The Voronoi polynomial with coefficients the numbers of vertices of the order-$k$ Voronoi diagrams of $S$, the circle polynomial with coefficients the numbers of circles through three points of $S$ enclosing $k$ points of $S$, and the $E_{\leq k}$ polynomial with coefficients the numbers of (at most $k$)-edges of $S$. We present several formulas for the rectilinear crossing number of $S$ in terms of these polynomials and their roots. We also prove that the roots of the Voronoi polynomial lie on the unit circle if, and only if, $S$ is in convex position. Further, we present bounds on the location of the roots of these polynomials.</description>

      <title>Redicolouring digraphs: directed treewidth and cycle-degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a digraph $D=(V,A)$ on $n$ vertices and a vertex $v\in V$, the cycle-degree of $v$ is the minimum size of a set $S \subseteq V(D) \setminus \{v\}$ intersecting every directed cycle of $D$ containing $v$. From this definition of cycle-degree, we define the $c$-degeneracy (or cycle-degeneracy) of $D$, which we denote by $\delta^*_c(D)$. It appears to be a nice generalisation of the undirected degeneracy. In this work, using this new definition of cycle-degeneracy, we extend several evidences for Cereceda's conjecture to digraphs. The $k$-dicolouring graph of $D$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_k(D)$, is the undirected graph whose vertices are the $k$-dicolourings of $D$ and in which two $k$-dicolourings are adjacent if they differ on the colour of exactly one vertex.
  We show that $\mathcal{D}_k(D)$ has diameter at most $O_{\delta^*_c(D)}(n^{\delta^*_c(D) + 1})$ (respectively $O(n^2)$ and $(\delta^*_c(D)+1)n$) when $k$ is at least $\delta^*_c(D)+2$ (respectively $\frac{3}{2}(\delta^*_c(D)+1)$ and $2(\delta^*_c(D)+1)$). This improves known results on digraph redicolouring (Bousquet et al.).
  Next, we extend a result due to Feghali to digraphs, showing that $\mathcal{D}_{d+1}(D)$ has diameter at most $O_{d,\epsilon}(n(\log n)^{d-1})$ when $D$ has maximum average cycle-degree at most $d-\epsilon$. We then show that two proofs of Bonamy and Bousquet for undirected graphs can be extended to digraphs. The first one uses the digrundy number of a digraph and the second one uses the $\mathscr{D}$-width.
  Finally, we give a general theorem which makes a connection between the recolourability of a digraph $D$ and the recolourability of its underlying graph $UG(D)$. This result directly extends a number of results on planar graph recolouring to planar digraph redicolouring.</description>

      <title>Maximal line-free sets in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ that do not contain progressions of length $k$. We denote by $r_k(\mathbb{F}_p^n)$ the cardinality of such subsets containing a maximal number of elements.
  In this paper we focus on the case $k=p$ and therefore sets containing no full line. A~trivial lower bound $r_p(\mathbb{F}_p^n)\geq(p-1)^n$ is achieved by a hypercube of side length $p-1$ and it is known that equality holds for $n\in\{1,2\}$. We will however show that $r_p(\mathbb{F}_p^3)\geq (p-1)^3+p-2\sqrt{p}$, which is the first improvement in the three dimensional case that is increasing in $p$.
  We will also give the upper bound $r_p(\mathbb{F}_p^{3})\leq p^3-2p^2-(\sqrt{2}-1)p+2$ as well as generalizations for higher dimensions.
  Finally we present some bounds for individual $p$ and $n$, in particular $r_5(\mathbb{F}_5^{3})\geq 70$ and $r_7(\mathbb{F}_7^{3})\geq 225$ which can be used to give the asymptotic lower bound $4.121^n$ for $r_5(\mathbb{F}_5^{n})$ and $6.082^n$ for $r_7(\mathbb{F}_7^{n})$.</description>

      <title>Antimagicness of Tensor product for some wheel related graphs with star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ with $p$ vertices and $q$ edges has an antimagic labelling if there is a bijection from the graph's edge set to the label set $\left\{1,2, \cdots, q \right\}$ such that $p$ vertices must have distinct vertex sums, where the vertex sums are determined by adding up all the edge labels incident to each vertex $v$ in $V(G)$. Hartsfield and Ringel \cite{Ringel1} in the book "Pearls in Graph Theory" conjectured that every connected graph is antimagic, with the exception of $P_2$. In this study, we identified a class of connected graphs that lend credence to the conjecture. In this article, we proved that the tensor product of a wheel and a star, a helm and a star, and a flower and a star is antimagic.</description>

      <title>Permutation Tutte polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Tutte polynomial is a two-variate polynomial $T_G(x,y)$ associated to graphs or more generally, matroids. In this paper, we introduce a polynomial $\widetilde{T}_H(x,y)$ associated to a bipartite graph $H$ that we call the permutation Tutte polynomial of the graph $H$. It turns out that $T_G(x,y)$ and $\widetilde{T}_H(x,y)$ share many properties, and the permutation Tutte polynomial serves as a tool to study the classical Tutte polynomial. We discuss the analogs of Brylawsi's identities and Conde--Merino--Welsh type inequalities. In particular, we will show that if $H$ does not contain isolated vertices, then $$\widetilde{T}_H(3,0)\widetilde{T}_H(0,3)\geq \widetilde{T}_H(1,1)^2,$$ which gives a short proof to the analogous result of Jackson: $$T_G(3,0)T_G(0,3)\geq T_G(1,1)^2$$ for graphs without loops and bridges. We also improve on the constant $3$ in this statement by showing that one can replace it with $2.9243$.</description>

Abstract: We study several basic problems about colouring the $p$-random subgraph $G_p$ of an arbitrary graph $G$, focusing primarily on the chromatic number and colouring number of $G_p$. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many $k$-regular graphs $G$ for which the colouring number (i.e., degeneracy) of $G_{1/2}$ is at most $k/3 + o(k)$ with high probability, thus disproving the natural prediction that such random graphs must have colouring number at least $k/2 - o(k)$.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of $\mu$-signed and duplication signed graphs and shows that both are always structurally balanced. Using the duplication signed graph, we define the corona product of the duplication signed graph (Duplication add vertex corona product and duplication vertex corona product) and explore their structural properties. Additionally, we provide the adjacency spectrum of both the products for any $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, and the Laplacian and signless Laplacian spectrum for regular $\Gamma_1$ and arbitrary $\Gamma_2$, in terms of the corresponding spectrum of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. Finally, we discuss its application in generating integral and equienergetic signed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a matroid, we define a new simplicial complex whose facets are indexed by its independent sets. This complex contains the external activity complex as a subcomplex. We call our complex the augmented external activity complex since its definition is motivated by the recently defined augmented tautological classes of matroids. We prove that our complex is shellable and show that our shelling satisfies the stronger property of being an $H$-shelling. This explicates our result that the $h$-vector of our complex is the $f$-vector of the independence complex. We also define an augmented no broken circuit complex, which contains the usual no broken circuit complex as a subcomplex. We prove its shellability and show that our shelling is also an $H$-shelling. The $h$-vector of this complex is the $f$-vector of the no broken circuit complex.</description>

      <title>Canonical labelling of Latin squares in average-case polynomial time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Latin square of order $n$ is an $n\times n$ matrix in which each row and column contains each of $n$ symbols exactly once. For $\epsilon&gt;0$, we show that with high probability a uniformly random Latin square of order $n$ has no proper subsquare of order larger than $n^{1/2}\log^{1/2+\epsilon}n$. Using this fact we present a canonical labelling algorithm for Latin squares of order $n$ that runs in average time bounded by a polynomial in $n$.
  The algorithm can be used to solve isomorphism problems for many combinatorial objects that can be encoded using Latin squares, including quasigroups, Steiner triple systems, Mendelsohn triple systems, $1$-factorisations, nets, affine planes and projective planes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study dual quaternion and dual complex unit gain graphs and their spectral properties in a unified frame of dual unit gain graphs. Unit dual quaternions represent rigid movements in the 3D space, and have wide applications in robotics and computer graphics. Dual complex numbers found application in brain science recently. We establish the interlacing theorem for dual unit gain graphs, and show that the spectral radius of a dual unit gain graph is always not greater than the spectral radius of the underlying graph, and these two radii are equal if and only if the dual gain graph is balanced. By using the dual cosine functions, we establish the closed form of eigenvalues of adjacency and Laplacian matrices of dual complex and quaternion unit gain cycles. We then show the coefficient theorem holds for dual unit gain graphs. Similar results hold for the spectral radius of the Laplacian matrix of the dual unit gain graph too.</description>

Abstract: $\lambda$-quiddities of size $n$ are $n$-tuples of elements of a fixed set, solutions of a matrix equation appearing in the study of Coxeter's friezes. The study of these solutions involves in particular the use of a notion of irreducibility. The main objective of this text is to show that there is a finite number of irreducible $\lambda$-quiddities over a finite unitary commutative ring and to obtain in this case an upper bound of the maximal size of them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether or not the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group count some set of combinatorial objects is a longstanding open question. In this work we show that a given Kronecker coefficient is proportional to the rank of a projector that can be measured efficiently using a quantum computer. In other words a Kronecker coefficient counts the dimension of the vector space spanned by the accepting witnesses of a QMA verifier, where QMA is the quantum analogue of NP. This implies that approximating the Kronecker coefficients to within a given relative error is not harder than a certain natural class of quantum approximate counting problems that captures the complexity of estimating thermal properties of quantum many-body systems. A second consequence is that deciding positivity of Kronecker coefficients is contained in QMA, complementing a recent NP-hardness result of Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley and Walter. We obtain similar results for the related problem of approximating row sums of the character table of the symmetric group. Finally, we discuss an efficient quantum algorithm that approximates normalized Kronecker coefficients to inverse-polynomial additive error.</description>

      <title>Local certification of geometric graph classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of local certification is to locally convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies a given property. A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize the size of the certificates.
  In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. These bounds are tight up to a constant factor and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have linear size. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on the size of the certificates, and an upper bound of $O(n \log n)$. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: A countable structure is indivisible if for every coloring with finite range there is a monochromatic isomorphic subcopy of the structure. Each indivisible structure naturally corresponds to an indivisibility problem which outputs such a subcopy given a presentation and coloring. We investigate the Weihrauch complexity of the indivisibility problems for two structures: the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ as a linear order, and the equivalence relation $\mathscr{E}$ with countably many equivalence classes each having countably many members. We separate the Weihrauch degrees of both corresponding indivisibility problems from several benchmarks, showing in particular that the indivisibility problem for $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot solve the problem of finding a monochromatic rational interval given a coloring for which there is one; and that the Weihrauch degree of the indivisibility problem for $\mathscr{E}$ is strictly between those of $\mathsf{RT}^2$ and $\mathsf{SRT}^2$, two widely studied variants of Ramsey's theorem for pairs whose reverse-mathematical separation was open until recently.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a deformation of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, regarding the relationship between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ and the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\frac{\mu}{(n+2)!} &gt; \widetilde{p}_g.$$ We provide evidence by confirming the conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>
