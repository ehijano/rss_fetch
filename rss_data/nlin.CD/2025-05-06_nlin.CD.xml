      <title>Data-Driven Decomposition of Conservative and Non-Conservative Dynamics in Multiscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for reconstructing physics-consistent reduced models of multiscale systems. Our approach addresses a fundamental challenge in model reduction: decomposing the deterministic drift into its conservative (reversible) and non-conservative (irreversible) components while preserving the system's invariant measure and autocorrelation. We leverage the k-means Gaussian-mixture method (KGMM) to robustly estimate the score function -- the gradient of the logarithm of the steady-state probability density. This score function is then combined with a finite-volume discretization of the Perron-Frobenius generator to identify a drift matrix whose symmetric part captures the conservative dynamics and whose antisymmetric part encodes the minimal irreversible circulation required by the empirical data. The result is a reduced Langevin model that preserves the stationary density, reproduces short-time correlations by construction, and maintains computational efficiency. We validate our framework on three increasingly complex systems: a one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic system with multiplicative noise, a two-dimensional asymmetric four-well potential system with non-gradient drift, and the stochastic Lorenz-63 attractor. In all cases, our surrogate models accurately recover both the stationary distribution and autocorrelation structure of the original dynamics, while providing an interpretable separation of conservative and non-conservative forces.</description>

      <title>Braided mixing in confined chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.</description>

      <title>Exponential map of germs of vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an exponential map of the algebra of germs of vector fields into the group of germs of diffeomorphisms at zero. It is shown that this mapping is not a bijection. A brief review of the key results of the analytic iteration problem is given.</description>
