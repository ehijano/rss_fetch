      <title>Boiling flow parameter estimation from boundary layer data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects cause phase aberrations in propagating light waves, thereby reducing effectiveness in transmitting and receiving coherent light from an aircraft. Existing optical sensors can measure the resulting phase aberrations, but the physical experiments required to induce these aberrations are expensive and time-intensive. Simulation methods could provide a less expensive alternative. For example, an existing simulation algorithm called boiling flow, which generalizes the Taylor frozen-flow method, can generate synthetic phase aberration data (i.e., phase screens) induced by atmospheric turbulence. However, boiling flow depends on physical parameters, such as the Fried coherence length r0, which are not well-defined for aero-optic effects. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate the parameters of boiling flow from measured aero-optic phase aberration data. Our algorithm estimates these parameters to fit the spatial and temporal statistics of the measured data. This method is computationally efficient and our experiments show that the temporal power spectral density of the slopes of the synthetic phase screens reasonably matches that of the measured phase aberrations from two turbulent boundary layer data sets, with errors between 8-9%. However, the Kolmogorov spatial structure function of the phase screens does not match that of the measured phase aberrations, with errors above 28%. This suggests that, while the parameters of boiling flow can reasonably fit the temporal statistics of highly convective data, they cannot fit the complex spatial statistics of aero-optic phase aberrations.</description>

      <title>RadarEye: Robust Liquid Level Tracking Using mmWave Radar in Robotic Pouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent liquid manipulation in robotic pouring remains challenging for perception systems: specular/refraction effects and lighting variability degrade visual cues, undermining reliable level estimation. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarEye, a real-time mmWave radar signal processing pipeline for robust liquid level estimation and tracking during the whole pouring process. RadarEye integrates (i) a high-resolution range-angle beamforming module for liquid level sensing and (ii) a physics-informed mid-pour tracker that suppresses multipath to maintain lock on the liquid surface despite stream-induced clutter and source container reflections. The pipeline delivers sub-millisecond latency. In real-robot water-pouring experiments, RadarEye achieves a 0.35 cm median absolute height error at 0.62 ms per update, substantially outperforming vision and ultrasound baselines.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Variational Bayesian Learning for Channel Estimation with OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has demonstrated significant advantages in high-mobility scenarios in future 6G networks. However, existing channel estimation methods often overlook the structured sparsity and clustering characteristics inherent in realistic clustered delay line (CDL) channels, leading to degraded performance in practical systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian learning (NPBL) framework for OTFS channel estimation. Specifically, a stick-breaking process is introduced to automatically infer the number of multipath components and assign each path to its corresponding cluster. The channel coefficients within each cluster are modeled by a Gaussian mixture distribution to capture complex fading statistics. Furthermore, an effective pruning criterion is designed to eliminate spurious multipath components, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy and reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean squared error compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Clutter-Aware Integrated Sensing and Communication: Models, Methods, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can substantially improve spectral, hardware, and energy efficiency by unifying radar sensing and data communications. In wideband and scattering-rich environments, clutter often dominates weak target reflections and becomes a fundamental bottleneck for reliable sensing. Practical ISAC clutter includes "cold" clutter arising from environmental backscatter of the probing waveform, and "hot" clutter induced by external interference and reflections from the environment whose statistics can vary rapidly over time. In this article, we develop a unified wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) signal model that captures both clutter types across the space, time, and frequency domains. Building on this model, we review clutter characterization at multiple levels, including amplitude statistics, robust spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) modeling, and structured covariance representations suitable for limited-snapshot regimes. We then summarize receiver-side suppression methods in the temporal and spatial domains, together with extensions to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and space-frequency-time adaptive processing (SFTAP), and we provide guidance on selecting techniques under different waveform and interference conditions. To move beyond reactive suppression, we discuss clutter-aware transceiver co-design that couples beamforming and waveform optimization with practical communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints to enable proactive clutter avoidance. We conclude with open challenges and research directions toward environment-adaptive and clutter-resilient ISAC for next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Transfer to Sky: Unveil Low-Altitude Route-Level Radio Maps via Ground Crowdsourced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy is contingent on reliable cellular connectivity for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A key challenge in pre-flight planning is predicting communication link quality along proposed and pre-defined routes, a task hampered by sparse measurements that render existing radio map methods ineffective. This paper introduces a transfer learning framework for high-fidelity route-level radio map prediction. Our key insight is to leverage abundant crowdsourced ground signals as auxiliary supervision. To bridge the significant domain gap between ground and aerial data and address spatial sparsity, our framework learns general propagation priors from simulation, performs adversarial alignment of the feature spaces, and is fine-tuned on limited real UAV measurements. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Meituan show that our method achieves over 50% higher accuracy in predicting Route RSRP compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Design of Active RIS-Assisted Satellite Downlinks under Interference, Folded Noise, and EIRP Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate the double-fading loss of passive reflection in satellite downlinks. However, their gains are limited by random co-channel interference, gain-dependent amplifier noise, and regulatory emission constraints. This paper develops a stochastic reliability framework for active RIS-assisted satellite downlinks by modeling the desired and interfering channels, receiver noise, and RIS amplifier noise as random variables. The resulting instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model explicitly captures folded cascaded amplifier noise and reveals a finite high-gain SINR ceiling.
  To guarantee a target outage level, we formulate a chance-constrained max-SINR design that jointly optimizes the binary RIS configuration and a common amplification gain. The chance constraint is handled using a sample-average approximation (SAA) with a violation budget. The resulting feasibility problem is solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP) within a bisection search over the SINR threshold. Practical implementation is enforced by restricting the gain to an admissible range determined by small-signal stability and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) limits.
  We also derive realization-wise SINR envelopes based on eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds, which provide interpretable performance limits and fast diagnostics. Monte Carlo results show that these envelopes tightly bound the simulated SINR, reproduce the predicted saturation behavior, and quantify performance degradation as interference increases. Overall, the paper provides a solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology whose achieved reliability is validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic randomness and hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Constellation Design for Robust Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates symbol detection for single-carrier communication systems operating in the presence of additive interference with Nakagami-m statistics. Such interference departs from the assumptions underlying conventional detection methods based on Gaussian noise models and leads to detection mismatch that fundamentally affects symbol-level performance. In particular, the presence of random interference amplitude and non-uniform phase alters the structure of the optimal decision regions and renders standard Euclidean distance-based detectors suboptimal. To address this challenge, we develop the maximum-likelihood Gaussian-phase approximate (ML-G) detector, a low-complexity detection rule that accurately approximates maximum-likelihood detection while remaining suitable for practical implementation. The proposed detector explicitly incorporates the statistical properties of the interference and induces decision regions that differ significantly from those arising under conventional metrics. Building on the ML-G framework, we further investigate constellation design under interference-aware detection and formulate an optimization problem that seeks symbol placements that minimize the symbol error probability subject to an average energy constraint. The resulting constellations are obtained numerically and adapt to the interference environment, exhibiting non-standard and asymmetric structures as interference strength increases. Simulation results demonstrate clear symbol error probability gains over established benchmark schemes across a range of interference conditions, particularly in scenarios with dominant additive interference.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Signal Component Decomposition via Diffusion-within-Gibbs Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In signal processing, the data collected from sensing devices is often a noisy linear superposition of multiple components, and the estimation of components of interest constitutes a crucial pre-processing step. In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Antenna-Enabled Integrated Bistatic Sensing and Backscatter Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a fluid-antenna-enabled integrated bistatic sensing and backscatter communication system for future networks where connectivity, power delivery, and environmental awareness are jointly supported by the same infrastructure. A multi-antenna base station (BS) with transmitting fluid antennas serves downlink users, energizes passive tags, and illuminates radar targets, while a spatially separated multi-antenna reader decodes tag backscatter and processes radar echoes to avoid the strong self-interference that would otherwise obscure weak returns at the BS. The coexistence of tags and targets, however, induces severe near--far disparities and multi-signal interference, which can be mitigated by fluid antennas through additional spatial degrees of freedom that reshape the multi-hop channels. We formulate a transmit-power minimization problem that jointly optimizes the BS information beamformers, sensing covariance matrix, reader receive beamformers, tag reflection coefficients, and fluid-antenna (FA) positions under heterogeneous quality of service constraints for communication, backscatter, and sensing, as well as energy-harvesting and FA geometry requirements. To tackle the resulting non-convex problem, we develop an alternating-optimization block-coordinate framework that solves four tractable subproblems using semidefinite relaxation, majorization--minimization, and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show consistent transmit-power savings over fixed-position antennas and zero-forcing baselines, achieving about 13.7% and 54.5% reductions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent Evaluation of Commonly Used Near-Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field multi-antenna wireless communication has attracted growing research interest in recent years. Despite this development, most of the current literature on antennas and reflecting structures relies on simplified models, whose validity for real systems remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce a physically consistent near-field model, which we use to evaluate commonly used models. Our results indicate that common models are sufficient for basic beamfocusing, but fail to accurately predict the sidelobes and frequency dependence of reflecting structures.</description>

      <title>Reed-Muller Error-Correction Code Encoder for SFQ-to-CMOS Interface Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting digital electronics such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic to semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is subject to bit errors due to, e.g., flux trapping, process parameter variations (PPV), and fabrication defects. In this paper, a lightweight hardware-efficient error-correction code encoder is designed and analyzed. Particularly, a Reed-Muller code RM(1,3) encoder is implemented with SFQ digital logic. The proposed RM(1,3) encoder converts a 4-bit message into an 8-bit codeword and can detect and correct up to 3- and 1-bit errors, respectively. This encoder circuit is designed using MIT-LL SFQ5ee process and SuperTools/ColdFlux RSFQ cell library. A simulation framework integrating JoSIM simulator and MATLAB script for automated data collection and analysis, is proposed to study the performance of RM(1,3) encoder. The proposed encoder improves the probability of having no bit errors by 6.7% as compared to an encoder-less design under $\pm20\%$ PPV. With $\pm15\%$ and lower PPV, the proposed encoder could correct all errors with at least 99.1% probability. The impact of fabrication defects such as open circuit faults on the encoder circuit is also studied using the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrated Sensing and Computation with Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum operations with indefinite causal order (ICO) represent a framework in quantum information processing where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.</description>

      <title>Binary Flow Matching: Prediction-Loss Space Alignment for Robust Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.</description>

      <title>LOREN: Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation in Neural Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network based receivers have recently demonstrated superior system-level performance compared to traditional receivers. However, their practicality is limited by high memory and power requirements, as separate weight sets must be stored for each code rate. To address this challenge, we propose LOREN, a Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation Neural Receiver that achieves adaptability with minimal overhead. LOREN integrates lightweight low rank adaptation adapters (LOREN adapters) into convolutional layers, freezing a shared base network while training only small adapters per code rate. An end-to-end training framework over 3GPP CDL channels ensures robustness across realistic wireless environments. LOREN achieves comparable or superior performance relative to fully retrained base neural receivers. The hardware implementation of LOREN in 22nm technology shows more than 65% savings in silicon area and up to 15% power reduction when supporting three code rates.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Attention-Based Multi-Agent PPO for Latency Spike Resolution in 6G RAN Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) radio access networks (RANs) must enforce strict service-level agreements (SLAs) for heterogeneous slices, yet sudden latency spikes remain difficult to diagnose and resolve with conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or explainable RL (XRL). We propose \emph{Attention-Enhanced Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (AE-MAPPO)}, which integrates six specialized attention mechanisms into multi-agent slice control and surfaces them as zero-cost, faithful explanations. The framework operates across O-RAN timescales with a three-phase strategy: predictive, reactive, and inter-slice optimization.
  A URLLC case study shows AE-MAPPO resolves a latency spike in $18$ms, restores latency to $0.98$ms with $99.9999\%$ reliability, and reduces troubleshooting time by $93\%$ while maintaining eMBB and mMTC continuity. These results confirm AE-MAPPO's ability to combine SLA compliance with inherent interpretability, enabling trustworthy and real-time automation for 6G RAN slicing.</description>

      <title>Digging for Data: Experiments in Rock Pile Characterization Using Only Proprioceptive Sensing in Excavation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.</description>

      <title>Advancing Brainwave-Based Biometrics: A Large-Scale, Multi-Session Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of brainwave-based biometrics has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize user authentication through hands-free interaction, resistance to shoulder surfing, continuous authentication, and revocability. However, current research often relies on single-session or limited-session datasets with fewer than 55 subjects, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study using a public brainwave dataset comprising 345 subjects and over 6,007 sessions (an average of 17 per subject) recorded over five years using three headsets. Our results reveal that deep learning approaches significantly outperform hand-crafted feature extraction methods. We also observe Equal Error Rates (EER) increases over time (e.g., from 6.7% after 1 day to 14.3% after a year). Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the enrollment set after successful login attempts. Moreover, we demonstrate that fewer brainwave measurement sensors can be used, with an acceptable increase in EER, which is necessary for transitioning from medical-grade to affordable consumer-grade devices. Finally, we compared our results to prior work and existing biometric standards. While our performance is on par with or exceeds previous approaches, it still falls short of industrial benchmarks. Based on the results, we hypothesize that further improvements are possible with larger training sets. To support future research, we have open-sourced our analysis code.</description>

      <title>Mixed Near-field and Far-field Localization in Extremely Large-scale MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient \emph{mixed near-field and far-field} target localization methods in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems Compared with existing works, we address two new challenges in target localization of MIMO communication systems via using decoupled subspace methods, arising from the half-wavelength antenna spacing constraint and \emph{hybrid uniform planar array} (UPA) architectures.To this end, we propose a new three-step mixed-field localization method. First, we reconstruct the equivalent signals received at UPA antennas by judiciously designing analog combining matrices over time with minimum recovery errors.Second, based on recovered signals, we extend the modified multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to the UPA architectures by constructing a new covariance matrix of a virtual sparse UPA (S-UPA) to decouple the 2D angles and range estimation.Due to the structure of the S-UPA, there exist ambiguous angles when estimating true angles of targets.In the third step, we design an effective classification method to distinguish mixed-field targets, determine true angles of all targets, as well as estimate the ranges of near-field targets.In particular, angular ambiguity is resolved by showing an important fact that the three types of estimated angles (i.e., far-field, near-field, and ambiguous angles) exhibit significantly different patterns in the range-domain MUSIC spectrum.Furthermore, to characterize the estimation error lower-bound, we obtain a matrix closed-form Cram\'er-Rao bounds for mixed-field target localization.Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mixed-field localization method, which improves target-classification accuracy and achieves a lower root mean square error than various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Expectation-maximization for low-SNR multi-reference alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem of recovering a signal from noisy observations acted on by unknown random circular shifts. While the information-theoretic limits of MRA are well characterized in many settings, the algorithmic behavior at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the regime of practical interest, remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, a widely used method for MRA, and characterize its convergence dynamics and initialization dependence in the low-SNR limit.
  On the convergence side, we prove a two-phase phenomenon near the ground truth as $\mathrm{SNR}\to 0$: an initial contraction with error decaying as $\exp(-\, \mathrm{SNR} \cdot t)$ followed by a much slower phase scaling as $\exp(- \,\mathrm{SNR}^2 \cdot t)$, where $t$ is the iteration number. This yields an iteration-complexity lower bound $T \gtrsim \mathrm{SNR}^{-2}$ to reach a small fixed target accuracy, revealing a severe computational bottleneck at low SNR. We also identify a finite-sample instability, which we term \emph{Ghost of Newton}, in which EM initially approaches the ground truth but later diverges, degrading reconstruction quality.
  On the bias side, we analyze EM in the noise-only setting ($\mathrm{SNR}=0$), a regime referred to as Einstein from Noise, to highlight its pronounced sensitivity to initialization. We prove that the EM map preserves the Fourier phases of the initialization across all iterations, while the corresponding Fourier magnitudes contract toward zero at a slow rate of $(1+T)^{-1/2}$. Consequently, although the amplitudes vanish in the limit of $T \to \infty$ iterations, the reconstructed structure continues to reflect the geometry encoded by the template's Fourier phases. Together, these results expose fundamental computational and initialization-driven limitations of EM for MRA in the low-SNR regime.</description>

      <title>Predictive Communications for Low-Altitude Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19775v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. Proposed complementary analyses indicate that the individuality is primarily encoded in the QRS-related ECG features across all four domains. Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude, providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.</description>

      <title>An Indoor Radio Mapping Dataset Combining 3D Point Clouds and RSSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing number of smart devices supporting bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time video analytics, smart sensing, Extended Reality (XR), etc., necessitates reliable wireless connectivity in indoor environments. In such environments, accurate design of Radio Environment Maps (REMs) enables adaptive wireless network planning and optimization of Access Point (AP) placement. However, generating realistic REMs remains difficult due to the variability of indoor environments and the limitations of existing modeling approaches, which often rely on simplified layouts or fully synthetic data. These challenges are further amplified by the adoption of next-generation Wi-Fi standards, which operate at higher frequencies and suffer from limited range and wall penetration. To support the efforts in addressing these challenges, we collected a dataset that combines high-resolution 3D LiDAR scans with Wi-Fi RSSI measurements collected across 20 setups in a multi-room indoor environment. The dataset includes two measurement scenarios, the first without human presence in the environment, and the second with human presence, enabling the development and validation of REM estimation models that incorporate physical geometry and environmental dynamics. The described dataset supports research in data-driven wireless modeling and the development of high-capacity indoor communication networks.</description>

      <title>Energy Injection Identification enabled Disaggregation with Deep Multi-Task Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy sources such as solar panels and battery storage poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The energy injected from the BTM sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decrease in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification. Using a Transformer-based architecture that integrates sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies, DualNILM effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. Extensive evaluation on self-collected and synthesized datasets demonstrates that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods. Our work underscores the framework's potential for robust energy disaggregation in modern energy systems with renewable penetration. Synthetic photovoltaic augmented datasets with realistic injection simulation methodology are open-sourced at https://github.com/MathAdventurer/PV-Augmented-NILM-Datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost. We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</description>

      <title>A UAV-Based VNIR Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset for Landmine and UXO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic induction (EMI) data from the same test field.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Reflective Near-Field Beamfocusing using a b-bit RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first experimental validation of reflective near-field beamfocusing using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). While beamfocusing has been theoretically established as a key feature of large-aperture RISs, its practical realization has remained unexplored. We derive new analytical expressions for the array gain achieved with a $b$-bit RIS in near-field line-of-sight scenarios, characterizing both the finite depth and angular width of the focal region. The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS. The experiments confirm that beamfocusing can be dynamically achieved and accurately predicted by the proposed simplified analytical model, despite the presence of hardware imperfections and multipath propagation. These findings demonstrate that near-field beamfocusing is a robust and practically viable feature of RIS-assisted wireless communications.</description>

Abstract: The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</description>
