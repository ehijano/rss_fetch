      <title>Tracing protein and proteome history with chronologies and networks: folding recapitulates evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: While the origin and evolution of proteins remain mysterious, advances in evolutionary genomics and systems biology are facilitating the historical exploration of the structure, function and organization of proteins and proteomes. Molecular chronologies are series of time events describing the history of biological systems and subsystems and the rise of biological innovations. Together with time-varying networks, these chronologies provide a window into the past. Areas covered: Here, we review molecular chronologies and networks built with modern methods of phylogeny reconstruction. We discuss how chronologies of structural domain families uncover the explosive emergence of metabolism, the late rise of translation, the co-evolution of ribosomal proteins and rRNA, and the late development of the ribosomal exit tunnel; events that coincided with a tendency to shorten folding time. Evolving networks described the early emergence of domains and a late big bang of domain combinations. Expert opinion: Two processes, folding and recruitment appear central to the evolutionary progression. The former increases protein persistence. The later fosters diversity. Chronologically, protein evolution mirrors folding by combining supersecondary structures into domains, developing translation machinery to facilitate folding speed and stability, and enhancing structural complexity by establishing long-distance interactions in novel structural and architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Utility of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Antimicrobial Resistance in Hospital Outbreak Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of hospital outbreak clusters is crucial for preventing the spread of infections that have epidemic potential. While assessing pathogen similarity through whole genome sequencing (WGS) is considered the gold standard for outbreak detection, its high cost and lengthy turnaround time preclude routine implementation in clinical laboratories. We explore the utility of two rapid and cost-effective alternatives to WGS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and antimicrobial resistance (AR) patterns. We develop a machine learning framework that extracts informative representations from MALDI-TOF spectra and AR patterns for outbreak detection and explore their fusion. Through multi-species analyses, we demonstrate that in some cases MALDI-TOF and AR have the potential to reduce reliance on WGS, enabling more accessible and rapid outbreak surveillance.</description>

      <title>U-FedTomAtt: Ultra-lightweight Federated Learning with Attention for Tomato Disease Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving and efficient approach for deploying intelligent agricultural solutions. Accurate edge-based diagnosis across geographically dispersed farms is crucial for recognising tomato diseases in sustainable farming. Traditional centralised training aggregates raw data on a central server, leading to communication overhead, privacy risks and latency. Meanwhile, edge devices require lightweight networks to operate effectively within limited resources. In this paper, we propose U-FedTomAtt, an ultra-lightweight federated learning framework with attention for tomato disease recognition in resource-constrained and distributed environments. The model comprises only 245.34K parameters and 71.41 MFLOPS. First, we propose an ultra-lightweight neural network with dilated bottleneck (DBNeck) modules and a linear transformer to minimise computational and memory overhead. To mitigate potential accuracy loss, a novel local-global residual attention (LoGRA) module is incorporated. Second, we propose the federated dual adaptive weight aggregation (FedDAWA) algorithm that enhances global model accuracy. Third, our framework is validated using three benchmark datasets for tomato diseases under simulated federated settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 0.9910% and 0.9915% Top-1 accuracy and 0.9923% and 0.9897% F1-scores on SLIF-Tomato and PlantVillage tomato datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation Scheme for Raman Spectra with Highly Correlated Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In biotechnology Raman Spectroscopy is rapidly gaining popularity as a process analytical technology (PAT) that measures cell densities, substrate- and product concentrations. As it records vibrational modes of molecules it provides that information non-invasively in a single spectrum. Typically, partial least squares (PLS) is the model of choice to infer information about variables of interest from the spectra. However, biological processes are known for their complexity where convolutional neural networks (CNN) present a powerful alternative. They can handle non-Gaussian noise and account for beam misalignment, pixel malfunctions or the presence of additional substances. However, they require a lot of data during model training, and they pick up non-linear dependencies in the process variables. In this work, we exploit the additive nature of spectra in order to generate additional data points from a given dataset that have statistically independent labels so that a network trained on such data exhibits low correlations between the model predictions. We show that training a CNN on these generated data points improves the performance on datasets where the annotations do not bear the same correlation as the dataset that was used for model training. This data augmentation technique enables us to reuse spectra as training data for new contexts that exhibit different correlations. The additional data allows for building a better and more robust model. This is of interest in scenarios where large amounts of historical data are available but are currently not used for model training. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method using synthetic spectra of Ralstonia eutropha batch cultivations to monitor substrate, biomass and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymer concentrations during of the experiments.</description>

      <title>AtlasPatch: Efficient Tissue Detection and High-throughput Patch Extraction for Computational Pathology at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) preprocessing, comprising tissue detection followed by patch extraction, is foundational to AI-driven computational pathology but remains a major bottleneck for scaling to large and heterogeneous cohorts. We present AtlasPatch, a scalable framework that couples foundation-model tissue detection with high-throughput patch extraction at minimal computational overhead. Our tissue detector achieves high precision (0.986) and remains robust across varying tissue conditions (e.g., brightness, fragmentation, boundary definition, tissue heterogeneity) and common artifacts (e.g., pen/ink markings, scanner streaks). This robustness is enabled by our annotated, heterogeneous multi-cohort training set of ~30,000 WSI thumbnails combined with efficient adaptation of the Segment-Anything (SAM) model. AtlasPatch also reduces end-to-end WSI preprocessing time by up to 16$\times$ versus widely used deep-learning pipelines, without degrading downstream task performance. The AtlasPatch tool is open-source, efficiently parallelized for practical deployment, and supports options to save extracted patches or stream them into common feature-extraction models for on-the-fly embedding, making it adaptable to both pathology departments (tissue detection and quality control) and AI researchers (dataset creation and model training). AtlasPatch software package is available at https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/AtlasPatch.</description>
