      <title>Identifying and Clustering Counter Relationships of Team Compositions in PvP Games for Efficient Balance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can balance be quantified in game settings? This question is crucial for game designers, especially in player-versus-player (PvP) games, where analyzing the strength relations among predefined team compositions-such as hero combinations in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games or decks in card games-is essential for enhancing gameplay and achieving balance. We have developed two advanced measures that extend beyond the simplistic win rate to quantify balance in zero-sum competitive scenarios. These measures are derived from win value estimations, which employ strength rating approximations via the Bradley-Terry model and counter relationship approximations via vector quantization, significantly reducing the computational complexity associated with traditional win value estimations. Throughout the learning process of these models, we identify useful categories of compositions and pinpoint their counter relationships, aligning with the experiences of human players without requiring specific game knowledge. Our methodology hinges on a simple technique to enhance codebook utilization in discrete representation with a deterministic vector quantization process for an extremely small state space. Our framework has been validated in popular online games, including Age of Empires II, Hearthstone, Brawl Stars, and League of Legends. The accuracy of the observed strength relations in these games is comparable to traditional pairwise win value predictions, while also offering a more manageable complexity for analysis. Ultimately, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of PvP game dynamics and present a methodology that significantly improves game balance evaluation and design.</description>

      <title>An Equilibrium Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model with Linear Programming Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic equilibrium transportation problem. There is a fixed number of cars moving from origin to destination areas. Preferences for arrival times are expressed as a cost of arriving before or after the preferred time at the destination. Each driver aims to minimize the time spent during the trip, making the time spent a measure of cost. The chosen routes and departure times impact the network loading. The goal is to find an equilibrium distribution across departure times and routes.
  For a relatively simplified transportation model we show that an equilibrium traffic distribution can be found as a solution to a linear program. In earlier works linear programming formulations were only obtained for social optimum dynamic traffic assignment problems. We also discuss algorithmic approaches for solving the equilibrium problem using time-expanded networks.</description>

      <title>With a little help from your friends: semi-cooperative games via Joker moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13417v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper coins the notion of Joker games where Player 2 is not strictly adversarial: Player 1 gets help from Player 2 by playing a Joker. We formalize these games as cost games, and study their theoretical properties. Finally, we illustrate their use in model-based testing.</description>

      <title>On Controlling Knockout Tournaments Without Perfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, extensive research has been conducted on the algorithmic aspects of designing single-elimination (SE) tournaments. Addressing natural questions of algorithmic tractability, we identify key properties of input instances that enable the tournament designer to efficiently schedule the tournament in a way that maximizes the chances of a preferred player winning. Much of the prior algorithmic work on this topic focuses on the perfect (complete and deterministic) information scenario, especially in the context of fixed-parameter algorithm design. Our contributions constitute the first fixed-parameter tractability results applicable to more general settings of SE tournament design with potential imperfect information.</description>
