      <title>Locating Ab Initio Transition States via Geodesic Construction on Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and reliable identification and optimization of transition state structures is a longstanding challenge in computational chemistry. Popular chain-of-states methods require hundreds if not thousands of \textit{ab initio} calculations to generate initial guesses for local quasi-Newton optimizers, with persistent risk of collapse to an alternative stationary point on the potential energy surface (PES). Here, we show that high-quality guess structures for transition state optimization can be obtained by constructing the geodesic path between reactant and product structures on the PES generated by machine learning potentials (MLPs). We present an algorithm for optimization of such geodesic paths, as well as the associated codebase. We demonstrate effectiveness of this approach using the recent eSEN-sm-cons MLP. On average, the highest-energy point along these MLP geodesics requires 30\% fewer quasi-Newton optimization steps to converge to the transition state compared to guesses from the fully \textit{ab initio} frozen string method. Our approach therefore completely eliminates the need for \textit{ab initio} calculations for generation of transition state guesses and considerably speeds up subsequent structural optimization. Geodesic construction on ML PES thus promises to be a useful approach for efficient computational elucidation of complex chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>On decoherence in surface hopping: the nonadiabaticity threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a strategy to efficiently and safely account for decoherence in the fewest switches surface hopping method. Standard decoherence corrections often lead to too strong coherence suppression. A simple and general solution to this problem is to restrict decoherence to regions of low nonadiabaticity measured by the dimensionless Massey parameter. The same threshold values are suitable for a variety of systems, regardless of their size and absolute energy scale. When restricted to uncoupled regions, a Gaussian overlap decoherence correction consistently leads to more accurate populations than using no correction. The article also examines under what circumstances it is appropriate to decohere instantaneously.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Construction of Compact Primitive Gaussian Density Fitting Basis Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present model-assisted density fitting (MADF) basis set generator, an algorithm for generating primitive atomic Gaussian density fitting (DF) basis sets (DFBSs) from a contracted Gaussian orbital basis set (OBS). The MADF algorithm produces DFBSs suitable for accurate robust DF approximation of 2-particle interactions in mean-field and correlated electronic structure. The algorithm is designed to (a) saturate the OBS product space by a large regularized set of primitive solid-harmonic Gaussian shells with nonuniform distribution of exponents followed by (b) pruning of the shells according to their contributions to the 2-body energy of a correlated atomic ensemble. Building the DFBS generator model almost exclusively on mathematical and physical principles allows one to limit the number of parameters that control the density fitting error to four, with a single set of parameters sufficient for computations with all basis cardinal numbers, with and without correlation of core electrons, with and without scalar and spin-dependent relativistic effects, spanning almost all of the Periodic Table. Performance assessment included basis sets up to quadruple-zeta quality from several major basis set families, using molecules composed of main-group, d-block, and f-block elements. The resulting DF errors in Hartree-Fock and second-order MP2 energies (with relativistic all-electron treatments, when appropriate) were on the order of 20 and 10 microhartree per electron, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for material characterization. However, careful preprocessing is required for the identification and handling of noise, baseline drift, and random spikes. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to generating and preprocessing Raman spectra. Additionally, we describe methods for fitting Voigt peaks to the spectrum to determine peak parameters. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using both synthetic and real Raman spectra, with code provided in an open-source GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Qubit encodings for lattices of dipolar planar rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near term quantum devices have recently garnered significant interest as promising candidates for investigating difficult-to-probe regimes in many-body physics. To this end, various qubit encoding schemes targeting second quantized Hamiltonians have been proposed and optimized. In this work, we investigate two qubit representations of the planar rotor lattice Hamiltonian. The first representation is realized by decomposing the rotor Hamiltonian projectors in binary and mapping them to spin-1/2 projectors. The second approach relies on embedding the planar rotor lattice Hilbert space in a larger space and recovering the relevant qubit encoded system as a quotient space projecting down to the physical degrees of freedom. This is typically called the unary mapping and is used for bosonic systems. We establish the veracity of the two encoding approaches using sparse diagonalization on small chains and discuss quantum phase estimation resource requirements to simulate small planar rotor lattices on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Molecular Properties in Quantum-Classical Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo: Correlated Sampling with Application to Accurate Nuclear Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend correlated sampling from classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to the quantum-classical (QC-AFQMC) framework, enabling accurate nuclear force computations crucial for geometry optimization and reaction dynamics. Stochastic electronic structure methods typically encounter prohibitive statistical noise when computing gradients via finite differences. To address this, our approach maximizes correlation between nearby geometries by synchronizing random number streams, aligning orbitals, using deterministic integral decompositions, and employing a consistent set of classical shadow measurements defined at a single reference geometry. Crucially, reusing this single, reference-defined shadow ensemble eliminates the need for additional quantum measurements at displaced geometries. Together, these methodological choices substantially reduce statistical variance in computed forces. We validate the method across hydrogen chains, confirming accuracy throughout varying correlation regimes, and demonstrate significant improvements over single-reference methods in force evaluations for N$_2$ and stretched linear H$_4$, particularly in strongly correlated regions where conventional coupled cluster approaches qualitatively fail. Orbital-optimized trial wave functions further boost accuracy for demanding cases such as stretched CO$_2$, without increasing quantum resource requirements. Finally, we apply our methodology to the MEA-CO$_2$ carbon capture reaction, employing quantum information metrics for active space selection and matchgate shadows for efficient overlap evaluations, establishing QC-AFQMC as a robust framework for exploring complex reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>How Soft is Too Soft? Tuning Order and Disorder in Dimeric Core-Soft Colloids with Bond Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations to explore how internal flexibility affects phase transitions in soft-matter systems composed of dimers interacting via a core-softened potential with two characteristic length scales. Monomers are connected by harmonic springs with varying stiffness, allowing us to tune the dimer rigidity from highly flexible to nearly rigid. Flexible dimers reproduce the behavior of monomeric systems, displaying well-defined BCC and HCP crystalline phases separated by a narrow amorphous region. As the bond stiffness increases, this amorphous phase gives way to a coexistence region between BCC and HCP structures. In the rigid limit, amorphous regions reemerge and expand, and high-density systems fail to crystallize completely, instead forming mixed phases with HCP-like and disordered local environments. This transition arises from geometric frustration: rigid dimers are unable to adjust their internal configuration to optimize local packing, thereby suppressing crystallization and promoting amorphization. Our findings reveal that bond flexibility is a key control parameter governing structural organization in core-softened colloidal and molecular systems, offering insights for the design of tunable soft materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50~meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of ionic currents in dilute electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the exponentially rare fluctuations of the ionic current for a dilute electrolyte by means of macroscopic fluctuation theory. We consider the fluctuating hydrodynamics of a fluid electrolyte described by a stochastic Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equations that dictate the optimal concentration profiles of ions conditioned on exhibiting a given current, whose form determines the likelihood of that current in the long-time limit. For a symmetric electrolyte under small applied voltages, number density fluctuations are small, and ionic current fluctuations are Gaussian with a variance determined by the Nernst-Einstein conductivity. Under large applied potentials, where number densities vary, the ionic current distribution is generically non-Gaussian. Its structure is constrained thermodynamically by Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry and the thermodynamic uncertainty principle.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes a protocol to study via Molecular Dynamics simulation the degradation of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in water by hydroxyl radical. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out, using ReaxFF reactive interaction potential.

Abstract: Bulk electrochemical phase transitions (EPTs) are the cornerstone of most modern electro-chemical technologies, underlying many energy storage and electrocatalytic systems. Nonetheless, the fundamental mechanisms governing EPTs in solid-to-solid systems re-main only partially understood because they involve complex interactions between phase transitions and electrochemical reactions. This mini-review introduces the thermodynam-ics of EPTs based on the general framework of phase transitions and mixtures, followed by a discussion of electrochemical hysteresis and kinetics in EPTs. Finally, using recent insights into the EPTS in Ni(OH)2, LiFePO4, and MnO2 materials, the importance of Cyclic Voltamme-try (CV) modelling in discerning underlying reaction mechanisms is highlighted. This mini-review inspires fundamental research into solid-to-solid EPTs for improving the perfor-mance of current energy storage materials.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>
