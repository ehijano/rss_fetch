      <title>Power partitions and Khinchin families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, within the probabilistic framework of Khinchin families, the Hardy--Ramanujan asymptotic formula for the number $p_k(n)$ of partitions of $n$ into $k$-th powers: \[ p_k(n) \sim \frac{\alpha_k}{n^{(3k+1)/(2k+2)}} \exp\!\bigl(\beta_k\, n^{1/(k+1)}\bigr), \quad n \to \infty, \] where $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ are explicit constants depending only on $k$. The argument reduces to verifying strong Gaussianity of the associated Khinchin family and computing \newline asymptotic approximations of its mean and variance.</description>

      <title>A note on the cooperative two-type SIR processes on Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard SIR model on a graph, infected vertices infect their neighbors at rate $\alpha$ and recover at rate $\mu$. We consider a two-type SIR process where each individual in the graph can be infected with two types of diseases, $A$ and $B$. Moreover, the two diseases interact in a cooperative way so that an individual that has been infected with one type of disease can acquire the other at a higher rate. We prove that if the underlying graph is a Galton-Watson tree and initially the root is infected with both $A$ and $B$, while all others are susceptible, then the two-type SIR model has the same critical value for the survival probability as the classic single-type model.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials on path-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the orthogonalisation of the signature of a stochastic process as the analogue of orthogonal polynomials on path-space. Under an infinite radius of convergence assumption, we prove density of linear functions on the signature in $L^p$ functions on grouplike elements, making it possible to represent a square-integrable function on (rough) paths as an $L^2$-convergent series. By viewing the shuffle algebra as commutative polynomials on the free Lie algebra, we revisit much of the theory of classical orthogonal polynomials in several variables, such as the recurrence relation and Favard's theorem. Finally, we restrict our attention to the case of Brownian motion with and without drift, and prove that dimension-independent orthogonal signature exists with drift but not without. We end with numerical examples of how orthogonal signature polynomials of Brownian motion can be applied for the approximation of functions on paths sampled from the Wiener measure.</description>

      <title>Stochastic invariance in infinite dimension beyond Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic invariance of closed subsets in Hilbert spaces for solutions to infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) under mild assumptions on the coefficients. Our first characterization is formulated in terms of certain normal vectors to the invariance set and requires differentiability only of the dispersion operator, but not of the diffusion coefficient itself. The condition involves a suitable corrected drift expressed through the dispersion operator and its Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, extending the classical Stratonovich correction term to the present low-regularity setting. Our second characterization is given in terms of the positive maximum principle for the infinitesimal generator of the associated diffusion process. We illustrate our characterizations in the case of invariant manifolds.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of discounted branching random walks via generic chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a discrete-time supercritical discounted branching random walk, in which increments at depth $k$ are independent and identically distributed with the same law as $m^{-kH}Y$, where $Y$ has a fixed law, $H&gt;0$, and $m&gt;1$ is the expected number of offspring at depth one. We provide a clean characterization of the boundedness of the discounted branching random walk: under mild conditions on the offspring distribution, the process is almost surely bounded if and only if $\mathbb{E}[|Y|^{1/H}]&lt;\infty$. This extends results of Athreya (1985) and A\"id\'ekon--Hu--Shi (2024), and provides a partial answer to Open Problem 31 of Aldous--Bandyopadhyay (2005).</description>

      <title>Geometric Large-Deviation-Type Principles for Mixed Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the large deviation principle for mixed measures associated with a class of $\log$-concave probability measures whose densities depend on the gauge function of a convex body. For convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we prove a geometric large-deviation-type asymptotic for first-order mixed measures, where the decay under dilation is governed by a natural inradius associated with the measure. In the planar case, we derive an explicit integral representation for second-order mixed measures and obtain a corresponding asymptotic. As an application, we prove a comparison theorem showing that asymptotic dominance under dilation forces inclusion between convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Estimates on Escape Times for the Elephant Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gambler's ruin problem for the Elephant Random Walk, focusing on escape time from a symmetric interval of the form $\{-N, \ldots, N\}$. As our main result, we derive tight exponential bounds for the tail of this escape time. We then illustrate the usefulness of such bounds by proving that, in the diffusive regime, the Elephant's average behavior mirrors that of the traditional symmetric random walk: the expected escape time grows quadratically with $N$.</description>

      <title>An Erd\H os R\'enyi Law for the Longest Consecutive Monotone Block in a Random Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18970</link>

Abstract: The Erd\H os-R\'enyi law states that given a sequence
  $\{X_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ of i.i.d.~($p$) coin-tosses, the longest run $L_n$ of heads in the first $n$ coin tosses approaches $\log_{1/p}n$ almost surely. In this paper we explore a formulation of this result in the case of random permutations and prove an Erd\H os-R\'enyi law for the longest consecutive monotone block in a random permutation.</description>

      <title>Limit Theory of the Multi-set Allocation Occupancy (MAO) Distribution: Normal and Poisson Approximations via MAO Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of the Multi-set Allocation Occupancy (MAO) distribution, which models the count vector $X=(X_{=0},\ldots,X_{=T})$ from $T$ independent rounds of sampling without replacement of size $m$ from $N$ individuals. Focusing on $X_{=t}$ (individuals in exactly $t$ subsets) and employing the MAO norm -- a combinatorial tool yielding closed-form factorial moments -- we derive the exact marginal distribution of a single individual as $\mathrm{Bin}(T,p)$ with $p=m/N$. Using the MAO norm, we prove that for any fixed number of distinct individuals, their joint distribution differs from the product of marginals by $O(1/N)$, establishing the weak dependence required for limit theorems. Based on these findings, we delineate two asymptotic regimes: 1. Normal approximation: When $N\to\infty$ with $p=m/N$ fixed, $X_{=t}$ obeys a central limit theorem and can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean $N\pi_t$ and variance obtained from the MAO norm, where $\pi_t = \binom{T}{t} p^t (1-p)^{T-t}$.2. Poisson approximation: When the expected value $\lambda_N := N\pi_t \to 0$, $X_{=t}$ converges in distribution to $\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda)$. By symmetry, if $\lambda_N \to N$, then $N-X_{=t}$ converges to a Poisson distribution. All theoretical results are rigorously proved via moment methods and are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations, which further demonstrate that the approximations remain valid even when the subset sizes are not equal. The MAO norm thus emerges as a unifying tool that connects the exact combinatorial structure of the model to its asymptotic theory. These findings offer clear guidance for choosing the appropriate approximation in practical applications, and they open the door to using the MAO distribution as a null model for detecting non random aggregation in fields as diverse as ecology, sociology, and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on the Sierpi\'nski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on the Sierpi\'nski gasket, a prototypical fractal graph that lacks translational invariance. The main novelty lies in incorporating Glauber dynamics, allowing for particle creation and annihilation with birth-death rates depending locally on the particle configuration. In the macroscopic limit, the particle density evolves according to a nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation, where the reaction term is explicitly determined by the microscopic rates. The key new ingredient is a replacement lemma adapted to the fractal geometry of the Sierpi\'nski gasket. We establish this lemma by deriving 1-block and 2-blocks estimates on the Sierpi\'nski gasket graph, which require new arguments due to the absence of classical lattice structures.</description>

      <title>Solving Poisson's equation for Wasserstein contractive Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Poisson's equation in the context of general state space Markov chains. For chains satisfying a contraction assumption w.r.t. a Wasserstein distance, we show that a solution exists for Lipschitz functions and investigate its regularity properties. If the kernel is additionally reversible we are also able to show that solutions for $L^p$ functions exist. Combining our findings with Doob's inequalities for martingales we derive maximal inequalities for contractive Markov chains. A number of examples is provided to demonstrate the applicability of our results, in particular in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Bakry-Emery Curvature of the Fractional Laplacian via Fractional Brownian Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first positive Bakry-'Emery curvature bound for a fractional Laplacian -- with and without drift -- resolving a case of the open problem of extending the $\Gamma_2$-calculus to non-local operators (Garofalo 2019, Spener-Weber-Zacher 2020).Our approach relies on a novel identification: the Fourier-space carr'e du champ of the $\gamma$-stable generator $L_\gamma = -(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}$ coincides with the covariance kernel of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H = \gamma/2$. On the torus $\mathbb{T}$, this reduces the curvature bound to a generalized eigenvalue problem. For the Cauchy process ($\gamma = 1$), the curvature spectrum consists of the odd integers, yielding the global bound $CD(1, \infty)$. Furthermore, we show $\gamma=1$ is the unique stability index admitting a strictly positive curvature bound $\kappa \geq 1$.Adding a confining potential $V(x) = -\omega^2 \cos x$, we analyze the L'evy-Fokker-Planck operator $L = -(-\Delta)^{1/2} - V'(x)\partial_x$. We prove the drift acts as a scalar shift on the curvature spectrum, yielding the global bound $CD(1 - \omega^2/2, \infty)$ for $\omega^2 &lt; 2$. This provides a Poincar'e inequality and gradient estimate for a non-diagonal operator with unknown spectrum, complementing known negative results that $(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ fails $CD(\kappa, N)$ for all finite $N$.</description>

      <title>Mean-field games with rough common noise I: the linear-quadratic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by mean-field games (MFG) with common noise on the one hand and pathwise stochastic control theory on the other, we formulate here a linear-quadratic (LQ) MFG with rough common noise, along with a satisfactory well-posedness theory for the linear-quadratic case. A novel Volterra-type (or mild) formulation allows to keep technical (rough-stochastic) consideration to a minimum. We derive a characterization of the optimal state and optimal control through a rough forward-backward SDE (rough FBSDE), and provide an existence and uniqueness result under the usual assumptions. Our theory is accompanied by stability estimates with respect to initial data and common noise while we also establish continuity of what we call the It\^o-Lions-Lyons map for rough mean-field games. Finally, we discuss randomization of the rough common noise under appropriate conditions on the coefficients. When the latter is given by the Stratonovich lift of a Brownian motion independent of the idiosyncratic noise, we show that solutions of the rough LQ MFG coincide with those obtained by conditioning on the common noise.</description>

      <title>A Class of Gaussian Fields on $\mathbb{Z}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian fields $(g_x)$ on $\mathbb{Z}_q^d$ are constructed from a class of reversible long range random walks $(X_t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}$ on $\mathbb{Z}_q^d$ in arXiv:2510.22554. The construction is from taking the covariance function of $(g_x)$ as $(1-\alpha)G(x,y;\alpha)$, where $G(x,y;\alpha)$ is the Green function of a random walk with killing in each transition at rate $1-\alpha$. A decomposition of the Gaussian field into a sum of independent Gaussian random variables is made. By letting $q\to \infty$ the Gaussian field becomes defined from an infinite-dimensional random walk on a torus. The random walk model is also extended to $d=\infty$ by considering a de Finetti random walk where entries in the increments of the random walk are exchangeable. A limit Gaussian field on $\mathbb{R}^d$ arises from a central limit theorem approach. The transform of this Gaussian field, which is again a Gaussian field, is calculated. It has a simpler covariance matrix than the original field. The Hamiltonian connected to the Gaussian field is calculated. A limit theorem for the partition function arising from the Hamiltonian is found.</description>

      <title>Sharp mixing time asymptotics of Glauber dynamics for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive a sharp mixing time estimate of the Glauber dynamics for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model in the low-temperature regime. In contrast to the high-temperature regime studied by Cuff et al. (J. Stat. Phys. 149: 432-477, 2012), in which the Gibbs measure is concentrated around the equiproportional distribution of spins, the Gibbs measure in the low-temperature regime is concentrated on multiple states, each with a dominant number of a single spin. Consequently, global mixing of the system requires sufficiently many transitions between these states. Since these transitions are well explained by the phenomenon of metastability, the theory of metastability plays a central role in the analysis of slow mixing. In particular, the sharp asymptotics for the mixing time is given by the mixing time of the limit Markov chain, which describes the metastable behavior of the dynamics, multiplied by the metastable transition time-scale. As a byproduct, we verify that it does not exhibit a cutoff phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Laplace Transforms of Stopping Times for Subordinator with Applications to Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittent demand fluctuations pose significant challenges in disaster logistics and medical supply systems. In this study, we formulate cumulative demand as a generalized L\'evy process composed of a drift term, Poisson jumps, and compound Poisson jumps, and analyze a continuous-time inventory model. The proposed framework provides a unified formulation that encompasses both drifted Poisson processes and drifted compound Poisson processes.
  From a mathematical perspective, we treat the reorder time as a first-passage problem of a subordinator and derive its Laplace transform via the Laplace exponent. In particular, for the drifted Poisson case, we obtain an explicit representation of the inverse Laplace exponent using the Lambert W function, which yields an analytic expression for the Laplace transform of the first-passage time. Furthermore, when the jump sizes follow exponential and Gamma distributions, we derive explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the reorder times, thereby clarifying the moment structure of first-passage times for generalized L\'evy demand processes.
  From an operations research perspective, we explicitly characterize the expected total cost over a finite time horizon based on the distribution of cumulative demand. This study presents an analytical framework that integrates first-passage theory of L\'evy processes with continuous-time inventory control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel procedure where a stationary point process is regularized through the convolution with a continuous random field with stationary increments, in the sense that the dependency between distant points is weakened; and the potential peaks in the spectrum (or Bragg peaks), reminiscent of a periodic behavior, are erased. We use this procedure to efficiently generate a hyperuniform point process in dimension 1 using a fractional Brownian Motion; simulating n points with complexity n log(n).</description>

      <title>The Contact Process Can Survive on a Slightly Subcritical Dynamical Percolation Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact process on dynamic edges (CPDE) is a contact process evolving on a dynamic environment given by a dynamical percolation on the edges of Z d\,: each edge updates its state to open or closed with respective rates vp and v(1 -p). By coupling a well-chosen subset of once infected sites in the CPDE with a cluster of some supercritical percolation on the edges of Z d , we prove that, for every dimension d $\ge$ 2, we can find some slightly subcritical p &lt; pc(d) such that for every update speed v &gt; 0, the contact process with large enough infection rate can survive. This extends the result for dimension 1 proved by Linker and Remenik in [LR20].</description>

      <title>Coalescing random walks via the coalescence determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When identical particles on a line collide, they merge and continue as one. Exact determinantal formulas have long been available for particles conditioned never to collide, but collisions change the number of particles, and exact distributions for the survivors have been obtained only in specific settings and by ad hoc methods. Building on the coalescence determinant introduced in a companion paper, we study the wall-particle system: the joint system of survivors and the boundaries between their basins of attraction, starting from every site occupied. Its finite-dimensional distributions are determinants of block matrices built from transition probabilities and their cumulative sums; a finite block matrix suffices even when the initial configuration is infinite. As applications, we recover the Rayleigh spacing density and the joint distribution of consecutive gaps-which are negatively correlated-by new methods, and give a new derivation of the determinantal formula for the joint CDF of finitely many coalescing particles starting from fixed positions. All formulas hold for arbitrary nearest-neighbor random walks and their Brownian scaling limits, with no specific transition kernels required.</description>

      <title>One polytope fits all: Characterization of the Euclidean ball via simultaneous intrinsic volume approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic best approximation of a smooth, strictly convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by inscribed polytopes with a restricted number of vertices under the intrinsic volume difference. We prove rigidity phenomena in both the deterministic and probabilistic settings. In the deterministic model of inscribed approximation, we show that if a single sequence of polytopes is asymptotically best for the volume and mean width difference simultaneously, then $K$ must be a Euclidean ball. In particular, the Euclidean ball is the unique $C_+^2$ convex body for which one sequence of polytopes can approximate all intrinsic volumes simultaneously at the optimal asymptotic rate.
  In the probabilistic model, we prove a stronger statement: if a single sampling density on $\partial K$ yields random inscribed polytopes that are asymptotically optimal (in expectation) for any two distinct intrinsic volume deviations, then $K$ must be a Euclidean ball. Moreover, using polarity, we establish dual versions of this rigidity theorem for polytopes circumscribed about $K$ (with a restricted number of facets) in the volume and mean width cases, again in both deterministic and probabilistic frameworks. The proofs use tools from asymptotic quantization theory together with the curvature-based optimal vertex distributions. These results resolve an open question posed by Besau, Hoehner and Kur ({\it IMRN}, 2021).</description>

      <title>Robust Predictive Uncertainty and Double Descent in Contaminated Bayesian Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a robust Bayesian formulation of random feature (RF) regression that accounts explicitly for prior and likelihood misspecification via Huber-style contamination sets. Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $\epsilon$- and $\eta$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification.</description>

      <title>Virtual Parameter Sharpening: Dynamic Low-Rank Perturbations for Inference-Time Reasoning Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I introduce Virtual Parameter Sharpening (VPS), an inference-time technique that augments frozen transformer linear layers with dynamic, activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, which learn static low-rank adapters, VPS constructs its perturbation factors on the fly from batch activation statistics and optional gradient signals, enabling test-time adaptation without persistent parameter updates. The perturbation takes the form Delta W = gamma * W^T V U^T W, where selector matrices U and V are constructed via sparse activation-guided selection or Sylvester-coupled regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's spectral properties and describe an adaptive policy system that modulates perturbation magnitude based on activation energy and token-level entropy. This system incorporates multi-objective verification with iterative refinement for tasks with ground-truth supervision. We present the complete algorithmic framework, analyze its mathematical foundations, and discuss the mechanisms by which activation-conditioned computation may enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models. Implementation and experimental code are available at https://github.com/Saba-Kublashvili/vps-virtual-parameter-synthesis .</description>

      <title>Schauder estimates for germs of distributions on smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss germs of distributions on $d-$dimensional smooth Riemannian manifolds and, in particular, we derive \emph{multi-level Schauder estimates} without making any further assumptions on the underlying geometry. As a preliminary step, we define the notions of coherence and homogeneity for germs of distributions on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 1$. Subsequently, we formulate both the reconstruction theorem, cf., [CZ20], and the Schauder estimates, cf., [BCZ24], in this setting. Leveraging the properties of the exponential map, we extend these results to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we devise a counterpart of the reconstruction theorem previously established in the literature [RS21], while additionally proving the regularity of the reconstructed distribution in suitable H\"older-Zygmund spaces. Finally, by introducing a novel concept of $\beta$-regularizing kernels on Riemannian manifolds, we establish Schauder estimates for coherent and homogeneous germs in this context.</description>

      <title>Constrained graph generation: Preserving diameter and clustering coefficient simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating graphs subject to strict structural constraints is a fundamental computational challenge in network science. Simultaneously preserving interacting properties-such as the diameter and the clustering coefficient- is particularly demanding. Simple constructive algorithms often fail to locate vanishingly small sets of feasible graphs, while traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers suffer from severe ergodicity breaking. In this paper, we propose a two-step hybrid framework combining Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and MCMC sampling. First, we design a layered ACO heuristic to perform a guided global search, effectively locating valid graphs with prescribed diameter and clustering coefficient. Second, we use these ACO-designed graphs as structurally distinct seed states for an MCMC rewiring algorithm. We evaluate this framework across a wide range of graph edge densities and varying diameter-clustering-coefficient constraint regimes. Using the spectral distance of the normalized Laplacian to quantify structural diversity of the resulting graphs, our experiments reveal a sharp contrast between the methods. Standard MCMC samplers remain rigidly trapped in an isolated subset of feasible graphs around their initial seeds. Conversely, our hybrid ACO-MCMC approach successfully bridges disconnected configuration landscapes, generating a vastly richer and structurally diverse set of valid graphs.</description>

      <title>Gradual smoothing: strong hypercontractivity and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of a gradual improvement as time progresses of the regularity of solutions to evolution problems of parabolic type driven by L\'evy operators, not necessarily translation invariant. In the course of our analysis we study the equivalence between general smoothing effects and a family of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. This equivalence allows us to identify a new type of regularization, strong hypercontractivity, characterized by the existence of a time at which solutions belong to every $L^p$ space with $p$ finite. It can also be used to prove logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in a context not previously seen in the literature. We then show that any purely nonlocal L\'evy operator whose kernel is comparable to that of $\log(I-\Delta)$ is strongly hypercontractive, but fails to be supercontractive and, consequently, also fails to be ultracontractive. Finally, in the translation-invariant case, we also prove that solutions get bounded eventually.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Random Network Distillation, Deep Ensembles, and Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.</description>

      <title>Large fluctuations of random multiplicative functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a Rademacher or Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For various arithmetically interesting subsets $\mathcal A\subseteq [1, N]\cap\mathbb N$ such that the distribution of $\sum_{n\in \mathcal A} f(n)$ is approximately Gaussian, we develop a general framework to understand the large fluctuations of the sum. This extends the general central limit theorem framework of Soundararajan and Xu.
  In the case when $\mathcal A = (N-H, N]$ is a short interval with admissible $H=H(N)$, we show that almost surely \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{N-H&lt;n\leq N} f(n)\big\rvert}{\sqrt{H\log \frac{N}H{}}}&gt;0. \end{equation*} When $\mathcal A$ is the set of values of an admissible polynomial $P\in\mathbb Z[x]$, we extend work of Klurman, Shkredov, and Xu, as well as Chinis and the author, showing that almost surely \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{n\leq N} f(P(n))\big\rvert}{\sqrt{N \log\log N}}&gt;0, \end{equation*} even when $P$ is a product of linear factors over $\mathbb Q$. In this case, we also establish the corresponding almost sure upper bound, matching the law of iterated logarithm.
  An important ingredient in our work is bounding the Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance by means of a quantitative martingale central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>On a discrete max-plus transportation problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit algorithm to solve the idempotent analogue of the discrete Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transportation problem with the usual real number field replaced by the tropical (max-plus) semiring, in which addition is defined as the maximum and product is defined as usual addition, with minus infinity and zero playing the roles of additive and multiplicative identities. Such a problem may be naturally called tropical or "max-plus" optimal transportation problem. We show that the solutions to the latter, called the optimal tropical plans, may not correspond to perfect matchings even if the data (max-plus probability measures) have all weights equal to zero, in contrast with the classical discrete optimal transportation analogue, where perfect matching optimal plans in similar situations always exist. Nevertheless, in some randomized situation the existence of perfect matching optimal tropical plans may occur rather frequently. At last, we prove that the uniqueness of solutions of the optimal tropical transportation problem is quite rare.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth, stationary Gaussian field $f$ on Euclidean space with fast correlation decay, there is a critical level $\ell_c$ such that the excursion set $\{f\geq\ell\}$ contains a (unique) unbounded component if and only if $\ell&lt;\ell_c$. We prove central limit theorems for the volume, surface area and Euler characteristic of this unbounded component restricted to a growing box. For planar fields, the results hold at all supercritical levels (i.e. all $\ell&lt;\ell_c$). In higher dimensions the results hold at all sufficiently low levels (all $\ell&lt;-\ell_c&lt;\ell_c$) but could be extended to all supercritical levels by proving the decay of truncated connection probabilities. Our proof is based on the martingale central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous random matrices with non-trivial variance profiles determined by symmetric stochastic matrices and with independent sub-Gaussian entries up to Hermitian symmetry, encompass a wide range of important models, including sparse Wigner matrices and random band matrices. In these models, the maximum entry variance-a natural proxy for sparsity-serves both as a key structural feature and a primary analytical obstacle. In this paper, we consider low-rank additive perturbations of such matrices and establish a sharp BBP phase transition for extreme eigenvalues at the level of the law of large numbers. Furthermore, in the Gaussian setting, we derive the fluctuations of spectral outliers under suitable conditions on the variance profile and perturbation. These fluctuations exhibit strong non-universality, depending on the eigenvectors, sparsity levels, and the underlying geometric structure. Our proof strategies rely on ribbon graph expansions, upper bounds for diagram functions, large-moment estimates, and the enumeration of typical diagrams.</description>

      <title>Extremal eigenvectors of sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of sparse random matrices, which includes the adjacency matrix of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph ${\bf G}(N,p)$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that the non-trivial edge eigenvectors are asymptotically jointly normal. The main ingredient of the proof is an algorithm that directly computes the joint eigenvector distributions, without comparisons with GOE. The method is applicable in general. As an illustration, we also use it to prove the normal fluctuation in quantum ergodicity at the edge for Wigner matrices. Another ingredient of the proof is the isotropic local law for sparse matrices, which at the same time improves several existing results.</description>

      <title>The coalescent structure of multitype continuous-time Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the genealogy of a sample of $k&gt;1$ particles, taken under various sampling schemes, from the population alive at fixed times, in a continuous-time multitype Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson (MBGW) tree with finite second moments. For critical MBGW trees under uniform sampling without replacement, we show that the sample genealogy converges in the large time limit to a universal limiting structure with the same tree topology as Kingman's coalescent but enriched by a nontrivial process coding the types along each lineage. Remarkably, the limiting genealogy is robust to the sampling scheme: it remains unchanged when fixing type configurations (that is, if we sample uniformly at random without replacement given a fixed vector of types to sample), or sampling with type-dependent weights (that is, multinomial sampling over types). Tracking types along the genealogy reveals that, in the limit, types evolve independently of the tree structure but retain a distribution determined by the offspring law, and the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalues. For uniform sampling without replacement, we use $k$ distinguished \emph{spine} particles and a suitable change of measure under which, when sampling at fixed times: (a) the spines form a uniform sample without replacement that depend on the types, and (b) there is $k$-size biasing and discounting according to the population size. This work substantially extends the spine techniques developed by Harris, Johnston, and Roberts 2020 and Harris, Johnston, and Pardo 2024, for the single-type case. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of how type information affects functionals of the spines. We show that the multitype case introduces complex interactions between types, resulting in a richer dependency structure where functionals must capture type-specific behaviours and inter-type correlations.</description>

      <title>Empirical Measures and Strong Laws of Large Numbers in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Glivenko--Cantelli theorem is a uniform version of the strong law of large numbers. It states that for every IID sequence of random variables, the empirical measure converges to the underlying distribution (in the sense of uniform convergence of the CDF). In this work, we provide tools to study such limits of empirical measures in categorical probability. We propose two axioms, namely permutation invariance and empirical adequacy, that a morphism of type $X^{\mathbb{N}} \to X$ should satisfy to be interpretable as taking an infinite sequence as input and producing a sample from its empirical measure as output. Since not all sequences have a well-defined empirical measure, such \emph{empirical sampling morphisms} live in quasi-Markov categories, which, unlike Markov categories, allow for partial morphisms.
  Given an empirical sampling morphism and a few other properties, we prove representability as well as abstract versions of the de Finetti theorem, the Glivenko--Cantelli theorem and the strong law of large numbers.
  We provide several concrete constructions of empirical sampling morphisms as partially defined Markov kernels on standard Borel spaces. Instantiating our abstract results then recovers the standard Glivenko--Cantelli theorem and the strong law of large numbers for random variables with finite first moment. Our work thus provides a joint proof of these two theorems in conjunction with the de Finetti theorem from first principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any log-concave random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with mean zero and identity covariance, $$ \mathbb{E} (|X| - \sqrt{n})^2 \leq C $$ where $C &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Thus, most of the mass of the random vector $X$ is concentrated in a thin spherical shell, whose width is only $C / \sqrt{n}$ times its radius. This confirms the thin-shell conjecture in high dimensional convex geometry. Our method relies on the construction of a certain coupling between log-affine perturbations of the law of $X$ related to Eldan's stochastic localization and to the theory of non-linear filtering. Another ingredient is a recent breakthrough technique by Guan that was previously used in our proof of Bourgain's slicing conjecture, which is known to be implied by the thin-shell conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study line ensembles arising naturally in symmetrized/half-space geometric last passage percolation (LPP) on the $N \times N$ square. The weights of the model are geometrically distributed with parameter $q^2$ off the diagonal and $cq$ on the diagonal, where $q \in (0,1)$ and $c \in [0, q^{-1})$. In the supercritical regime $c &gt; 1$, we show that the ensembles undergo a phase transition: the top curve separates from the rest and converges to a Brownian motion under $N^{1/2}$ fluctuations and $N$ spatial scaling, while the remaining curves converge to the Airy line ensemble under $N^{1/3}$ fluctuations and $N^{2/3}$ spatial scaling. Our analysis relies on a distributional identity between half-space LPP and the Pfaffian Schur process. The latter exhibits two key structures: (1) a Pfaffian point process, which we use to establish finite-dimensional convergence of the ensembles, and (2) a Gibbsian line ensemble, which we use to extend convergence uniformly over compact sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the multivariate risk model with common renewal process among the lines of business, and Brownian perturbations. Assuming that the integrated tail distribution of claims is multivariate subexponential, we establish an asymptotic relation for the infinite-time ruin probability. A more explicit expression is given in case of claim distribution from multivariate regular variation. The results indicate the insensitivity of the asymptotic behavior of the ruin probability with respect to Brownian perturbations. Furthermore, we show that a multivariate distribution with finite expectation, that belongs to the class of multivariate dominatedly varying and long-tailed distributions, possesses integrated tail distribution from the class of multivariate subexponential distributions, which makes easier the checking of conditions in the theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the Weingarten calculus by employing the notion of virtual isometries. Traditionally, Weingarten calculus provides explicit formulas for integrating polynomial functions over compact matrix groups with respect to the Haar measure, yet it faces limitations when evaluating high-degree integrals due to the non-invertibility of the associated matrices. We revisit these classical computations from a new perspective: by constructing Haar-distributed matrices as products of sequences of complex reflections, we derive new recursive structures for the Weingarten functions across different dimensions. This framework leads to two main results: (1) an explicit Weingarten calculus for complex reflections, yielding systematic moment computations for associated rank-one matrices, and (2) a novel convolution formula that connects Weingarten functions in dimension $n$ to those in dimension $n-1$, through the introduction of ascension functions in the symmetric group algebra. Our approach not only provides a unified treatment for unitary groups, but also sheds light on the algebraic and probabilistic aspects of high-degree integral computations. We present several examples and applications.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the Langevin dynamics of inertial particles being transported by a background flow. In particular, we study an acceleration corrected advection-diffusion approximation to the Langevin dynamics, a popular approximation in the study of turbulent transport. We prove error estimates in the averaging regime in which the dimensionless relaxation timescale $\varepsilon$ is the small parameter. We show that for any finite time interval, the approximation error is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ in the strong sense and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ in the weak sense, whose optimality is checked against computational experiment. Furthermore, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this approximation also captures the long-time behavior of the Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Distributional Limits for Eigenvalues of Graphon Kernel Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuation behavior of individual eigenvalues of kernel matrices arising from dense graphon-based random graphs. Under minimal integrability and boundedness assumptions on the graphon, we establish distributional limits for simple, well-separated eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. A sharp probabilistic dichotomy emerges: in the non-degenerate regime, the properly normalized empirical eigenvalue satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit variance, whereas in the degenerate regime the leading stochastic term vanishes and the centered eigenvalue converges to a weighted chi-square law determined by the operator spectrum.
  The analysis requires no smoothness or Lipschitz conditions on the kernel. Prior work under comparable assumptions established only operator convergence and eigenspace consistency; the present results characterize the full distributional behavior of individual eigenvalues, extending fluctuation theory beyond the reach of classical operator-level arguments. The proofs combine second-order perturbation expansions, concentration bounds for kernel matrices, and Hoeffding decompositions for symmetric statistics, revealing that at the $\sqrt{n}$ scale the dominant randomness arises from latent-position sampling rather than Bernoulli edge noise.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the following stochastic wave equation on the real line $\partial_t^2 u_{\alpha}=\partial_x^2 u_{\alpha}+b\left(u_\alpha\right)+\sigma\left(u_\alpha\right)\eta_{\alpha}$. The noise $\eta_\alpha$ is white in time and colored in space with a covariance structure $\mathbb{E}[\eta_\alpha(t,x)\eta_\alpha(s,y)]=\delta(t-s)f_\alpha(x-y)$ where $f_\alpha$ is continuous with respect to $\alpha$ in Fourier mode, see assumption 1.2. We prove the continuity of the probability measure induced by the solution $u_\alpha$, in terms of $\alpha$, with respect to the convergence in law in the topology of continuous functions with uniform metric on compact sets. We also give several examples of $f_\alpha$ such that our theorem applies to.</description>

      <title>Largest gaps between bulk eigenvalues of unitary-invariant random Hermitian matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $n\times n$ random Hermitian matrix ensembles that are invariant under unitary conjugation. Let $I$ be a finite union of intervals lying in the bulk, and let $m_{k}^{(n)}$ be the $k$-th largest gap between consecutive eigenvalues lying in $I$. We prove that the rescaled gap $\smash{\tau_{k}^{(n)}}$, which is defined by \begin{align*} m_{k}^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi \inf_{I}\rho} \bigg( \frac{\sqrt{32 \log n}}{n} + \frac{3q-8}{2q} \frac{ \log(2\log n)}{n \sqrt{2\log n}} + \frac{4\tau_{k}^{(n)}}{n \sqrt{2\log n}} \bigg), \end{align*} converges in distribution as $n\to +\infty$ to a gamma-Gumbel random variable that is shifted by an explicit constant $c_{V,I}$ depending only on $I$ and on the potential $V$. Here $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure and $q\in \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$ is the highest order at which $\rho(x)$ approaches $\inf_{I}\rho$ with $x\in I$; for example, if $\rho(x)=1/(\pi\sqrt{x(1-x)})$, then $q=2$ if $\frac{1}{2}\in \overline{I}$ and $q=1$ otherwise. This work extends a result of Feng and Wei beyond the Gaussian potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish local laws for sample covariance matrices $K = N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N \g_i\g_i^*$ where the random vectors $\g_1, \ldots, \g_N \in \R^n$ are independent with common covariance $\Sigma$. Previous work has largely focused on the separable model $\g = \Sigma^{1/2}\w$ with $\w$ having independent entries, but this structure is rarely present in statistical applications involving dependent or nonlinearly transformed data. Under a concentration assumption for quadratic forms $\g^*A\g$, we prove an optimal averaged local law showing that the Stieltjes transform of $K$ converges to its deterministic limit uniformly down to the optimal scale $\eta \geq N^{-1+\eps}$. Under an additional structural assumption on the cumulant tensors of $\g$ -- which interpolates between the highly structured case of independent entries and generic dependence -- we establish the full anisotropic local law, providing entrywise control of the resolvent $(K-zI)^{-1}$ in arbitrary directions. We discuss several classes of non-separable examples satisfying our assumptions, including conditionally mean-zero distributions, the random features model $\g = \sigma(X\w)$ arising in machine learning, and Gaussian measures with nonlinear tilting. The proofs introduce a tensor network framework for analyzing fluctuation averaging in the presence of higher-order cumulant structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look at Monte Carlo numerical integration from a stochastic geometry point of view. While crude Monte Carlo estimators relate to linear statistics of a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), linear statistics of more regularly spread point processes can yield unbiased estimators with faster-decaying variance, and thus lower integration error. Following this intuition, we introduce a Coulomb repulsion operator, which reduces clustering by slightly pushing the points of a configuration away from each other. Our empirical findings show that applying the repulsion operator to a PPP as well as, intriguingly, to more regular point processes, preserves unbiasedness while reducing the variance of the corresponding Monte Carlo estimator, thus enhancing the method. We prove this variance reduction when the initial point process is a PPP. On the computational side, the complexity of the operator is quadratic and the corresponding algorithm can be parallelized without communication across tasks.</description>

      <title>A spectral mixture representation of isotropic kernels with application to random Fourier features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rahimi and Recht (2007) introduced the idea of decomposing positive definite shift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution for machine learning applications. This famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable to any such kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian. Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader classes of kernels. In this paper, we show that the spectral distribution of positive definite isotropic kernels in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for all $d\geq1$ can be decomposed as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors, and we identify the mixing distribution as a function of the kernel. This constructive decomposition provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for many multivariate positive definite shift-invariant kernels, including exponential power kernels, and generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the generalized Mat\'ern, Tricomi, and Fox $H$ kernels. In particular, we retrieve the fact that the spectral distributions of these kernels, which can only be explicited in terms of the Fox $H$ special function, are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution, along with an explicit mixing distribution formula. This result has broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>

      <title>Smile asymptotics for Bachelier implied volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the implied volatility in the Bachelier setting, extending the large-strike results established for the Black-Scholes framework. Exploiting the theory of regular variation, we derive explicit expressions for the Bachelier implied volatility in the wings of the smile, directly linking them to the tail decay of the underlying returns' distribution. Furthermore, we establish a rigorous connection between the analyticity strip of the characteristic function and the asymptotic slope of the volatility smile. Moreover, we show that if the implied variance grows linearly for large absolute moneyness degree, the underlying returns' distribution must exhibit exponential tail decay, and the corresponding characteristic function is analytic in a horizontal strip of the complex plane. These findings characterizes valid models based solely on the observable asymptotic behaviour of the smile.</description>

      <title>Khintchine dichotomy and Schmidt estimates for self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical theorems of Khintchine and Schmidt in metric Diophantine approximation to the context of self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. For this, we establish effective equidistribution of associated random walks on $\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{Z})$. This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough.
  Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence. Along the way, we also establish non-concentration properties of self-similar measures near algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Multipole and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions in the Two-component Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional two-component Coulomb gas in the canonical ensemble and at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;2$. In this regime, the partition function diverges and the interaction needs to be cut off at a length scale $\lambda\in (0,1)$. Particles of opposite charges tend to pair into dipoles of length scale comparable to $\lambda$, which themselves can aggregate into multipoles. Despite the slow decay of dipole--dipole interactions, we construct a convergent cluster expansion around a hierarchical reference model that retains only intra-multipole interactions. This yields a large deviations result for the number of $2p$-poles as well as a sharp free energy expansion as $N\to\infty$ and $\lambda\to0$ with three contributions: (i) the free energy of $N$ independent dipoles, (ii) a perturbative correction, and (iii) the contribution of a non-dilute subsystem.
  The perturbative term has two equivalent characterizations: (a) a convergent Mayer series obtained by expanding around an i.i.d.\ dipole model; and (b) a variational formula as the minimum of a large-deviation rate function for the empirical counts of $2p$-poles. The Mayer coefficients exhibit transitions at $\beta_p=4-\tfrac{2}{p}$, that accumulate at $\beta=4$, which corresponds to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the low-dipole-density limit. At $\beta=\beta_p$ the $p$-dipole cluster integrals switch from non-integrable to integrable tails.
  The non-dilute system corresponds to the contribution of large dipoles: we exhibit a new critical length scale $R_{\beta, \lambda}$ which transitions from $\lambda^{-(\beta-2)/(4-\beta)}$ to $+\infty$ as $\beta$ crosses the critical inverse temperature $\beta=4$, and which can be interpreted as the maximal scale such that the dipoles of that scale form a dilute set.</description>

      <title>Locally integrable cross sections and their intersection covolume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study systematically cross sections of probability preserving actions of unimodular groups and their associated transverse measures, and introduce the invariant \emph{intersection covolume} to quantify their periodicity. Our main theorem, derived from a higher order version of Kac's lemma, shows that the intersection covolume is bounded below by the intensity, with equality precisely when the action is induced by a lattice (in the sense of Mackey). We further prove that the natural cross sections of cut--and--project actions have finite intersection covolume.</description>

      <title>Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) of a stochastic signal to a threshold is a fundamental observable across physics, biology, and finance. While renewal shot noise is a canonical model for such signals, analytical results for its FPT have remained confined to the Poisson (Markovian) case, despite the prevalence of non-Poisson arrival statistics in applications from neuronal spiking to gene expression. We break this long-standing barrier by deriving the first universal asymptotic formula for the mean FPT $\langle T_b \rangle$ to reach level $b$ for renewal shot noise with general arrival statistics and exponential marks. Our central result is a closed-form expression that reveals precisely how general inter-arrival statistics impact the naive Arrhenius law. We show that the short-time behavior of the interarrival distribution dictates universal scaling corrections, ranging from stretched-exponential to algebraic, that can dramatically accelerate threshold crossing. Furthermore, we show analytically and confirm numerically that the full FPT distribution becomes exponential at large thresholds, implying that $\langle T_b \rangle$ provides a complete asymptotic characterization. Our work, enabled by a novel exact solution for the moments of the noise, establishes a general framework for analyzing extreme events in non-Markovian systems with relaxation.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Asymptotics of Differentially Private PCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy, random noise is introduced to privatize summary statistics of a sensitive dataset before releasing them. The noise level determines the privacy loss, which quantifies how easily an adversary can detect a target individual's presence in the dataset using the published statistic. Most privacy analyses provide upper bounds on the privacy loss. Sometimes, these bounds offer weak privacy guarantees unless the noise level is so high that it overwhelms the meaningful signal. It is unclear whether such high noise levels are necessary or a limitation of loose and pessimistic privacy bounds. This paper explores whether it is possible to obtain sharp privacy characterizations that determine the exact privacy loss of a mechanism on a given dataset. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis (PCA), where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components of a dataset with $n$ samples and $p$ features. We analyze the exponential mechanism in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p \rightarrow \infty$). We show that in high dimensions, detecting a target individual's presence using privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing between two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with Le Cam's contiguity arguments.</description>

      <title>The stochastic six vertex model and discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class exhibit remarkable fluctuation phenomena. While a variety of powerful methods have led to a detailed understanding of their typical fluctuations or large deviations, much less is known about behavior on intermediate, or moderate deviation, scales. Addressing this problem requires refined asymptotic control of the integrable structures underlying KPZ models.
  Motivated by this perspective, we study multiplicative statistics of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles (dOPEs) in different scaling regimes, with a particular focus on applications to tail probabilities of the height function in the stochastic six-vertex model. For a large class of dOPEs, we obtain robust singular asymptotic estimates for multiplicative statistics critically scaled near a saturated-to-band transition. These asymptotics exhibit universal crossover behavior, interpolating between Airy, Painlev\'e II, and Bessel-type regimes. Our proofs employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem (RHP) approach to obtain asymptotics for the correlation kernel of a deformed version of the dOPE across the critical scaling windows. These asymptotics are then used on a double integral formula relating this kernel to partition function ratios, which may be of independent interest. At the technical level, the RHP analysis employs a novel parameter-dependent local parametrix, which requires a separate asymptotic analysis of its own.
  Using these results, together with a known identity relating a Laplace-type transform of the stochastic six-vertex model height function to a multiplicative statistic of the Meixner point process, we derive moderate deviation estimates for the height function in both the upper and lower tail regimes, with sharp exponents and constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel framework for density estimation under expectation constraints is proposed. The framework minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the estimated density and a prior, subject to the constraints that the expected value of a set of functions adopts or exceeds given values. The framework is generalized to include regularization inequalities to mitigate the artifacts in the target measure. An annealing-like algorithm is developed to address non-smooth constraints, with its effectiveness demonstrated through both synthetic and proof-of-concept real world examples in finance.</description>

      <title>Stability of the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality for the Lebesgue and Gaussian probability measures with explicit geometric dependence and applications to spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain stability results for the $L^p$-Poincar\'e inequality for both Lebesgue and Gaussian probability measures (Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.12) that involve explicit dependence on the geometry of the domain. As a byproduct, the explicit constant allows us to recover an important result of Yu, Zhong and Smits (Corollary 3.8), related to the fundamental gap conjecture of the Laplacian (resolved by Andrews and Clutterbuck), thereby providing an alternative proof. Moreover, we extend this spectral gap result to the $p$-Laplacian (Corollary 3.6). Our approach relies on properties of the first eigenfunction of the (Gaussian) $p$ Laplacian operator and weighted Poincar\'e inequalities for log-concave measures on convex domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is shelf-shuffled exactly one time. One after the other a single card is drawn from the shuffled deck. The guesser makes has guess and the card is shown until no cards remain. We provide a distributional analysis of the number of correct guesses under the optimal strategy. We re-obtain the previously derived expectation and add a complete description of the distribution. We also obtain a central limit theorem for the number $n$ of cards tending to infinity. Furthermore, we discuss an unbalanced, biased shelf shuffle and show how to derive the extend our analysis, also adding the complete position matrix. Finally, a refined analysis of the number of correct guesses is carried out, distinguishing between pure luck guesses and certified correct guesses.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a geometric duality between the spherical squared-Hellinger distance and a hyperbolic isometric invariant of the Poincare disc under the action of the general Mobius group. Motivated by the geometric connection, we propose the usage of the L2-embedded hyperbolic isometric invariant as an alternative way to quantify divergence between Gaussian measures as a contribution to information theory.</description>
