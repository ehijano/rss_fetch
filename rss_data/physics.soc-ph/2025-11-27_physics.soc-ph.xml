      <title>City-level energy and emission assessment of over 20 million electric vehicle registrations in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: China, the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) market, plays a pivotal role in global transport decarbonization. We present the first high-resolution assessment of EV low-carbon development across 295 cities, using over 20 million registrations of 586 models from 2022-2024, and projects transition pathways to 2035. Real-world data reveal that EVs are 30.9212.8 megajoules per 100 kilometers more energy-efficient than internal combustion vehicles, yet carbon intensity varies widely-from 18.2 to 270.4 gCO2/kilometer across provinces. Despite rapid electrification, gasoline still accounts for 44% of EV energy use, underscoring the limited electrification of hybrids. Scenario projections suggest emissions will peak around 2030 at 21.1-30.9 MtCO2, declining by 2035 with solid-state battery deployment and stronger policies. These findings establish an empirical foundation for accurate emission accounting, emphasize the need to reduce regional disparities, and offer globally relevant insights to accelerate deep-decarbonization in transport.</description>

      <title>AI4X Roadmap: Artificial Intelligence for the advancement of scientific pursuit and its future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we approach scientific discovery, not by replacing established methods but by extending what researchers can probe, predict, and design. In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>A Network Dynamical Systems Approach to SDGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a complex, interdependent framework where progress in one area can synergistically promote or competitively inhibit progress in others. For policymakers in international development, a critical challenge is identifying "leverage points" - specific goals where limited resource allocation yields the maximum system-wide benefit. This study addresses this challenge by modeling the SDGs as a Networked Dynamical System (NDS). Using empirical data from Our World in Data (2018), we construct a weighted interaction network of 16 SDG indicators. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression to derive coupling weights empirically. Unlike previous static analyses, we simulate the temporal evolution of development indicators using an extended Lotka-Volterra model. To ensure numerical stability and sophistication, we upgrade the simulation method from standard Euler integration to the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method. Our simulation, applied to a case study of Mexico, reveals that SDG 4 (Quality Education) acts as a critical driver, suggesting that prioritizing education yields the most significant positive spillover effects across the development network. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis and explore the power-law relationship between investment and stability.</description>

      <title>The Intertwined Rise of Collaboration Scale, Reference Diversity, and Breakthrough Potential in Modern Science: A 40-Year Cross-Disciplinary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last four decades, the way knowledge is created in academia has transformed dramatically: research teams have grown larger, scholars draw from ever-wider pools of prior work, and the most influential discoveries increasingly emerge from complex collaborative efforts. Using a massive dataset of over 15 million publications spanning 1970-2010 and covering six major domains (Humanities, Social Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences, Engineering and Technology, and Natural Sciences), this study tracks how three core features of scientific papers - authorship team size, the breadth and variety of cited sources, and eventual citation impact - have co-evolved over time. We uncover striking differences across disciplines. In every field, papers that build on a broader and more diverse knowledge base consistently attract more citations later on, lending large-scale empirical support to theories that view scientific breakthroughs as outcomes of novel recombination across distant ideas. Bigger teams, on average, generate work with greater ultimate influence, but the gains taper off after a certain scale; very large consortia seldom produce the absolute highest-impact papers. While the Humanities and Social Sciences remain anchored in solo or small-group authorship traditions, the Natural Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering have moved decisively toward big-team mega-science. These patterns illuminate the underlying production technology of discovery, reveal discipline-specific barriers to collaboration and idea integration, and offer evidence-based guidance for research funding agencies, universities, and policymakers seeking to organize scientific work for maximum breakthrough potential.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solution of a general three-term recurrence relation: applications to Heun functions and social choice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a concise closed-form solution for a linear three-term recurrence relation. Such recurrence relations are very common in the quantitative sciences, and describe finite difference schemes, solutions to problems in Markov processes and quantum mechanics, and coefficients in the series expansion of Heun functions and other higher-order functions. Our solution avoids the usage of continued fractions and relies on a linear algebraic approach that makes use of the properties of lower-triangular and tridiagonal matrices, allowing one to express the terms in the recurrence relation in closed-form in terms of a finite set of orthogonal polynomials. We pay particular focus to the power series coefficients of Heun functions, which are often found as solutions in eigenfunction problems in quantum mechanics and general relativity and have also been found to describe time-dependent dynamics in both biology and economics. Finally, we apply our results to find equations describing the relaxation times to steady state behaviour in social choice models.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Unified Model of Community Formation in Community-Supported Agriculture: Insights from Consumer and Producer Pathways in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) has been recognized globally as a promising framework that embeds agriculture within social relations, yet its diffusion remains limited in contexts such as Japan. Existing studies have largely focused on either consumer or producer participation in isolation, offering fragmented insights and leaving unexplored how their reciprocal processes jointly shape CSA communities. This study addresses this gap by integrating the trajectories of both groups into a comprehensive account of CSA community formation. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with ten CSA producers and ten consumers, we employed the Modified Grounded Theory Approach (M-GTA) to inductively theorize processes of participation and practice. The analysis showed that producers advance CSA through internal adjustments and sense-making to cope with uncertainties, while consumers are guided by life events, practical skills, and prior purchasing experiences toward participation. Synthesizing these insights, we propose a six-phase model of CSA community formation, dispersed interest, awareness, interest formation, motivation, practice, and co-creative continuation, that demonstrates how producers, consumers, and intermediaries interact across stages. The model highlights the pivotal role of key players in sustaining engagement and provides a new perspective for institutionalizing CSA as a durable component of sustainable food systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</description>

      <title>Control strategies and trends to equilibrium for kinetic models of opinion dynamics driven by social activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new kinetic equations modeling opinion dynamics inside a population of individuals, whose propensity to interact with each other is described by their level of social activity. We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker--Planck equation with degenerate time-dependent coefficients.</description>
