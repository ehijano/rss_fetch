      <title>Flat braid groups, right-angled Artin groups, and commensurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $n\geq 1$, the flat braid group $\mathrm{FB}_n$ is an analogue of the braid group $B_n$ that can be described as the fundamental group of the configuration space $$\left\{ \{x_1, \ldots, x_n \} \in \mathbb{R}^n / \mathrm{Sym}(n) \mid \text{there exist at most two indices $i,j$ such that } x_i=x_j \right\}.$$ Alternatively, $\mathrm{FB}_n$ can also be described as the right-angled Coxeter group $C(P_{n-2}^\mathrm{opp})$, where $P_{n-2}^\mathrm{opp}$ denotes the opposite graph of the path $P_{n-2}$ of length $n-2$. In this article, we prove that, for every $n= 7$ or $\geq 11$, $\mathrm{PFB}_n$ is not virtually a right-angled Artin group, disproving a conjecture of Naik, Nanda, and Singh. In the opposite direction, we observe that $\mathrm{FB}_7$ turns out to be commensurable to the right-angled Artin group $A(P_4)$.</description>

      <title>Dehn filling in semisimple Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize one part of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn filling theorem to arbitrary-rank semisimple Lie groups by showing that certain deformations of extended geometrically finite subgroups of a semisimple Lie group are still extended geometrically finite. As a special case, our theorem gives a criterion which guarantees that a deformation of a relatively Anosov subgroup is (non-relatively) Anosov, and also ensures that limit sets vary continuously. Our result also applies to several higher-rank examples in convex projective geometry which are outside of the relatively Anosov setting.</description>

      <title>Connectivity for square percolation and coarse cubical rigidity in random right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random right-angled Coxeter groups, $W_{\Gamma}$, whose presentation graph $\Gamma$ is taken to be an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph, i.e., $\Gamma\sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$. We use techniques from probabilistic combinatorics to establish several new results about the geometry of these random groups.
  We resolve a conjecture of Susse and determine the connectivity threshold for square percolation on the random graph $\Gamma \sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$. We use this result to determine a large range of $p$ for which the random right-angled Coxeter group $W_{\Gamma}$ has a unique cubical coarse median structure. Until recent work of Fioravanti, Levcovitz and Sageev, there were no non-hyperbolic examples of groups with cubical coarse rigidity; our present results show the property is in fact typically satisfied by a random RACG for a wide range of the parameter $p$, including $p=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>

      <title>The Diophantine problem in Thompson's group F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Diophantine problem in Thompson's group F is undecidable. Our proof uses the facts that F has finite commutator width and rank 2 abelianisation, then uses similar arguments used by B\"uchi and Senger and Ciobanu and Garreta to show the Diophantine problem in free groups and monoids with abelianisation constraints is undecidable.</description>

      <title>A random Hall-Paige conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complete mapping of a group $G$ is a bijection $\phi\colon G\to G$ such that $x\mapsto x\phi(x)$ is also bijective. Hall and Paige conjectured in 1955 that a finite group $G$ has a complete mapping whenever $\prod_{x\in G} x$ is the identity in the abelianization of $G$. This was confirmed in 2009 by Wilcox, Evans, and Bray with a proof using the classification of finite simple groups. \par In this paper, we give a combinatorial proof of a far-reaching generalisation of the Hall-Paige conjecture for large groups. We show that for random-like and equal-sized subsets $A,B,C$ of a group $G$, there exists a bijection $\phi\colon A\to B$ such that $x\mapsto x\phi(x)$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$ whenever $\prod_{a\in A} a \prod_{b\in B} b=\prod_{c\in C} c$ in the abelianization of $G$. We use this statement as a black-box to settle the following old problems in combinatorial group theory for large groups. (1) We characterise sequenceable groups, that is, groups which admit a permutation $\pi$ of their elements such that the partial products $\pi_1$, $\pi_1\pi_2$, $\pi_1\pi_2\cdots \pi_n$ are all distinct. This resolves a problem of Gordon from 1961 and confirms conjectures made by several authors, including Keedwell's 1981 conjecture that all large non-abelian groups are sequenceable. We also characterise the related $R$-sequenceable groups, addressing a problem of Ringel from 1974. (2) We confirm in a strong form a conjecture of Snevily from 1999 by characterising large subsquares of multiplication tables of finite groups that admit transversals. Previously, this characterisation was known only for abelian groups of odd order (by a combination of papers by Alon and Dasgupta-K\'arolyi-Serra-Szegedy and Arsovski).</description>

      <title>On Morita equivalences with endopermutation source and isotypies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of equivalence between blocks of finite group algebras called an almost isotypy. An almost isotypy restricts to a weak isotypy in Brou\'{e}'s original definition, and it is slightly weaker than Linckelmann's version. We show that a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups - which has an endopermutation module as a source and which induces a Morita equivalence - gives rise, via slash functors, to an almost isotypy if the character values of a (hence any) source are rational integers. Consequently, if two blocks are Morita equivalent via a bimodule with endopermutation source, then they are almost isotypic. We also explain why the notion of almost isotypies is reasonable.</description>
