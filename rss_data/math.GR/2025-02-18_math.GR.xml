      <title>Sharply k-transitive actions on ultrahomogeneous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an action of a group $G$ by automorphisms on an infinite relational structure $\mathcal{M}$, we say that the action is structurally sharply $k$-transitive if, for any two $k$-tuples $\bar{a}, \bar{b} \in M^k$ of distinct elements such that $\bar{a} \mapsto \bar{b}$ is an isomorphism, there exists exactly one element of $G$ sending $\bar{a}$ to $\bar{b}$. This generalises the well-known notion of a sharply $k$-transitive action on a set. We show that, for $k \leq 3$, a wide range of countable ultrahomogeneous structures admit structurally sharply $k$-transitive actions by finitely generated virtually free groups, giving a substantial answer to a question of Cameron from the book Oligomorphic Permutation Groups. We also show that the random $k$-hypertournament admits a structurally sharply $k$-transitive action for $k=4,5$, and that $\mathbb{Q}$ and several of its reducts admit structurally sharply $k$-transitive actions for all $k$. (This contrasts with the case of sets, where for $k \geq 4$ there are no sharply $k$-transitive actions on infinite sets by results of Tits and Hall.) We also show the existence of sharply $2$-transitive actions of finitely generated virtually free groups on an infinite set, solving the open question of whether such actions exist for hyperbolic groups.

      <title>Exactness and the topology of the space of invariant random equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize exactness of a countable group $\Gamma$ in terms of invariant random equivalence relations (IREs) on $\Gamma$. Specifically, we show that $\Gamma$ is exact if and only if every weak limit of finite IREs is an amenable IRE. In particular, for exact groups this implies amenability of the restricted rerooting relation associated to the ideal Bernoulli Voronoi tessellation, the discrete analog of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tesselation.</description>

      <title>Application of maximal subgroups of exceptional groups in s-arc-transitivity of vertex-primitive digraphs (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of maximal subgroups of simple groups of Lie type is intimately related to the study of primitive actions. With the recent publication of Craven's paper giving the complete list of the maximal subgroups of \(F_{4}(q)\), \(E_{6}(q)\) and \({}^{2}E_{6}(q)\), we are able to thoroughly analyse the primitive action of an exceptional group on an \(s\)-arc-transitive digraph and partially answer the following question posed by Giudici and Xia: Is there an upper bound on $s$ for finite vertex-primitive $s$-arc-transitive digraphs that are not directed cycles? Giudici and Xia reduced this question to the case where the automorphism group of the digraph is an almost simple group. Subsequently, it was proved that $s\leq 2$ when the simple group is a projective special linear group, projective symplectic group or an alternating group, and $s\leq 1$ when the simple group is a Suzuki group, a small Ree group, or one of the 22 sporadic groups. In this work, we proved that $s\leq 2$ when the simple group is $ {}^3D_4(q)$, $G_2(q)$, ${}^2F_4(q)$, $F_4(q)$, $E_6(q)$ or ${}^2E_6(q)$.</description>

      <title>On the $1$-cohomology of $\mathrm{SL}(n,{\mathbb K})$ on the dual of its adjoint module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a field $\mathbb K$, for any $n\geq 3$ the first cohomology group $H^1(G_n,A^*_n)$ of the special linear group $G_n = \mathrm{SL}(n,{\mathbb K})$ over the dual $A^*_n$ of its adjoint module $A_n$ is isomorphic to the space $\mathrm{Der}({\mathbb K})$ of the derivations of $\mathbb K$, except possibly when $|{\mathbb K}| \in \{2, 4\}$ and $n$ is even. This fact is stated by S. Smith and H. V\"{o}lklein in their paper "A geometric presentation for the adjont module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(k)$" (J. Algebra 127 (1989), 127--138). They claim that when $|{\mathbb K}| &gt; 9$ this fact follows from the main result of V\"{o}lklein's paper "The 1-cohomology of the adjoint module of a Chevalley group" (Forum Math. 1 (1989), 1--13), but say nothing that can help the reader to deduce it from that result. When $|{\mathbb K}| \leq 9$ they obtain the isomorphism $H^1(G_n,A^*_n) \cong \mathrm{Der}({\mathbb K})$ by means of other results from homological algebra, which however miss the case $|{\mathbb K}| \in\{2, 4\}$ with $n $ even. In the present paper we shall provide a straightforward proof of the isomorphism $H^1(G_n,A^*_n) \cong \mathrm{Der}({\mathbb K})$ under the hypothesis $n &gt; 3$. Our proof also covers the above mentioned missing case.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic of matrices over rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The book is devoted to investigation of arithmetic of the matrix rings over certain classes of commutative finitely generated principal ideals do- mains. We mainly concentrate on constructing of the matrix factorization theory. We reveal a close relationship between the matrix factorization and specific properties of subgroups of the complete linear group and the special normal form of matrices with respect to unilateral equivalence. The properties of matrices over rings of stable range 1.5 are thoroughly studied.
  The book is intended for experts in the ring theory and linear algebra, senior and post-graduate students.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Cycles in Signed and Multisigned Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A signed complete graph contains both positive and negative Hamiltonian cycles if and only if it also contains both positive and negative triangles. Otherwise, all Hamiltonian cycles are negative if and only if all triangles are negative and n is odd, while all Hamiltonian cycles are positive if and only if all triangles are negative and n is even, or all triangles are positive. Extending these results to multisigned complete graphs, we prove that such a graph contains at least two Hamiltonian cycles with different multisigns if and only if it contains at least two triangles with different multisigns.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Green and Liebeck concerning codes in symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of the symmetric group $S_n$ and $r$ a positive integer. If for every $g\in S_n$, there are precisely $r$ pairs $(a,b)\in A\times B$ such that $g=ab$, then we say that $A$ divides $r S_n$; the subset $B$ is called a code with respect to $A$ and we write $r S_n=A\boldsymbol{\cdot}B$. In this paper, we resolve a conjecture by Green and Liebeck \cite[Conjecture 2.3]{Green20} about codes in $S_n$. Let $n&gt;2k$ and let $j$ be such that $2^j\leqslant k&lt;2^{j+1}$. Suppose that $X = x^{S_n}$ is a conjugacy class in $S_n$ and $Y_k$ is the subgroup $S_k\times S_{n-k}$ of $S_n$, where the factor $S_k$ permutes the subset $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and the factor $S_{n-k}$ permutes the subset $\{k+1,\ldots,n\}$. We show that $r S_n=X\boldsymbol{\cdot}Y_k$ if and only if the cycle-type of $x$ has exactly one cycle of length $2^i$ for $0\leqslant i\leqslant j$ and all other cycles have length at least $k+1$.</description>

      <title>Cycle-lengths of Multi-Dimensional $\sigma$ Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the game Lights Out is played according to an algorithm specifying the player's exact sequence of moves, it can be modeled using deterministic cellular automata. One such model reduces to the $\sigma$ automaton, which evolves according to the 2-dimensional analog of Rule 90. We consider how the cycle lengths of multi-dimensional $\sigma$ automata depend on their dimension. The main result of this work is that the cycle-lengths of 1-dimensional $\sigma$ automata and 2-dimensional $\sigma$ automata (of the same size) are equal, and we prove this by relating the eigenvalues and Jordan blocks of their respective transition matrices. We also find that cycle-lengths of higher-dimensional $\sigma$ automata are bounded (despite the number of lattice sites increasing with dimension) and eventually saturate the upper bound. On the way, we derive a general formula for the size of the largest Jordan block of the Kronecker sum of two matrices over $GF(2)$ using properties of Pascal's Triangle.</description>

      <title>The plus construction with respect to subrings of the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of universal $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclic spaces $\mathcal M$, for any subset $J$ of the prime numbers. The corresponding nullification functors provide thus plus construction functors for ordinary homology with $\mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$ coefficients. Motivated by classical results about Quillen's plus construction for integral homology, we prove that the $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclization functor and the $\mathcal M$-cellularization functor coincide. We show that the acyclization-plus construction fiber sequence is always a cofiber sequence for simply connected spaces, but almost never so when the plus construction is not simply connected, unlike in the classical case.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to begin studying the computation of the nonzero determinant of semigroups within the class of finite semigroups that possesses a pair of non-commutative idempotents. This paper focuses on a class of these semigroups introduced as $\ll$-smooth semigroups. This computation is applicable in the context of the extension of the MacWilliams theorem for codes over semigroup algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle in the setting of cancellative, amenable semigroups. Besides being of intrinsic interest on its own, this result allows us to answer a variety of questions concerning sets of recurrence and van der Corput (vdC) sets, which were posed by Bergelson and Lesigne \cite{BL}, Bergelson and Ferr\'e Moragues \cite{BF}, and Moreira \cite{Mor}. We also prove a spectral characterization of vdC sets and prove some of their basic properties in the context of countable amenable groups.
  Several results in this article were independently discovered by Sohail Farhangi and Robin Tucker-Drob in \cite{FT}.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low elements and Join Irreducible gates in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study the "tight gates" of some "regular" partitions in Coxeter groups. In particular, we study the tight gates of the cone type partition of a Coxeter group $W$; a partition giving rise to the minimal automaton recognising the language of reduced words of $W$ recently studied by Parkinson and Yau (2022) and Przytycki and Yau (2024). We show that "tight gates" are the join-irreducible elements of the $m$-low Garside shadows for $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and the smallest Garside shadow of $W$ under the right weak order. In the case of the tight gates of the cone type partition, we show that they also act as a "gate" of the witnesses of boundary roots of cone types. As an application of these results, we give a very efficient method of determining whether two elements have the same cone type without computing the minimal automaton. We also apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in some select classes of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and Yau for these groups. Furthermore, we explicitly describe the tight gates of the cone type partition in these cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ be probability measures on $\mathrm{Diff}^1_+(S^1)$ satisfying a suitable moment condition and such that their supports genererate discrete groups acting proximally on $S^1$. Let $(f^n_\omega)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}, (f^n_{\omega'})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be two independent realizations of the random walk driven by $\mu_1, \mu_2$ respectively. We show that almost surely there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq N$ the elements $f^n_\omega, f^n_{\omega'}$ generate a nonabelian free group. The proof is inspired by the strategy by R. Aoun for linear groups and uses work of A. Gorodetski, V. Kleptsyn and G. Monakov, and of P. Barrientos and D. Malicet. A weaker (and easier) statement holds for measures supported on $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ with no moment conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the results of ($\textit{Groups, Geom. Dyn.}$, forthcoming) to describe the split left-invariant Riemannian distances on higher-rank Sol-type groups $G=\mathbf{N}\rtimes \mathbb{R}^k$. We show that the rough isometry type of such a distance is determined by a specific restriction of the metric to $\mathbb{R}^k$, and therefore the space of rough similarity types of distances is parameterized by the symmetric space $SL_k(\mathbb{R})/SO_k(\mathbb{R})$. In order to prove this result, we describe a family of uniformly roughly geodesic paths, which arise by way of the new technique of $\textit{Euclidean curve surgery}$.</description>

      <title>Commensurating actions for groups of piecewise continuous transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use partial actions, as formalized by Exel, to construct various commensurating actions. We use this in the context of groups piecewise preserving a geometric structure, and we interpret the transfixing property of these commensurating actions as the existence of a model for which the group acts preserving the geometric structure. We apply this to many groups with piecewise properties in dimension 1, notably piecewise of class C^k, piecewise affine, piecewise projective (possibly discontinuous).
  We derive various conjugacy results for subgroups with Property FW, or distorted cyclic subgroups, or more generally in the presence of rigidity properties for commensurating actions. For instance we obtain, under suitable assumptions, the conjugacy of a given piecewise affine action to an affine action on possibly another model. By the same method, we obtain a similar result in the projective case. An illustrating corollary is the fact that the group of piecewise projective self-transformations of the circle has no infinite subgroup with Kazhdan's Property T; this corollary is new even in the piecewise affine case.
  In addition, we use this to provide of the classification of circle subgroups of piecewise projective homeomorphisms of the projective line. The piecewise affine case is a classical result of Minakawa.</description>

      <title>On the isomorphism problem for monoids of product-one sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be torsion groups. We prove that the monoids of product-one sequences over $G_1$ and over $G_2$ are isomorphic if and only if the groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic. This was known before for abelian groups.</description>

      <title>The algebra of the monoid of order-preserving functions on an $n$-set and other reduced $E$-Fountain semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With every reduced $E$-Fountain semigroup $S$ which satisfies the generalized right ample condition we associate a category with zero morphisms $\mathcal{C}(S)$. Under some assumptions we prove an isomorphism of $\Bbbk$-algebras $\Bbbk S\simeq\Bbbk_{0}\mathcal{C}(S)$ between the semigroup algebra and the contracted category algebra where $\Bbbk$ is any commutative unital ring. This is a simultaneous generalization of a former result of the author on reduced E-Fountain semigroups which satisfy the congruence condition, a result of Junying Guo and Xiaojiang Guo on strict right ample semigroups and a result of Benjamin Steinberg on idempotent semigroups with central idempotents. The applicability of the new isomorphism is demonstrated with two well-known monoids which are not members of the above classes. The monoid of order-preserving functions on an $n$-set and the monoid of binary relations with demonic composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey we review different instances in which the Drinfeld double of a finite group and its representations play a role, touching upon some of Tom Koornwinder's research interests: harmonic analysis, Lie algebras, quantum groups, non-commutative geometry, and Verlinde formula.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>Growing Spines Ad Infinitum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every non-trivial ordered abelian group $G$ is augmentable by infinite elements, i.e., we have $G\preccurlyeq H\oplus G$ for some non-trivial ordered abelian group $H$. As an application, we show that when $k$ is a field of characteristic 0, then $k$ is not $t$-henselian if and only if all henselian valuations with residue field $k$ are ($\emptyset$-)definable.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups and applications to evolution families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [31, 11, 13]). In the \emph{non-commutative} setting, Sz.-Nagy [41] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate arbitrary families of contractions. The present work extends this discrete-time result to families $\{T_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) An explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) A full proof with an explicit construction, via the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S\l{}oci\'{n}ski [37, 38] as well as a version for topologised index sets via a reformulation of the Trotter--Kato theorem for co-generators, leading to applications to evolution families; and 3) A second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups, which admits a natural reformulation to semigroup defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and leads to various residuality results.</description>
