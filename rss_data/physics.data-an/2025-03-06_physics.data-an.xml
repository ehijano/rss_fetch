      <title>Monitoring of the offset between UTC and its prediction broadcast by the GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to report in the Section 4 of BIPM Circular T daily values of the offset between UTC and the predictions of UTC broadcast by the GNSS, this quantity we name bUTC_GNSS. In this approach, the determination of UTC - bUTC_GNSS is based on data collected by several multi-GNSS stations in selected time laboratories worldwide. Test computations over a 7-month period from July 2022 to January 2023 show that the offset between UTC and bUTC_GNSS was between 30 and 50 ns for GLONASS, between 5 and 20 ns for BeiDou, and between -5 and +5 ns for GPS and Galileo. We derive the uncertainty on the reported values, which is 4.1 ns for BeiDou and GPS, 3.7 ns for Galileo and 6.6 ns for GLONASS and show that, over the test period, the reported values of UTC - bUTC_GNSS and the solutions obtained from each multi-GNSS station are all consistent within the 1-sigma uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Generating Networks to Target Assortativity via Archimedean Copula Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach to generate random graphs to a target level of assortativity by using copula structures in graphons. Unlike existing random graph generators, we do not use rewiring or binning approaches to generate the desired random graph. Instead, we connect Archimedean bivariate copulas to graphons in order to produce flexible models that can generate random graphs to target assortativity. We propose three models that use the copula distribution function, copula density function and their mixed tensor product to produce networks. We express the assortativity coefficient in terms of homomorphism densities. Establishing this relationship forges a connection between the parameter of the copula and the frequency of subgraphs in the generated network. Therefore, our method attains a desired the subgraph distribution as well as the target assortativity. We establish the homomorphism densities and assortativity coefficient for each of the models. Numerical examples demonstrate the ability of the proposed models to produce graphs with different levels of assortativity.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established phase retrieval algorithms. In this work, we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored to X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) single-shot single-particle diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Precision of Signal Correction in PVES Experiments: The Impact of Bayesian Analysis on the Results of the QWeak and MOLLER Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of parity-violating asymmetries in parity-violating electron scattering experiments is a powerful tool for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. Achieving the expected precision requires both experimental and post-processing signal corrections. This includes using auxiliary detectors to distinguish the main signal from background signals and implementing post-measurement corrections, such as the Bayesian statistics method, to address uncontrolled factors during the experiments. Asymmetry values in the scattering of electrons off proton targets in QWeak and P2 and off electron targets in MOLLER are influenced by detector array configurations, beam polarization angles, and beam spin variations. The Bayesian framework refines full probabilistic models to account for all necessary factors, thereby extracting asymmetry values and the underlying physics under specified conditions. For the QWeak experiment, a reanalysis of the inelastic asymmetry measurement using the Bayesian method has yielded a closer fit to measured asymmetries, with uncertainties reduced by 40\% compared to the Monte Carlo minimization method. This approach was successfully applied to simulated data for the MOLLER experiment and is predicted to be similarly effective in P2.</description>
