      <title>Spiking Neural Network Architecture Search: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey paper presents a comprehensive examination of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture search (SNNaS) from a unique hardware/software co-design perspective. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, have emerged as a promising approach to neuromorphic computing. They offer significant advantages in terms of power efficiency and real-time resource-constrained processing, making them ideal for edge computing and IoT applications. However, designing optimal SNN architectures poses significant challenges, due to their inherent complexity (e.g., with respect to training) and the interplay between hardware constraints and SNN models. We begin by providing an overview of SNNs, emphasizing their operational principles and key distinctions from traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then provide a brief overview of the state of the art in NAS for ANNs, highlighting the challenges of directly applying these approaches to SNNs. We then survey the state-of-the-art in SNN-specific NAS approaches. Finally, we conclude with insights into future research directions for SNN research, emphasizing the potential of hardware/software co-design in unlocking the full capabilities of SNNs. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, offering a holistic view of SNNaS and underscoring the importance of a co-design approach to harness the true potential of neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Information flow in multilayer perceptrons: an in-depth analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing how information flows along the layers of a multilayer perceptron is a topic of paramount importance in the field of artificial neural networks. After framing the problem from the point of view of information theory, in this position article a specific investigation is conducted on the way information is processed, with particular reference to the requirements imposed by supervised learning. To this end, the concept of information matrix is devised and then used as formal framework for understanding the aetiology of optimisation strategies and for studying the information flow. The underlying research for this article has also produced several key outcomes: i) the definition of a parametric optimisation strategy, ii) the finding that the optimisation strategy proposed in the information bottleneck framework shares strong similarities with the one derived from the information matrix, and iii) the insight that a multilayer perceptron serves as a kind of "adaptor", meant to process the input according to the given objective.</description>

      <title>Laser Fault Injection in Memristor-Based Accelerators for AI/ML and Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays (MCA) are emerging as efficient building blocks for in-memory computing and neuromorphic hardware due to their high density and parallel analog matrix-vector multiplication capabilities. However, the physical properties of their nonvolatile memory elements introduce new attack surfaces, particularly under fault injection scenarios. This work explores Laser Fault Injection as a means of inducing analog perturbations in MCA-based architectures. We present a detailed threat model in which adversaries target memristive cells to subtly alter their physical properties or outputs using laser beams. Through HSPICE simulations of a large MCA on 45 nm CMOS tech. node, we show how laser-induced photocurrent manifests in output current distributions, enabling differential fault analysis to infer internal weights with up to 99.7% accuracy, replicate the model, and compromise computational integrity through targeted weight alterations by approximately 143%.</description>

      <title>CodeEvolve: An open source evolutionary coding agent for algorithm discovery and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems. To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete framework as an open-source repository.</description>

      <title>SHaRe-SSM: An Oscillatory Spiking Neural Network for Target Variable Modeling in Long Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning. Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences, thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling (including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences. Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$ less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.</description>

      <title>Online Reliable Anomaly Detection via Neuromorphic Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor communications and achieving low detection latency.</description>

      <title>Provable Unlearning with Gradient Ascent on Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models, addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch. Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful} unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic Gaussian-mixture setting.</description>

      <title>Online Continual Learning via Spiking Neural Networks with Sleep Enhanced Latent Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment. However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP and Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.</description>
