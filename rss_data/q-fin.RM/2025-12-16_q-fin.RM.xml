      <title>Institutionalizing risk curation in decentralized credit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper maps the emerging market for decentralized credit in which ERC 4626 vaults and third-party curators, rather than monolithic lending protocols alone, increasingly determine underwriting and leverage decisions. We show that modular vaults differ in capital utilization, cross-chain and cross asset concentration, and liquidity risk structure. Further, we show that a small set of curators intermediates a disproportionate share of system TVL, exhibits clustered tail co movement, and captures markedly different fee margins despite broadly similar collateral composition. These findings indicate that the main locus of risk in DeFi lending has migrated upward from base protocols, where underwriting is effectively centralized in a single DAO governed parameter set, to a permissionless curator layer in which competing vault managers decide which assets and loans are originated. We argue that this shift requires a corresponding upgrade in transparency standards and outline a simple set of onchain disclosures that would allow users and DAOs to evaluate curator strategies on a comparable, money market style basis.</description>

      <title>Extending the application of dynamic Bayesian networks in calculating market risk: Standard and stressed expected shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last five years, expected shortfall (ES) and stressed ES (SES) have become key required regulatory measures of market risk in the banking sector, especially following events such as the global financial crisis. Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&amp;P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best. All distribution-dependent models deteriorate substantially when using the skewed Student's t distribution. The DBNs perform comparably to the historical simulation model, but their contribution to tail prediction is limited by the small weight assigned to their one-day-ahead forecasts within the return distribution. Future research should examine weighting schemes that enhance the influence of forward-looking DBN forecasts on tail risk estimation.</description>

      <title>Disability insurance with collective health claims: A mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic semi-Markov disability model is expanded with individual and collective health claims to improve its explanatory and predictive power -- in particular in the context of group experience rating. The inclusion of collective health claims leads to a computationally challenging many-body problem. By adopting a mean-field approach, this many-body problem can be approximated by a non-linear one-body problem, which in turn leads to a transparent pricing method for disability coverages based on a lower-dimensional system of non-linear forward integro-differential equations. In a practice-oriented simulation study, the mean-field approximation clearly stands its ground in comparison to na\"ive Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Hedging with Reinforcement Learning: A Practical Framework for Option Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement-learning (RL) framework for dynamic hedging of equity index option exposures under realistic transaction costs and position limits. We hedge a normalized option-implied equity exposure (one unit of underlying delta, offset via SPY) by trading the underlying index ETF, using the option surface and macro variables only as state information and not as a direct pricing engine. Building on the "deep hedging" paradigm of Buehler et al. (2019), we design a leak-free environment, a cost-aware reward function, and a lightweight stochastic actor-critic agent trained on daily end-of-day panel data constructed from SPX/SPY implied volatility term structure, skew, realized volatility, and macro rate context. On a fixed train/validation/test split, the learned policy improves risk-adjusted performance versus no-hedge, momentum, and volatility-targeting baselines (higher point-estimate Sharpe); only the GAE policy's test-sample Sharpe is statistically distinguishable from zero, although confidence intervals overlap with a long-SPY benchmark so we stop short of claiming formal dominance. Turnover remains controlled and the policy is robust to doubled transaction costs. The modular codebase, comprising a data pipeline, simulator, and training scripts, is engineered for extensibility to multi-asset overlays, alternative objectives (e.g., drawdown or CVaR), and intraday data. From a portfolio management perspective, the learned overlay is designed to sit on top of an existing SPX or SPY allocation, improving the portfolio's mean-variance trade-off with controlled turnover and drawdowns. We discuss practical implications for portfolio overlays and outline avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>Extremal cases of distortion risk measures with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of distributional uncertainty on key risk measures under the partial knowledge of underlying distributions characterized by their first two moments and shape information (specifically symmetry and/or unimodality). We first employ probability inequalities to establish the theoretical best- and worst-case bounds on Value-at-Risk, reflecting the most extreme tail risk achievable within the moment and shape constraints, and then we extend this worst-case/best-case analysis to a broad class of distortion risk measures by the modified Schwarz inequality, deriving their corresponding robust bounds under the same partial information setting concerning moments and distribution shapes of the underlying distributions. In addition, we give a clear characterization of the distributions that attain the best- and worst-case scenarios. The proposed approach provides a unified framework for extremal problems of distortion risk measures.</description>

      <title>Approaches for modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9: A tutorial using discrete-time survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9, credit losses ought to be recognised timeously and accurately. This requirement belies a certain degree of dynamicity when estimating the constituent parts of a credit loss event, most notably the probability of default (PD). It is notoriously difficult to produce such PD-estimates at every point of loan life that are adequately dynamic and accurate, especially when considering the ever-changing macroeconomic background. In rendering these lifetime PD-estimates, the choice of modelling technique plays an important role, which is why we first review a few classes of techniques, including the merits and limitations of each. Our main contribution however is the development of an in-depth and data-driven tutorial using a particular class of techniques called discrete-time survival analysis. This tutorial is accompanied by a diverse set of reusable diagnostic measures for evaluating various aspects of a survival model and the underlying data. A comprehensive R-based codebase is further contributed. We believe that our work can help cultivate common modelling practices under IFRS 9, and should be valuable to practitioners, model validators, and regulators alike.</description>

      <title>Strict universality of the square-root law in price impact across stocks: a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models (Nature 2003, QJE 2006, and Quant. Finance 2013). Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>
