      <title>Silicon Photonics Foundry Fabricated, Slow-Light Enhanced, Low Power Thermal Phase Shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we developed a low-power silicon photonics foundry-fabricated slow-light thermal phase shifter (SLTPS) where the slow-light (SL) effect is achieved using an integrated Bragg grating (BG) waveguide. Heating the grating induces a red shift in the transmission spectrum, leading to an increased group index $n_g$ during operation, which facilitates a further reduction in the voltage needed for a $\pi$ phase shift, i.e. $V_{\pi}$. Additionally, we investigated a compact Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) that incorporates the SLTPS in both arms with a phase shifter length of 50 $\mu$m. A detailed theoretical analysis was conducted to address the non-idealities of the SL-MZI due to uneven optical power splitting and unbalanced loss in the two MZI arms. The $V_{\pi}$ and power consumption for a $\pi$ phase shift $(P_{\pi})$ of the SL-MZI were quantified for operation in the slow light regime, demonstrating a $V_{\pi}$ of 1.1 V and a $P_{\pi}$ of 3.63 mW at an operational wavelength near the photonic band edge. The figure of merit (FOM) $P_{\pi} \times \tau$ is commonly used to assess the performance of thermal optical switches. The SL-MZI in this work has achieved a low $P_{\pi} \times \tau$ of 5.1 mW $\mu$s. Insertion loss of the SL-MZI ranges from 1.3 dB to 4.4 dB depending on the operation wavelength, indicating a trade-off with the $V_\pi$ reduction.</description>

      <title>Dual-Core Optical Fibers for Efficient Mid-Infrared Generation via Third Order Frequency Mixing and Coupling-Length Phase Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Appropriately designed dual-core fibers using coupling-length phase matching (CLPM) allow for phase-matched frequency downconversion over wide frequency intervals using the third-order optical nonlinearity of glass. By tuning the distance between the two cores, CLPM allows continuously tunable phase matching for widely different wavelengths for the process in which a pump wave at a frequency $\omega_2$ generates or amplifies two waves with frequencies $\omega_3&gt;\omega_2$ and $\omega_1 = 2 \omega_2 - \omega_3$. The intensity-dependent correction that accounts for nonlinear phase-modulation is derived in general. In addition, a specific CLPM configuration is found to be insensitive to phase-modulation, and can achieve 100\% theoretical quantum yield for pump wave injection in one core. Fiber-based frequency converters can thus be designed for large differences between pump wavelengths and generated wavelengths, with the phase-matched interaction enabling the use of meter-long fibers to compensate for low third-order susceptibilities. Examples of fiber designs for pump wavelengths at 1.3 and 1.55 $\mu$m, to generate radiation with wavelengths longer than 2 $\mu$m, are discussed for silica and fluoride fibers.</description>

      <title>CMOS-Compatible, AlScN-Based Integrated Electro-Optic Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial production of integrated photonic devices is limited by scalability of desirable material platforms. We explore a relatively new photonic material, AlScN, for its use in electro-optic modulation. Its CMOS-compatibility could facilitate large-scale production of integrated photonic modulators, and it exhibits an enhanced second-order optical nonlinearity compared to intrinsic AlN, indicating the possibility for efficient modulation. Here, we measure the electro-optic effect in AlScN-based modulators, demonstrating $V_{\pi}L$ around 750 V$\cdot$cm. Since the electro-optic response is smaller than expected, we discuss potential causes for the reduced response and future outlook for AlScN-based photonics.</description>

      <title>Dual-color Coherent Perfect Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect absorption of light critically affects light-matter interaction for various applications. Coherent perfect absorbers (CPA) gain the unique capability of controlling light with light in a linear fashion. Multi-color CPAs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 033901] are highly desirable for broadband and nonlinear light-to-light coherent control, however, the experimental demonstration has still remained elusive. Here we experimentally observe a dual-color version of CPA (DC-CPA) through a second harmonic generation in a single whispering-gallery-mode microcavity. The DC-CPA enables simultaneous perfect absorption of both the incoming fundamental wave and its second harmonic. Similar to its linear counterpart, coherent control in the DC-CPA can be also realized by tuning the relative phase and intensity between the two-colored waves through nonlinear interference instead of the linear one. This scheme breaks the linear boundary of the traditional CPA into a multi-frequency domain and paves the way toward all-optically signal processing and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Second-harmonic optical diffraction tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) has emerged as an important label-free tool in biomedicine to measure the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a biological sample. In this paper, we describe ODT using second-harmonic generation (SHG) which is a coherent nonlinear optical process with a strict symmetry selectivity and has several advantages over traditional fluorescence methods. We report the tomographic retrieval of the 3D second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility using two-dimensional holographic measurements of the SHG fields at different illumination angles and polarization states. The method is a generalization of the conventional linear ODT to the nonlinear scenario. We demonstrate the method with a numerically simulated nanoparticle distribution and an experiment with muscle tissue fibers. Our results show that SHG ODT does not only provide an effective contrast mechanism for label-free imaging but also due to the symmetry requirement enables the visualization of properties that are not otherwise accessible.</description>

      <title>Exciton polariton critical non-Hermitian skin effect with spin-momentum-locked gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical skin effect, an intriguing phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, displays sensitivity to system size and manifests distinct dynamical behaviors. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to achieve the critical non-Hermitian skin effect of exciton polaritons in an elongated microcavity system. We show that by utilising longitudinal-transverse spin splitting and spin-momentum-locked gain, a critical non-Hermitian skin effect can be achieved in a continuous system without the need of an underlying lattice. We find that a phase transition can be induced by changing the cavity detuning with respect to the exciton energy. We identify a measurable order parameter associated with this phase transition and demonstrate the corresponding critical behavior. Our work offers a flexible approach to manipulate non-Hermitian phases of exciton polaritons, thereby expanding the potential applications of polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>High Discrimination Ratio, Broadband Circularly Polarized Light Photodetector Using Dielectric Achiral Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-chip measurement of polarization states plays an increasingly crucial role in modern sensing and imaging applications. While high-performance monolithic linearly polarized photodetectors have been extensively studied, integrated circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors are still hindered by inadequate discrimination capability. In this study, we employ achiral all-dielectric nanostructures to develop a broadband CPL photodetector with an impressive discrimination ratio of ~107 at the wavelength of 405 nm, significantly surpassing its counterparts by two orders of magnitude. Our device shows outstanding CPL discrimination capability across the visible band without requiring intensity calibration. Its function mechanism is based on the CPL-dependent near-field modes within achiral structures: under left or right CPL illumination, distinct near-field modes are excited, resulting in asymmetric irradiation of the two electrodes and generating a photovoltage with directions determined by the chirality of the incident light field. The proposed design strategy facilitates the realization of ultra-compact CPL detection across diverse materials, structures, and spectral ranges, presenting a novel avenue for achieving high-performance monolithic CPL detection.</description>

      <title>Towards realistic magneto-optical matter: Modeling dynamics of magneto-optical dimers with arbitrary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical matter, a rapidly growing field, aims to develop novel methods for controlling and assembling mesoscale systems through fascinating light-matter interactions. Its traditional approaches often involve complex illumination fields with costly and unstable setups. These methods require strong gradient forces, high-intensity laser spots that could harm samples, and substrate support. This work introduces an alternative approach using magneto-optical particles and straightforward illumination to effectively create magneto-optical matter. Our numerical framework, grounded in Langevin dynamics and realistic collision phenomena, serves as a robust and universal tool for exploring various optomechanical designs. To illustrate the capabilities of the developed method, we examine the impact of thermal noise, collision types, geometric variations, and resonance excitation on a dimer system, generating multiple scenarios for favorable dimer formation and subsequent manipulation. It is found that anisotropic dimers tuned initially at magneto-optical resonance can bind in stable average positions even when particle-particle collisions are present. We believe our method and subsequent findings provide essential knowledge for studying optical binding and the dynamics of any small-scale cluster of electromagnetically interacting components.</description>

      <title>A 2.7 $\mu$m Backward Wave Optical Parametric Oscillator Source for CO$_2$ Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrated the direct use of an inherently narrowband backward wave in the mid-infrared for CO$_2$ and H$_2$O vapor spectroscopy in ambient air. This wave is generated in a backward wave optical parametric oscillator (BWOPO) pumped by a multi longitudinal mode laser at 1030 nm, eliminating the need for additional spectral narrowing or wavelength stabilization. A full characterization of the source is presented, revealing a central output at 2712 nm, showcasing temperature tuning of -1.77 GHz/K, and achieving an output pulse energy of 2.3 $\mu$J. Novel methods are introduced for measuring the linewidth and wavelength stability using lab air. These approaches demonstrate a narrow output of 43 pm and establish an upper limit of stability at 65 MHz, with no active means of stabilization. These findings underscore the potential of BWOPOs as a robust platform for future DIAL systems.</description>

      <title>Can we improve the energy efficiency of EUV lithography?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses a simple, low-cost, highly efficient two-mirror projector with a simplified illumination system. The EUV source power can be reduced by 1/10 compared to the current six-mirror EUV projector system. The required EUV power is 20 watts for process speed of 100 wafers per hour. The proposed in-line projector achieves 0.2 NA (20 mm field) and 0.3 NA (10 mm field), which can be assembled in a cylindrical tube configuration similar to a DUV projector, providing superior mechanical stability and easier assembly/maintenance. The EUV light is introduced in front of the mask through two narrow cylindrical mirrors located on both side of the diffraction cone, providing average normal illumination and reducing the mask 3D effect. The simplified illumination system provides symmetric quadrupole off-axis illumination, bypassing central obscuration and improving spatial resolution, also realizing K\"ohler illumination. The theoretical resolution limit is 24 nm (20 mm field), image reduction factor x5 and object image distance (OID) 2000 mm. With the curved surface mask, the tool height can be reduced to (OID) 1500 mm, which provides resolution 16 nm (10 mm field). It will be suitable for small die size chip production for mobile applications as well as the latest chiplet technology.</description>

      <title>Analytically controlling laser-induced electron phase in sub-cycle motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of the electron phase accumulated during its sub-cycle motion within intense laser fields is essential in strong-field physics, yet remains mostly indirect and complicated so far. In this Letter, we develop a novel approach to control this sub-cycle electron phase by tuning a low-frequency electric field applied on a centrosymmetric gaseous target during its interaction with a few-cycle infrared laser pulse. Our method is based on a universal analytical relation between the low-frequency electric field and its induced harmonic frequency shift, derived by the strong-field approximation. This simple relation and its universality are confirmed numerically by directly solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Moreover, we discuss the benefits of the discovered relation in \textit{in situ} applications, including continuously and precisely tuning XUV waves and developing a new method of comprehensively sampling THz pulse.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel, interferometric, two-color, high-order harmonic generation setup, based on a turn-key Ytterbium-doped femtosecond laser source and its second harmonic. Each interferometer arm contains a spatial light modulator, with individual capabilities to manipulate the spatial beam profiles and to stabilize the relative delay between the fundamental and the second harmonic. Additionally, separate control of the relative power and focusing geometries of the two color beams is implemented to conveniently perform automatized scans of multiple parameters. A live diagnostics system gives continuous information during ongoing measurements.</description>

      <title>Lasing in an Assembled Array of Silver Nanocubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a surface lattice resonance (SLR)-based plasmonic nanolaser that leverages bulk production of colloidal nanoparticles and assembly on templates with single particle resolution. SLRs emerge from the hybridization of the plasmonic and photonic modes when nanoparticles are arranged into periodic arrays and it can provide feedback for stimulated emission. It has been shown that perfect arrays are not a strict prerequisite for producing lasing. Here, we propose using high-quality colloids instead. Silver colloidal nanocubes feature excellent plasmonic properties due to their single-crystal nature and low facet roughness. We use capillarity-assisted nanoparticle assembly to produce substrates featuring SLR and comprising single nanocubes. Combined with a laser dye pyrromethene-597, the nanocube array lases at 574 nm with &lt;1.2 nm linewidth, &lt;100 uJ/cm2 lasing threshold, and produces a beam with &lt;1 mrad divergence, despite less-than-perfect arrangement. Such plasmonic nanolasers can be produced on a large-scale and integrated in point-of-care diagnostics, photonic integrated circuits, and optical communications applications.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on Silicon Photonics Integrated Platform Fiber Edge Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) play a crucial role in almost every aspect of modern life, such as data storage, telecommunications, medical diagnostics, green energy, autonomous driving, agriculture, and high-performance computing. To fully harness their benefits, an efficient coupling mechanism is required to successfully launch light into waveguides from fibers. This study introduces low-loss coupling strategies and their implementation for a silicon nitride integrated platform. Here we present an overview of coupling technologies, optimized designs, and a tutorial on manufacturing techniques for inverted tapers, which enable effective coupling for both transverse-magnetic and transverse-electric modes. The optimized coupling losses for the UHNA-7 fiber and the inverted taper Si3N4 coupler reached -0.81 dB at 1550 nm per connection for single-mode waveguides with 220x1200 nm cross section. The measured coupling losses in the inverted taper coupler with a standard single-mode fiber were -3.28 dB at 1550 nm per connection for the same platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a process for fabricating a wafer-scale array of alkali metal vapor cells with low residual gas pressure. We show that by etching long, thin channels between the cells on the Si wafer surface, the residual gas pressure in the evacuated vapor cell can be reduced to below 0.5 kPa (4 Torr) with a yield above 50 %. The low residual gas pressure in these mass-producible alkali vapor cells can enable a new generation of low-cost chip-scale atomic devices such as vapor cell optical clocks, wavelength references, and Rydberg sensors.</description>

      <title>Electrically Poled Vapor-Deposited Organic Glasses for Integrated Electro-Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce electrically-poled small molecule assemblies that can serve as the active electro-optic material in nano-scale guided-wave circuits such as those of the silicon photonics platform. These monolithic organic materials can be vacuum-deposited to homogeneously fill nanometer-size integrated-optics structures, and electrically poled at higher temperatures to impart an orientational non-centrosymmetric order that remains stable at room temperature. An initial demonstration using the DDMEBT molecule and corona poling delivered a material with the required high optical quality, an effective glass transition temperature of the order of $\sim 80$ $^\circ$C, and an electro-optic coefficient of $20$~pm/V.</description>

      <title>Ptychographic non-line-of-sight imaging for depth-resolved visualization of hidden objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging enables the visualization of objects hidden from direct view, with applications in surveillance, remote sensing, and light detection and ranging. Here, we introduce a NLOS imaging technique termed ptychographic NLOS (pNLOS), which leverages coded ptychography for depth-resolved imaging of obscured objects. Our approach involves scanning a laser spot on a wall to illuminate the hidden objects in an obscured region. The reflected wavefields from these objects then travel back to the wall, get modulated by the wall's complex-valued profile, and the resulting diffraction patterns are captured by a camera. By modulating the object wavefields, the wall surface serves the role of the coded layer as in coded ptychography. As we scan the laser spot to different positions, the reflected object wavefields on the wall translate accordingly, with the shifts varying for objects at different depths. This translational diversity enables the acquisition of a set of modulated diffraction patterns referred to as a ptychogram. By processing the ptychogram, we recover both the objects at different depths and the modulation profile of the wall surface. Experimental results demonstrate high-resolution, high-fidelity imaging of hidden objects, showcasing the potential of pNLOS for depth-aware vision beyond the direct line of sight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the development and applications of microstructured optical fibres for quantum technologies is summarised. The optical nonlinearity of solid-core and gas-filled hollow-core fibres provides a valuable medium for the generation of quantum resource states, as well as for quantum frequency conversion between the operating wavelengths of existing quantum photonic material architectures. The low loss, low latency and low dispersion of hollow-core fibres make these fibres particularly attractive for both short- and long-distance links in quantum networks. Hollow-core fibres also promise to replace free-space optical components in a wide range of atomic experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recently developed methodology termed photon induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), the inelastic scattering of electrons off illuminated nanostructures provides direct experimental access to the structure of optical near-field modes and their population. Whereas the inelastic scattering probability can be quantitatively linked to the near field distribution, analytical results for simple light scattering geometries are scarce. Here we derive a fully analytical expression for the coupling strength between free electrons and optical near-fields in planar geometries representing dielectric thin films. Contributions to the overall coupling from the electric field above, below and within the sample are analyzed in detail. By carefully choosing the relative angles between electron beam, light and thin film and by accounting for a broad spectrum of photon energies, we demonstrate that one can imprint optical material properties like the reflectivity onto the electron energy distribution.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal synthesis of material distributions in obstacles for maximal extinction, scattering, or absorption. The material synthesis is based on an explicit construction utilizing the current distribution derived from physical bounds excited from the far-field. The bounds are expressed in radiation modes for materials restricted by their resistivity and characteristic modes for materials restricted by the contrast. The results are valid for arbitrary shapes, and analytical expressions are provided for spherical shapes.</description>

      <title>Laser Offset Stabilization with Chip-Scale Atomic Diffractive Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise and adjustable control over laser frequency is an essential requirement in numerous applications such as precision spectroscopy, quantum control, and sensing. In many such applications it is desired to stabilize a laser with a variable detuning from an atomic line. In this study, we employ an offset-stabilization scheme by utilizing phase contrast spectroscopy in microfabricated atomic diffractive elements vapor-cells. The spectroscopic response of such a device generates oscillating optical fringes, providing multiple optical frequency stabilization points across a bandwidth of tens of gigahertz, centered around the absorption resonances of Rb. Using this device, we demonstrate laser stabilization at various offset frequencies with instabilities reaching sub-megahertz levels. We further explore the fundamental limitations of our hybrid atomic-photonic device, drawing parallels to birefringent and dichroic spectroscopy apparatuses, which are commonly employed for offset stabilization. Our system showcases a broad offset lock bandwidth, a highly compact footprint, scalability to chip-scale production, and the ability to operate without reliance on magnetic fields. These attributes pave the way for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A Flat Dual-Polarized Millimeter-Wave Luneburg Lens Antenna Using Transformation Optics with Reduced Anisotropy and Impedance Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a compact wideband dual-polarized Luneburg lens antenna (LLA) with reduced anisotropy and improved impedance matching is proposed in Ka band with a wide 2D beamscanning capability. Based on transformation optics, the spherical Luneburg lens is compressed into a cylindrical one, while the merits of high gain, broad band, wide scanning, and free polarization are preserved. A trigonometric function is employed to the material property of the flattened Luneburg lens with reduced anisotropy, thus effectively alleviates the strong reflection, the high sidelobes and back radiation with a free cost on the antenna weight and volume. Furthermore, a light thin wideband 7-by-1 metasurface phased array is studied as the primary feed for the LLA. The proposed metantenna, shorted for metamaterial-based antenna, has a high potential for B5G, future wireless communication and radar sensing as an onboard system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communications harness quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to enhance information transfer between remote nodes. Coherent quantum communications, essential for phase-based quantum internet architecture, require optical coherence among nodes and typically involve single-photon interference. Challenges like preserving optical coherence and integrating advanced single-photon detectors have impeded their deployment in existing telecommunication networks. This study introduces innovative approaches to the architecture and techniques supporting coherent quantum communications, marking their first successful integration within a commercial telecom infrastructure between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany. Employing the Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution protocol, we achieved encryption key distribution at 110 bit/s over 254 km. This system features measurement-device-independent properties and non-cryogenically cooled detectors, and represents the first effective quantum repeater implementation on telecom infrastructure, the longest practical quantum key distribution deployment to date, and validates the feasibility of a phase-based quantum internet architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in electron microscopy have introduced innovative techniques enabling the inelastic interaction of fast electrons with tightly confined and intense light fields. These techniques, commonly summarized under the term photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy now offer unprecedented capabilities for a precise mapping of the characteristics of optical near-fields with remarkable spatial resolution but their spectral resolution were only scarcely investigated. In this study, we employ a strongly chirped and temporally broadband light pulse to investigate the interaction between free electrons and light at the edge of a MoS2 thin film. Our approach unveils the details of electron-light coupling, revealing a pronounced dependence of the coupling strength on both the position and photon energy. Employing numerical simulations of a simplified model system we identify these modulations to be caused by optical interferences between the incident and reflected field as well as an optical mode guided within the transition metal dichalcogenide film.</description>

Abstract: Double-aperture Young interferometry is widely used in accelerators to provide a one-dimensional beam measurement. We improve this technique by combining and further developing techniques of non-redundant aperture masking and self-calibration from astronomy. Using visible synchrotron radiation, tests at the ALBA synchrotron show that this method provides an accurate two-dimensional beam transverse characterisation, even from a single 1ms interferogram. The technique is resistant to phase fluctuations that might be introduced by vibration of optical components, or in the laboratory atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Auger photoemission as a laser-like coherent cathode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of quantum advancements across disciplines, a bright and coherent electron source is expected to be a cornerstone of diverse applications including electron microscopy, laser accelerators, and free electron lasers. Current cathodes, such as cold field and photoemission, can generate high-quality electron beams with different cathode materials, geometric configurations, and laser excitation profiles, but their maintenance of both quantum coherence and high beam brightness suffers from the space-charge repulsion of many electrons. Here, we propose a new mechanism to provide collective emission of coherent electrons based on Auger photoemission. Our approach leverages a photon-induced four-level Auger process that necessitates a combination of photoemission and Auger recombination. The Auger electrons, energized through a recycling process of photoelectrons, emit collectively into the vacuum as secondary electrons. We compare coherent and incoherent Auger photoemission, identifying that the working condition of the coherent photoemission requires population inversion, akin to the four-level laser system. Our work provides insights for experimental realization and nanofabrication of Auger photocathodes, addressing a critical need in advancing quantum technologies relating to correlated coherent sources.</description>

Abstract: Rayleigh's criterion posits that resolving point sources below point spread function width is impossible. Statistical estimation overcomes this but suffers from increasing error at shorter distances, known as Rayleigh's curse. Target mode shaping solves this for equal sources but not for multi-parameter objects like emitters with unknown brightness ratio. We propose BLESS technique, utilizing Beam moduLation and Examination of Shot Statistics, breaking Rayleigh's curse for unbalanced sources. Demonstrated through classical and quantum Cramer-Rao bound calculations, BLESS shows significant potential for real imaging experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopy detected in the time domain entails many techniques, such as FTIR, pump-probe, FT-Raman, and 2DES, and applications, such as molecule characterization, excited state dynamics studies, or spectra classifications. Surprisingly, all these techniques use sampling schemes that rarely exploit the a priori knowledge the scientist has before the experiment. Indeed, not all the sampling coordinates carry the same amount of information. In this work, we rationalize with examples the various advantages of a smart sampling scheme tailored to the specific experiment characteristics and/or the expected results. The application of a Fisher information approach allows for finding the best sampling scheme to minimize the variance of a desired observable, greatly improving, for example, spectral classifications and multidimensional spectroscopy. In general, we demonstrate how a smart sampling allows reducing by one to two orders of magnitude the acquisition time of an experiment while still providing a similar level of information.</description>

Abstract: We study the time-reflection and time-refraction of waves caused by a spatial interface with a medium undergoing a sudden temporal change in permittivity. We show that monochromatic waves are transformed into a pulse by the permittivity change, and that time-reflection is enhanced at the vicinity of the critical angle for total internal reflection. In this regime, we find that the evanescent field is transformed into a propagating pulse by the sudden change in permittivity. These effects display enhancement of the time-reflection and high sensitivity near the critical angle, paving the way to experiments on time-reflection and photonic time-crystals at optical frequencies</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key issue in the use of high-power mid-infrared (Mid-IR) laser sources for a plethora of applications is the investigation of the exciting laser driven physical phenomena taking place in materials coated with dielectric films. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast processes and thermal response upon excitation of two-layered complexes consisting of fused silica thin films placed on silicon substrates with ultrashort pulsed lasers in the Mid-IR spectral regime. Through the development of a theoretical model, we demonstrate that the control of the underlying ultrafast phenomena and the damage threshold (DT) of the substrate are achieved via an appropriate modulation of the thickness of the SiO2 film. It is shown that a decrease of DT by up to 27% compared to the absence of coating is feasible emphasising the impact of coatings of a lower refractive index than the substrate. Besides this, it is demonstrated that no absorption of energy occurs within the SiO2 layer, therefore the dynamics of the reflectivity of the two-layered complex is directly associated with the electron excitation in the substrate. These remarkable predictions can be employed for the development of new optical coatings and components for nonlinear optics and photonics for a large range of Mid-IR laser-based applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses pose unique tools to trigger and probe the fastest charge dynamics in matter, allowing the investigation of fundamental physical phenomena with unprecedented resolution in space, time, and energy. One of the most fascinating opportunities that ultrashort pulses offer is the possibility of modulating and investigating symmetries by tailoring the properties of the laser beam in the spatial and polarization domains, effectively controlling symmetry breaking on multiple levels. In particular, this allows probing chiral matter and ultrafast chiral dynamics. In recent years, the development of highly sensitive approaches for studying chirality has been a hot topic in physics and chemistry that has developed largely separately from the field of tailored light. This perspective discusses the individual and joint evolution of these fields with an emphasis on how the fields have already cross-fertilized, opening new opportunities in science. We outline a future outlook of how the topics are expected to fully merge and mutually evolve, emphasizing outstanding open issues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06708v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wigner distribution function and its spatial-angular moments (intensity-moments) are known as efficient instruments for characterization of complex quasimonochromatic light beams and their transformations. In this paper, the generalization of the WF-based approach to spatio-temporal (ST) light fields (wave packets, short pulses) is considered. It is shown that the ST intensity moments are related with the important characteristics of the wave-packet structure, especially, with the transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) being a specific feature of the ST optical vortices (STOV). The ST moments' transformations in a paraxial optical system obey simple and unified rules involving the ray-transfer ABCD-matrix of the system. On this base, and with simple examples of the OAM-carrying optical pulses, the schemes and mechanisms of the STOV generation and transformation are presented. Examples of non-vortex ST wave packets with the transverse OAM, their possible realizations are discussed as well as the relations between the OAM and the visible pulse rotations. The regular and unified formalism, developed in this paper, can be generalized and applied to more complex situations where the ST field propagates through inhomogeneous and random (scattering) media.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TES) are extremely sensitive microcalorimeters used as photon detectors with unparalleled energy resolution. They have found application from measuring astronomical spectra through to determining the quantum property of photon-number, $\hat{n} {=} \hat{a}^{\dag} \hat{a}$, for energies from 0.6-2.33eV. However, achieving optimal energy resolution requires considerable data acquisition -- on the order of 1GB/min -- followed by post-processing, which does not allow access to energy information in real time. Here we use a custom hardware processor to process TES pulses while new detections are still being registered, allowing photon-number to be measured in real time as well as reducing data requirements by orders-of-magnitude. We resolve photon number up to n=16 -- achieving up to parts-per-billion discrimination for low photon numbers on the fly -- providing transformational capacity for applications of TES detectors from astronomy through to quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of laser induced self-organized void array formation in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the formation of multi-voids in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using a multi-pulse irradiation method and explored the impact of laser energy, number of pulses per micron (writing speed), and laser spot size (NA) on the process. The experimental results revealed that multi-void formation occurred due to multi-pulse irradiation in the bulk of PDMS. Additionally, increasing laser energy led to an increase in the number of voids, while the number of voids did not change with an increase in the number of pulses per micron for a fixed laser parameter. However, the size of the voids increased with the number of pulses per micron, and tighter focusing conditions (higher NA) resulted in smaller voids with a shorter distance between them. Furthermore, Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations reproduced the generation of void arrays in PDMS using a similar multi-laser pulse approach. By modeling the voids as concentric spheres with densified shells and simulating the laser interaction with the voids, we showed that void array generation in PDMS is a linear mechanism. This study provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the formation of void arrays in PDMS. The simulation results agrees well with the experimental results to further validate the model and gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the generation of void arrays in PDMS.</description>

      <title>The LCLS-II Photoinjector Laser Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive technical overview of the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) photoinjector laser system, its first and foremost component. The LCLS-II photoinjector laser system serves as an upgrade to the original LCLS at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. This advanced laser system generates high-quality laser beams for LCLS-II, contributing to the instrument's unprecedented brightness, precision, and flexibility. Our discussion extends to the various subsystems that comprise the photoinjector, including the photocathode laser, laser heater, and beam transport systems. Lastly, we draw attention to the ongoing research and development infrastructure underway to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the LCLS-II, and similar X-ray free-electron laser facilities around the world, thereby contributing to the future of laser technology and its applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled metamaterial-phonon terahertz range polaritons in a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (TDTS) experiments demonstrating strong light-matter coupling in a terahertz (THz) LC-metamaterial in which the phonon resonance of a topological insulator (TI) thin film is coupled to the photonic modes of an array of electronic split-ring resonators. As we tune the metamaterial resonance frequency through the frequency of the low frequency $\alpha$ mode of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST), we observe strong mixing and level repulsion between phonon and metamaterial resonance. This hybrid resonance is a phonon polariton. We observe a normalized coupling strength, $\eta$ = $\Omega_R$/$\omega_c$ $\approx$ 0.09, using the measured vacuum Rabi frequency and cavity resonance. Our results demonstrate that one can tune the mechanical properties of materials by changing their electromagnetic environment and therefore modify their magnetic and topological degrees of freedom via coupling to the lattice in this fashion.</description>

      <title>Dirac plasmon polaritons and magnetic modes in topological-insulator nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of previously unreported magnetic modes with record-high magnetic Purcell factors in topological-insulator nanospheres. Focusing on bismuth selenide (Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$), and based on full electromagnetic Mie theory, we find magnetic modes arising from both displacement current loops in the bulk, and surface currents due to delocalized surface states, induced by electronic transitions between topologically protected states within the Dirac cone and discretized due to the sphere finite size. Furthermore, we discuss how Dirac plasmon polaritons, resulting from the interaction between THz photons and Dirac electrons, dramatically influence both the magnetic and the electric transitions of quantum emitters placed near Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanospheres, significantly enhancing the corresponding Purcell factors. These findings position Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ nanospheres, whose optical response is related to a richness of physical mechanisms, among the most promising candidates for enhancing light--matter interactions in nanophotonics and THz technologies.</description>

      <title>Conversion of twistedness from light to atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple model and propose a scheme that allows the production of twisted atoms in free space using the absorption of twisted photons by a bound electron. We show that in the inelastic collision of a photon and an atom, the twisted state of the photon is transferred to the center-of-mass state, so that the projection of the orbital momentum of the atom becomes $m_\gamma-\Delta m_e$. We also show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the twistedness of the photon is either transferred to the atomic center-of-mass quantum state or modifies the selection rule for the bound electron transition. Proposed scheme is general and enables complex shaping of the atomic wavefront.</description>
