      <title>Fast Feeder Reconfiguration via Mesh Adaptive Direct Search in Black-Box Distribution System Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feeder reconfiguration is a critical operational strategy in power distribution systems. However, existing optimization approaches typically rely on explicit mathematical formulations and analytical models, which are often infeasible in practical utility environments characterized by heterogeneous, proprietary, and black-box simulation modules. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fast feeder reconfiguration framework based on Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS). The proposed approach requires only performance metric evaluations through simulation modules used for power flow, protection, and voltage regulation analysis. A bi-objective formulation is adopted to jointly minimize active power loss and operational constraint violations. A Pareto-based frontier filter is integrated into the MADS algorithm to efficiently guide the search toward high-quality configurations while systematically pruning dominated solutions. The approach adaptively refines the search space around promising candidates using local polling strategies and convergence aware updates. Case studies on the IEEE-123 node test feeder demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal configurations with significantly fewer evaluations compared to heuristic methods.</description>

      <title>Analytical Framework for Power System Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general framework to evaluate power system strength. The formulation features twelve indicators, grouped in three dynamical orders, that quantify the resistance of bus voltage phasors and their first and second order rates of change to sudden current injection changes. To quantify such changes the paper introduces a novel finite differentiation technique, that we named Delta operator, able to properly capture "jumps" of algebraic variables and utilizes the recently developed concept of complex frequency. The paper also shows how the proposed framework can be systematically applied to any system device, and provides a variety of examples based on synchronous machines, converters and loads models are given. Numerical results in a benchmark system validate the exactness of the formulation.</description>

      <title>The Sustainability of the Leo Orbit Capacity via Risk-Driven Active Debris Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) jeopardizes long-term orbital sustainability, requiring efficient risk assessment for active debris removal (ADR) missions. This study presents the development and validation of Filtered Modified MITRI (FMM), an enhanced risk index designed to improve the prioritization of high-criticality debris. Leveraging the MOCAT-MC simulation framework, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis to probe the robustness of the FMM formulation. The results demonstrate that while the FMM provides superior identification of high-risk targets for annual removal campaigns, a nuanced performance trade-off exists between risk models depending on the operational removal cadence. The analysis also confirms that physically grounded mass terms are indispensable for practical risk assessment. By providing a validated open source tool and critical insights into the dynamics of risk, this research enhances our ability to select optimal ADR targets and ensure the long-term viability of LEO operations.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a Lightweight Object Detection System for Resource-Constrained Edge Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project aims to develop a system to run the object detection model under low power consumption conditions. The detection scene is set as an outdoor traveling scene, and the detection categories include people and vehicles. In this system, users data does not need to be uploaded to the cloud, which is suitable for use in environments with portable needs and strict requirements for data privacy. The MCU device used in this system is STM32H7, which has better performance among low power devices. The YOLOv5 system is selected to train the object detection model. To overcome the resource limitation of the embedded devices, this project uses several model compression techniques such as pruned, quantization, and distillation, which could improve the performance and efficiency of the detection model. Through these processes, the model s computation and the quantity of model parameters could be reduced, in order to run computer vision models on micro-controller devices for the development of embedded vision applications.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Wearables for Human Motion Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wearable electronics become increasingly prevalent, there is a rise in interest and demand for sustainably designed systems that are also energy self-sufficient. The research described in this paper investigated a shoe-worn energy harvesting system designed use the mechanical energy from walking to output electrical energy. A spring is attached to electromagnetic generator embedded in the heel of the shoe to recover the vertical pressure caused by the foot strike. The simulated prototype consisted of a standard EM generator designed in MATLAB demonstrating a maximum voltage of 12V. The initial low fidelity prototype demonstrated testing the relationship between the EM generator and a simple electrical circuit, with energy output observed. Future research will explore enhancing the overall generator design, integrate a power management IC for battery protect and regulation, and combine the system into a final product, wearable footwear. This research lays a foundation for self-powered footwear and energy independent wearable electronic devices.</description>

      <title>The Bode Plots for Sliding-Mode Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified frequency-domain framework for the analysis of sliding-mode control systems, encompassing both discontinuous and Lipschitz-continuous implementations. Using describing function (DF) theory, closed-form expressions are derived for the amplitude and frequency of chattering oscillations, as well as equivalent gain (EG) models that enable closed-loop sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology captures the influence of actuator dynamics, control parameters, and disturbance profiles on steady-state performance.
  Theoretical predictions for bias and oscillatory components are validated through simulations under both constant and sinusoidal perturbations. In the low-frequency regime, the EG-based sensitivity functions accurately predict the amplitude and phase of the system response, with tracking errors remaining within a 15\% margin, provided that the DF assumptions hold. The framework also incorporates orbital stability considerations via Loebs criterion, ensuring that chattering remains bounded.
  Overall, the results offer practical insight into the robust design of sliding-mode controllers, enabling systematic gain tuning that balances disturbance rejection and chattering attenuation, while accounting for actuator and sensor constraints.</description>

      <title>Polarforming Design for Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarforming has emerged as a promising technique to enable the antenna to shape its polarization into a desired state for aligning with that of the received electromagnetic (EM) wave or reconfiguring that of the transmitted EM wave. In this letter, we investigate polarforming design for the movable antenna (MA)-enabled communication system. Specifically, we consider a single-input single-output (SISO) system with reconfigurable antenna positions and polarizations to leverage both spatial and polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs). First, we present a polarized channel model and characterize the channel response as a function of antenna positions and polarforming phase shifts. To maximize the achievable rate of the proposed system, we then develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based optimization algorithm by iteratively optimizing the antenna positions and phase shifts at both the transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed system over conventional systems in mitigating channel depolarization and adapting to channel fading.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Agnostic Inference of Nonlinear Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inferring a hybrid automaton from a set of input-output traces of a hybrid system exhibiting discrete mode switching between continuously evolving dynamics. Existing approaches mainly adopt a derivative-based method where (i) the occurrence of mode switching is determined by a drastic variation in derivatives and (ii) the clustering of trace segments relies on signal similarity -- both subject to user-supplied thresholds. We present a derivative-agnostic approach, named Dainarx, to infer nonlinear hybrid systems where the dynamics are captured by nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) models. Dainarx employs NARX models as a unified, threshold-free representation through the detection of mode switching and trace-segment clustering. We show that Dainarx suffices to learn models that closely approximate a general class of hybrid systems featuring high-order nonlinear dynamics with exogenous inputs, nonlinear guard conditions, and linear resets. Experimental results on a collection of benchmarks indicate that our approach can effectively and efficiently infer nontrivial hybrid automata with high-order dynamics yielding significantly more accurate approximations than state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage Tactics in the Local Markets via Hierarchical Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic bidding tactics employed by prosumers in local markets, including the Local Electricity Market (LEM) and Local Flexibility Market (LFM), have attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance economic benefits for market participants through optimized energy management and bidding. While existing research has explored strategic bidding in a single market with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, arbitrage opportunities across local markets remain unexplored. This paper introduces a hierarchical MARL (HMARL) algorithm designed to enable aggregator arbitrage across multiple local markets. The strategic behavior of these aggregators in local markets is modeled as a two-stage Markov game: the first stage involves the LEM, while the second stage encompasses both the LFM and the balancing market. To solve this two-stage Markov game, the HMARL framework assigns two sub-agents to each aggregator, a primary sub-agent and a secondary sub-agent. Without the arbitrage strategy, these sub-agents operate in silos, with the primary sub-agent focusing on first-stage profits and the secondary sub-agent on second-stage profits, each employing independent MARLs. On the contrary, when implementing the arbitrage strategy with the proposed HMARL, the sub-agents communicate and coordinate to perform arbitrage across multiple local markets, enhancing overall efficiency. The case study, conducted under a scenario where all aggregators employ the arbitrage strategy, shows that despite higher initial costs in the LEM, this strategy generates substantial savings in the LFM and the balancing market, resulting in a total profit increase of $40.6\%$ on average. This highlights the capability of the proposed HMARL to address the two-stage Markov game and facilitate arbitrage across local markets, thereby enhancing profitability for participants.</description>

      <title>Graphical Analysis of Nonlinear Multivariable Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. There have been recent efforts to generalize SRG analysis to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. However, these attempts yielded only results for square systems, and in some cases, only methods applicable for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. In this paper, we develop a complete SRG framework for the analysis of MIMO systems, which may be nonlinear and non-square. The key element is the embedding of operators to a space of operators acting on a common Hilbert space, while restricting the input space to the original input dimension. We develop interconnection rules that use restricted input spaces and stability theorems to guarantee causality, well-posedness and (incremental) $L_2$-gain bounds for the overall interconnection. We show utilization of the proposed theoretical concepts on the analysis of nonlinear systems in a linear fractional representation form, which is a rather general class of systems with a representation form directly utilizable for control. Moreover, we provide formulas for the computation of MIMO SRGs of stable LTI operators and diagonal static nonlinear operators. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed approach on several examples.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Actor-Critic Algorithm for Fixed-Time Consensus in Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based backstepping control strategy to achieve fixed time consensus in nonlinear multi-agent systems with strict feedback dynamics. Agents exchange only output information with their neighbors over a directed communication graph, without requiring full state measurements or symmetric communication. Achieving fixed time consensus, where convergence occurs within a pre-specified time bound that is independent of initial conditions is faced with significant challenges due to the presence of unknown nonlinearities, inter-agent couplings, and external disturbances. This work addresses these challenges by integrating actor critic reinforcement learning with a novel fixed time adaptation mechanism. Each agent employs an actor critic architecture supported by two estimator networks designed to handle system uncertainties and unknown perturbations. The adaptation laws are developed to ensure that all agents track the leader within a fixed time regardless of their initial conditions. The consensus and tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, with the convergence radius adjustable through control parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.</description>

      <title>Integral action for bilinear systems with application to counter current heat exchanger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a robust control strategy for a counter-current heat exchanger. The primary objective is to regulate the outlet temperature of one fluid stream by manipulating the flow rate of the second counter-current fluid stream. By leveraging the energy balance equations, we develop a structured bilinear system model derived by using a uniform spatial discretization of each stream into a cascade of homogeneous volumes and by considering the heat transfer and convective phenomena within the exchanger. We introduce three control strategies: (i) an enhanced forwarding-based controller, (ii) an output feedback controller incorporating a state observer, and (iii) a purely integral control law. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through real experiments on a real heat exchanger.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Activation and Assignment of SDN Controllers in LEO Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a promising approach for managing traditional satellite communication. This enhances opportunities for future services, including integrating satellite and terrestrial networks. In this paper, we have developed an SDN-enabled framework for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, incorporating the OpenFlow protocol, all within an OMNeT++ simulation environment. Dynamic controller assignment is one of the most significant challenges for large LEO constellations. Due to the movement of LEO satellites, satellite-controller assignments must be updated frequently to maintain low propagation delays. To address this issue, we present a dynamic satellite-to-controller assignment (DSCA) optimization problem that continuously adjusts these assignments. Our optimal DSCA (Opt-DSCA) approach minimizes propagation delay and optimizes the number of active controllers. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the DSCA approach significantly outperforms the static satellite-to-controller assignment (SSCA) approach. While SSCA may perform better with more controllers, this scheme fails to adapt to satellite movements. Our DSCA approach consistently improves network efficiency by dynamically reassigning satellites based on propagation delays. Further, we found diminishing returns when the number of controllers is increased beyond a certain point, suggesting optimal performance with a limited number of controllers. Opt-DSCA lowers propagation delays and improves network performance by optimizing satellite assignments and reducing active controllers.</description>

      <title>Nd3+ Doping-induced Leakage Currents Suppression in High-temperature 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 Lead-free Piezoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BiFeO3 has attracted much attention as a potential candidate for replacing conventional, lead based piezoelectric materials due to its remarkable spontaneous polarization and high Curie temperature. However, its inherent high leakage currents, which lead to low piezoelectric response and poor temperature stability, have severely limited its practical applications. In this study, lead free piezoelectric ceramics of the 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 (BF-BT) system were prepared, and their microstructures along with high-temperature electrical performance were modulated by introducing Nd3+. The results indicate that moderate Nd doping improves lattice symmetry and reduces oxygen vacancy-related defect dipoles, thereby effectively suppressing leakage currents at temperatures above 75{\deg}C. The Nddoped samples exhibit significantly lower leakage current densities, reduced by over 99% compared to the undoped ceramics, reaching values as low as 10-5Acm-2. They also show higher resistivity under elevated temperatures and electric fields, offering notable improvements in thermal stability over the undoped counterparts. In addition, the Nd-doped samples achieved piezoelectric coefficients as high as 172 pC N -1 at room temperature while still maintaining high dielectric and piezoelectric responses at elevated temperatures. This work not only provides an effective way to solve the leakage current problem of BF-BT ceramics in high temperature applications but also indicates a new design strategy for optimizing the high temperature stability of lead free piezoelectric materials, which shows a broad application prospect in the field of high-temperature sensors and actuators.</description>

      <title>Unbeatable imitation of a friend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation sometimes achieves success in multi-agent situations even though it is very simple. In game theory, success of imitation has been characterized by unbeatability against other agents. Previous studies specified conditions under which imitation is unbeatable in repeated games, and clarified that the existence of unbeatable imitation is strongly related to the existence of payoff-controlling strategies, called zero-determinant strategies. However, the previous studies mainly focused on ``imitation of opponents''. It was pointed out that imitation of other players in the same group and imitation of other players in the same role in other groups generally result in different outcomes. Here, we investigate the existence condition of unbeatable imitation in the latter ``imitation of friends'' situations. We find that it is stronger than the existence condition of unbeatable zero-determinant strategies, whereas both are very limited. Our findings suggest a strong relation between them even in the `imitation of friends'' situations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Oscillatory Guidance for Formation Flight of Fixed-Wing Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autonomous formation flight of fixed-wing drones is hard when the coordination requires the actuation over their speeds since they are critically bounded and aircraft are mostly designed to fly at a nominal airspeed. This paper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones without requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all the drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we superpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the drones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity along the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone adjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by communicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A novel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric saturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative amplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along the path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by validation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight.</description>

      <title>Designing for Difference: How Human Characteristics Shape Perceptions of Collaborative Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations.</description>

      <title>Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Spiking neurons as predictive controllers of linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events directly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking neural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal, necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in neuromorphic hardware design.</description>

      <title>Node Reliability: Approximation, Upper Bounds, and Applications to Network Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the reliability of a graph in which the links are perfectly reliable but the nodes may fail with certain probability p. Calculating graph node reliability is an NP-Hard problem. We introduce an efficient and accurate Monte Carlo method and a stochastic approximation for the node reliability polynomial based solely on the degree distribution. We provide the formulas for the node reliability polynomial of both Erdos-Renyi graphs and Random Geometric graphs. The phase transition in the node reliability of Erdos-Renyi graphs is also discussed. Additionally, we propose two increasingly accurate upper bounds for the node reliability polynomial solely based on the graph's degree distributions. The advantages and disadvantages of these two upper bounds are thoroughly compared. Beyond the computation of node reliability polynomials, we also estimate the number of cut sets and present a solution to the reliability-based network enhancement problem.</description>

      <title>Integrating and Comparing Radiality Constraints for Optimized Distribution System Reconfiguration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconfiguration of electrical power distribution systems is a crucial optimization problem aimed at minimizing power losses by altering the system topology through the operation of interconnection switches. This problem, typically modelled as a mixed integer nonlinear program demands high computational resources for large scale networks and requires specialized radiality constraints for maintaining the tree like structure of distribution networks. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis that integrates and compares the computational burden associated with different radiality constraint formulations proposed in the specialized literature for the reconfiguration of distribution systems. By using consistent hardware and software setups, we evaluate the performance of these constraints across several well known test cases. Our findings reveal significant differences in computational efficiency depending on the chosen set of radiality constraints, providing valuable insights for optimizing reconfiguration strategies in practical distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Nonlinear Parametric Models under Non-smooth Regularization using EKF and ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for learning parametric nonlinear models online under non-smooth regularization terms, including l1 and l0 penalties and bound constraints on model parameters. For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Distributed Optimal Control for Linear Networked Systems: An Online Distributed Training Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the distributed optimal control problem for discrete-time linear networked systems. In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</description>

      <title>Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>GenControl: Generative AI-Driven Autonomous Design of Control Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing controllers for complex industrial electronic systems is challenging due to nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, and traditional methods are often slow and costly. To address this, we propose a novel autonomous design framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy: an LLM intelligently explores and iteratively improves the control algorithm's structure, while a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently refines the parameters for any given structure. This method achieves end-to-end automated design. Validated through a simulation of a DC-DC Boost converter, our framework successfully evolved a basic controller into a high-performance adaptive version that met all stringent design specifications for fast response, low error, and robustness. This work presents a new paradigm for control design that significantly enhances automation and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a decomposition for the gradient of the innovation loss with respect to the filter gain in a linear time-invariant system, decomposing as a product of an observability Gramian and a term quantifying the ``non-orthogonality" between the estimation error and the innovation. We leverage this decomposition to give a convergence proof of gradient descent to the optimal Kalman gain, specifically identifying how recovery of the Kalman gain depends on a non-standard observability condition, and obtaining an interpretable geometric convergence rate.</description>
