      <title>Exploring the effects of dark matter - dark energy interaction on cosmic evolution in viscous dark energy scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the influence of interactions between dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) on the cosmic evolution of the Universe within a viscous dark energy (VDE) framework. Moving beyond traditional interacting dark energy (IDE) models, we propose a generalized IDE model adaptable to diverse IDE scenarios via IDE coupling parameters. In order to investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM across cosmic epochs by highlighting how viscous and the interactions between DM and DE impact cosmic density and expansion rates, we consider a model agnostic form of VDE. Eventually we perform a Bayesian analysis using the Union 2.1 Supernova Ia dataset and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to obtain optimal values of model parameters. This comprehensive analysis provides insights about the interplay between viscous and IDE in shaping the Universe's expansion history.</description>

      <title>On the nature of LOFAR RMs and new constraints on magnetic fields in cosmic filaments and on magnetogenesis scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of magnetic fields in cosmic web filaments can be used to reveal the magnetogenesis of the Universe. In previous work, we produced first estimates of the field strength and its redshift evolution using the Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) catalogue of extragalactic background sources at low frequency obtained with LOFAR observations. Here we refine our analysis by selecting sources with low Galactic RM, which reduces its residual contamination. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the different contributions to the extragalactic RMs along the line of sight, and confirm that they are dominated by the cosmic filaments component, with only 21 percent originating in galaxy clusters and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. We find a possible hint of a shock at the virial radius of massive galaxies. We also find that the fractional polarization of background sources might be a valuable CGM tracer. The newly selected RMs have a steeper evolution with redshift than previously found. The field strength in filaments ($B_f$) and its evolution are estimated assuming $B_f$ evolves as a power-law $B_f=B_{f,0}\,(1+z)^\alpha$. Our analysis finds an average strength at $z=0$ of $B_{f,0} =11$--15~nG, with an error of 4 nG, and a slope $\alpha=2.3$--$2.6 \pm 0.5$, which is steeper than what we previously found. The comoving field has a slope of $\beta=$ [0.3, 0.6$]\pm 0.5$ that is consistent with being invariant with redshift. Primordial magnetogenesis scenarios are favoured by our data, together with a sub-dominant astrophysical-origin RM component increasing with redshift.</description>

      <title>On the Cosmological Constant-Graviton Mass correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relations between the graviton mass and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ have led to some interesting implications. We show that in any approach which leads to a direct correlation between the graviton mass and $\Lambda$, either through direct substitution of gravitational coupling in dispersion relations or through the linearization of Einstein equations with massive spin-2 fields, the Compton wavelength of the graviton lies in the superhorizon scale. As a result any gravitational approaches where the graviton mass is related directly to the cosmological constant are of no observational significance.</description>

      <title>Mapping Galactic Dust Emission and Extinction with HI, HII, and H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) emission closely traces the dust column density at high Galactic latitudes and is thus a powerful tool for predicting dust extinction. However, the relation between HI column density $N_{\rm HI}$ and high-latitude dust emission observed by Planck has large-scale residuals at the level of $\lesssim 20\%$ on tens of degree scales. In this work, we improve HI-based dust templates in the North/South Galactic poles covering a sky fraction of $f_{\rm sky}=13.5\%/11.0\%$ (5,577/4,555 deg$^2$) by incorporating data from ionized (HII) and molecular (H$_2$) gas phases. We make further improvements by employing a clustering analysis on the HI spectral data to identify discrete clouds with distinct dust properties. However, only a modest reduction in fitting residuals is achieved. We quantify the contributions to these residuals from variations in the dust-to-gas ratio, dust temperature and opacity, and magnetic field orientation using ancillary datasets. Although residuals in a few particular regions can be attributed to these factors, no single explanation accounts for the majority. We derive an upper limit on the high-latitude dust temperature variation of $\sigma_T&lt;1.28$ K, lower than the temperature variation reported in previous studies. Joint analysis of multiple existing and upcoming datasets that trace Galactic gas and dust properties is needed to clarify the origins of the variation of gas and dust properties found here and to significantly improve gas-based extinction maps.</description>

      <title>Kicking the Tires on Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2\times 10^{-16}M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}}\sim 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>HiFAST: An HI Data Calibration and Imaging Pipeline for FAST III. Standing Wave Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standing waves existed in radio telescope data are primarily due to reflections among the instruments, which significantly impact the spectrum quality of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Eliminating these standing waves for FAST is challenging given the constant changes in their phases and amplitudes. Over a ten-second period, the phases shift by 18$^{\circ}$ while the amplitudes fluctuate by 6 mK. Thus, we developed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) filter method to eliminate these standing waves for every individual spectrum. The FFT filter can decrease the root mean square (RMS) from 3.2 to 1.15 times the theoretical estimate. Compared to other methods such as sine fitting and running median, the FFT filter achieves a median RMS of approximately 1.2 times the theoretical expectation and the smallest scatter at 12%. Additionally, the FFT filter method avoids the flux loss issue encountered with some other methods. The FFT is also efficient in detecting harmonic radio frequency interference (RFI). In the FAST data, we identified three distinct types of harmonic RFI, each with amplitudes exceeding 100 mK and intrinsic frequency periods of 8.1, 0.5, and 0.37 MHz, respectively. The FFT filter, proven as the most effective method, is integrated into the HI data calibration and imaging pipeline for FAST (HiFAST, https://hifast.readthedocs.io).</description>

      <title>Updates on the density of states method in finite temperature symplectic gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early universe have rich phenomenological implications, such as the production of a potentially detectable signal of stochastic relic background gravitational waves. The hypothesis that new, strongly coupled dynamics, hiding in a new dark sector, could be detected in this way, via the telltale signs of its confinement/deconfinement phase transition, provides a fascinating opportunity for interdisciplinary synergy between lattice field theory and astro-particle physics. But its viability relies on completing the challenging task of providing accurate theoretical predictions for the parameters characterising the strongly coupled theory. Density of states methods, and in particular the linear logarithmic relaxation (LLR) method, can be used to address the intrinsic numerical difficulties that arise due the meta-stable dynamics in the vicinity of the critical point. For example, it allows one to obtain accurate determinations of thermodynamic observables that are otherwise inaccessible, such as the free energy. In this contribution, we present an update on results of the analysis of the finite temperature deconfinement phase transition in a pure gauge theory with a symplectic gauge group, $Sp(4)$, by using the LLR method. We present a first analysis of the properties of the transition in the thermodynamic limit, and provide a road map for future work, including a brief preliminary discussion that will inform future publications.</description>

      <title>The Composite Spectral Energy Distribution of Quasars is Surprisingly Universal Since Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), we construct mean/median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for unique bright quasars in redshift bins of 0.2 and up to $z \simeq 3$, after taking the GALEX non-detection into account. Further correcting for the absorption of the intergalactic medium, these mean/median quasar SEDs constitute a surprisingly redshift-independent mean/median composite SED from the rest-frame optical down to $\simeq 500~{\rm \mathring A}$ for quasars with bolometric luminosity brighter than $10^{45.5}~{\rm erg s^{-1}}$. Moreover, the mean/median composite quasar SED is plausibly also independent of black hole mass and Eddington ratio, and suggests similar properties of dust and gas in the quasar host galaxies since cosmic noon. Both the mean and median composite SEDs are nicely consistent with previous mean composite quasar spectra at wavelengths beyond $\simeq 1000~{\rm \mathring A}$, but at shorter wavelengths, are redder, indicating, on average, less ionizing radiation than previously expected. Through comparing the model-predicted to the observed composite quasar SEDs, we favor a simply truncated disk model, rather than a standard thin disk model, for the quasar central engine, though we request more sophisticated disk models. Future deep ultraviolet facilities, such as the China Space Station Telescope and the Ultraviolet Explorer, would prompt revolutions in many aspects, including the quasar central engine, production of the broad emission lines in quasars, and cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Metastable Cosmic Strings in Supersymmetric New Inflation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) indicate a potential detection of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Metastable cosmic strings have been recognized as a possible source of the observed signals. In this paper, we propose an $R$-invariant supersymmetric new inflation model. It is characterized by a two-step symmetry breaking $\mathrm{SU}(2) \to \mathrm{U}(1)_G \to \mathrm{nothing}$, incorporating metastable cosmic strings. The field responsible for the initial symmetry breaking acts as the inflaton, while the second symmetry breaking occurs post-inflation, ensuring the formation of the cosmic string network without monopole production. Our model predicts symmetry breaking scales consistent with the string tensions favored by PTA data, $G_\mathrm{N} \mu_\mathrm{str} \sim 10^{-5}$, where $G_\mathrm{N}$ is the Newton constant. Notably, a low reheating temperature is required to suppress non-thermal gravitino production from the decay of inflaton sector fields. This also helps evading LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, while yielding a distinctive GW signature that future PTA and interferometer experiments can detect. Additionally, we examine the consistency of this scenario with non-thermal leptogenesis and supersymmetric dark matter.</description>

      <title>Effective Actions for Domain Wall Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to derive the effective action for domain walls directly from the scalar field theory that gives rise to their solitonic solutions. The effective action for the Goldstone mode, which characterizes the soliton's position, is shown to consist of the Nambu-Goto action supplemented by higher-order curvature invariants associated to its worldvolume metric. Our approach constrains the corrections to a finite set of Galileon terms, specifying both their functional forms and the procedure to compute their coefficients. We do a collection of tests across various models in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions that confirm the validity of this framework. Additionally, the method is extended to include bound scalar fields living on the worldsheet, along with their couplings to the Goldstone mode. These interactions reveal a universal non-minimal coupling of these scalar fields to the Ricci scalar on the worldsheet. A significant consequence of this coupling is the emergence of a parametric instability, driven by interactions between the bound states and the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <title>Sibling Rivalry: Thermonuclear Diversity and the Hubble Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogeneity is the hallmark of standard candle-based cosmology investigations. Thermonuclear supernovae (Type-Ia, SNeIa) violate this essential requirement if they develop along multiple evolutionary pathways. In this work, the impact of thermonuclear diversity on cosmological parameter constraints is quantified using Pantheon+, one of the largest ensembles of SNeIa compiled to probe cosmology to date. Evidence of diversity is encoded in supernova light curves. Pantheon+ is shown to be diverse, with features indicative of multiple thermonuclear sub-classes. Diversity-driven systematic effects have been quantified on a supernova-by-supernova basis; event selections based on light curve-derived metrics were subsequently used to characterize diversity-dependent trends and mitigate their impact. A "diversity free" estimate of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre parameter, $H_0$=$67.5\pm3.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (68\% C.L.), was obtained by reanalyzing Pantheon+. The Hubble Tension, an apparent disparity between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, is eased from $\sim$$5\sigma$ to $&lt;$$1\sigma$ after accounting for the diverse thermonuclear scenarios that govern SNeIa. A strategy for precise determination of $H_0$, dominated by statistical rather than systematic uncertainties, is also presented.</description>

      <title>Nearly-zero large-angle anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global isotropy of the universe is analyzed on the scale of the cosmic horizon, using the angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature at large angular separation $\Theta$. Even-parity correlation $C_{even}(\Theta)$ is introduced as a direct, precise measure of horizon-scale cosmic anisotropy, independent of the unknown dipole. Correlation in maps from {\sl Planck} at $\Theta\simeq 90^\circ\pm 15^\circ$ is found to be much smaller than in any previous studies. Allowing for measurement errors introduced by Galaxy subtraction, it is shown to be consistent with zero, with an absolute value three to four orders of magnitude smaller than expected in standard theory. Such a small variation from zero is estimated to occur by chance in a fraction $\simeq 10^{-4.3}$ to $\simeq 10^{-2.8}$ of standard realizations. We also consider an alternative interpretation of this result, as a signature of a new causal symmetry of cosmological initial conditions. The measured zero-correlation angular interval is derived geometrically by assuming that quantum fluctuation states have spacelike coherence bounded by compact causal diamonds, and that they convert into classical perturbations when world lines cross horizons. This process differs from the unbounded spacelike coherent evolution and freezing assumed in standard theory. It is argued that such a scale-invariant causal angular symmetry of initial conditions is broadly consistent with cosmological measurements on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We confirm the previous finding in the literature that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at a similar significance level ($3.2\sigma$) when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. The computationally efficient $\theta_\star$ and $\Omega_bh^2$ priors allow us to take a frequentist approach by comparing DES5YR SNe and DESI BAO with a large number ($\gtrsim 10^4$) of Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find that $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy is very rare (occurrence rate = $0.28\%$) in simulations. When we combine DESI BAO with SN simulations or combine DES5YR SNe with BAO simulations, the occurrence rate of $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy increases to $1.2\%$ and $4.8\%$, respectively. These results indicate an internal inconsistency, i.e., a significant tension between DESI BAO + DES5YR SNe and Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models in both Bayesian and frequentist points of view. Although both DESI BAO and DES5YR SNe contribute to the preference for dynamic dark energy, the contribution from DES5YR SNe is more significant. In the frequentist point of view, even DES5YR SNe alone is in tension with Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models, though in Bayesian point of view this tension is prior dependent and inclusive.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational wave backgrounds from phase transitions with next generation ground based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Third generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will operate in the $(\text{few}-10^4)$ Hz frequency band, with a boost in sensitivity providing an unprecedented reach into primordial cosmology. Working concurrently with pulsar timing arrays in the nHz band, and LISA in the mHz band, these 3G detectors will be powerful probes of beyond the standard model particle physics on scales $T\gtrsim 10^{7}$GeV. Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early universe. We first overview the landscape of detectors across frequencies, discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss their spectrum and summarise the expected constraints on these models from 3G detectors, together with SKA and LISA.</description>

      <title>Bayesian recalibration of Planck galaxy cluster scaling relations including relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of relativistic SZ corrections on Planck measurements of massive galaxy clusters, finding that they have a significant impact at the $\approx$5 -- 15% and up to $\approx 3\sigma$ level. We investigate the possibility of constraining temperature directly from these SZ measurements but find that only weak constraints are possible for the most significant detections; for most clusters, an external temperature measurement is required to correctly measure integrated Compton-$y$. We also investigate the impact of profile shape assumptions and find that these have a small but non-negligible impact on measured Compton-$y$, at the $\approx$5% level.
  Informed by the results of these investigations, we recalibrate the Planck SZ observable-mass scaling relation, using the updated NPIPE data release and a larger sample of X-ray mass estimates. Along with the expected change in the high-mass end of the scaling relation, which does not impact Planck mass estimation, we also find hints of a low-mass deviation but this requires better understanding of the selection function in order to confirm.</description>

      <title>Capturing primordial non-Gaussian signatures in the late Universe by multi-scale extrema of the cosmic log-density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two new summary statistics, the scale-dependent peak height function (scale-PKHF) and the scale-dependent valley depth function (scale-VLYDF) of matter density, and forecast their constraining power on primordial non-Gaussianity and cosmological parameters based on \textsc{Quijote} and \textsc{Quijote-PNG} simulations at $z=0$. With the Fisher analysis, we demonstrate that these statistics outperform the power spectrum and bispectrum. Key findings include: (1) the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ obtained from the scale-VLYDF/scale-PKHF is 1.59/1.10 times tighter than that from the joint analysis of power spectrum and bispectrum; (2) the combination of the two statistics yields a slight improvement in constraining $\{f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local}, f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil}\}$ over the power spectrum-bispectrum combination, and provides a 1.39-fold improvement in the constraint on $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{ortho}$; (3) after incorporating the power spectrum with our new statistics, parameter constraints surpass those from power spectrum-bispectrum combination by factors up to 2.93. This work offers an effective scheme for extracting primordial signals from the late Universe, paving the way for further breakthroughs in precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraints on compact objects from the Dark Energy Survey five-year supernova sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) allows information to be obtained about the distribution of matter on small scales. In this paper, we derive limits on the fraction $\alpha$ of the total matter density in compact objects (which comprise stars, stellar remnants, small stellar groupings and primordial black holes) of mass $M &gt; 0.03 M_{\odot}$ over cosmological distances. Using 1,532 SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 sample (DES-SN5YR) combined with a Bayesian prior for the absolute magnitude $M$, we obtain $\alpha &lt; 0.12$ at the 95\% confidence level after marginalisation over cosmological parameters, lensing due to large-scale structure, and intrinsic non-Gaussianity. Similar results are obtained using priors from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy weak lensing, indicating our results do not depend on the background cosmology. We argue our constraints are likely to be conservative (in the sense of the values we quote being higher than the truth), but discuss scenarios in which they could be weakened by systematics of the order of $\Delta \alpha \sim 0.04$</description>

      <title>Darkness Visible: N-Body Simulations of Dark Matter Spikes in Hernquist Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter is theorised to form massive haloes, which could be further condensed into so-called spikes when a black hole grows at the centre of such a halo. The existence of these spikes is instrumental for several dark matter detection schemes such as indirect detection and imprints on gravitational wave inspirals, but all previous work on their formation has been (semi-)analytical. We present fully numerically simulated cold dark matter spikes using the SWIFT code. Based on these results, we propose a simple empirical density profile - dependent on only a single mass-ratio parameter between the black hole and total mass - for dark matter spikes grown in Hernquist profiles. We find that the radius of the spike scales differently compared to theoretical predictions, and show a depletion of the outer halo that is significant for high mass-ratio systems. We critically assess approximations of the spike as used in the field, show that our profile significantly deviates, and contextualise the potential influence for future dark matter detections by simulating binary black hole inspirals embedded in our profile.</description>

      <title>Physical Models for the Astrophysical Population of Black Holes: Application to the Bump in the Mass Distribution of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of binary black holes have revealed unexpected structure in the black hole mass distribution. Previous studies of the mass distribution employ physically-motivated phenomenological models and infer the parameters that directly control the features of the mass distribution that are allowed in their model, associating the constraints on those parameters with their physical motivations. In this work, we take an alternative approach in which we introduce a model parameterizing the underlying stellar and core-collapse physics and obtaining the remnant black hole distribution as a derived byproduct. In doing so, we directly constrain the stellar physics necessary to explain the astrophysical distribution of black hole properties under a given model. We apply this approach to modeling the mapping between stellar core mass and remnant black hole mass, including the effects of mass loss due to the pulsational pair instability supernova (PPISN) process, which has been proposed as an explanation for the observed excess of black holes at $\sim 35 M_\odot$. Placing constraints on the nuclear reaction rates necessary to explain the PPISN parameters, we conclude that the peak observed at $\sim 35 M_\odot$ is highly unlikely to be a signature from the PPISN process. This procedure can be applied to modeling any physical process that underlies the astrophysical mass distribution. Allowing the parameters of the core-remnant mass relationship to evolve with redshift permits correlated and physically reasonable changes in the location, shape, and amplitude of features in the mass function. We find that the current data are consistent with no redshift evolution in the core-remnant mass relationship, but ultimately place only weak constraints on the change of these parameters.</description>

      <title>New realisation of light thermal dark matter with enhanced detection prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light dark matter (DM) with mass around the GeV scale faces weaker bounds from direct detection experiments. If DM couples strongly to a light mediator, it is possible to have observable direct detection rate. However, this also leads to a thermally under-abundant DM relic due to efficient annihilation into light mediators. We propose a novel scenario where a first-order phase transition (FOPT) occurring at MeV scale can restore GeV scale DM relic by changing the mediator mass sharply at the nucleation temperature. The MeV scale FOPT predicts stochastic gravitational waves with nano-Hz frequencies within reach of pulsar timing array (PTA) based experiments like NANOGrav. In addition to enhancing direct detection rate, the light mediator can also give rise to the required DM self-interactions necessary to solve the small scale structure issues of cold dark matter. The existence of light scalar mediator and its mixing with the Higgs keep the scenario verifiable at different particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified super-radiance towards hot big bang universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of preheating stage after inflation, using a new idea of parametrically amplified super-radiance. Highly coherent state, characterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless particle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with field oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The state is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance model, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying neglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change their energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang universe. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be solved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized universe is suggested as well.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos with gravitational wave and $\gamma$-ray burst joint observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to detect them. Future gravitational wave (GW) observations can precisely measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies generated by traditional cosmological observations. This advancement can lead to much tighter constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. This work provides a preliminary forecast for detecting sterile neutrinos using third-generation GW detectors in combination with future short $\gamma$-ray burst observations from a THESEUS-like telescope, an approach not previously explored in the literature. Both massless and massive sterile neutrinos are considered within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that using GW data can greatly enhance the detection capability for massless sterile neutrinos, reaching 3$\sigma$ level. For massive sterile neutrinos, GW data can also greatly assist in improving the parameter constraints, but it seems that effective detection is still not feasible.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>
