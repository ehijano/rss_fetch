      <title>Electronic Energy Singularities of Weakly H-bonded Ammonium Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum and molecular mechanics based electronic energy studies of weak H-bonded ammonium dimer show distinctive feature in energy profile when computed by different QM methods contrast to MM methods. MM based MMFF and SYBYL methods show smoothly varying dihedral energy profile for torsion angle variation around weak N1-H5 held by H-bond strength of around 13 KJ/mol. All the QM based methods HF, B3LYP and MP2 show noisy and unstable torsion dependent electronic energy profile for H-bonded ammonium dimer. Exploring energy surface beyond bond length shows singularities and discontinuities. QM-based computation of dipole moment shows several discreet values with jumps and discontinuities with torsion angle variation for ammonium dimer. Also repeated computations and reverse torsion energy profile show persistent singularity feature observed in all standard QM techniques.

      <title>Compact Gaussian basis sets for stochastic DFT calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents new Gaussian single- and double-zeta basis sets optimized for stochastic density functional theory (sDFT) using real-space auxiliary grids. Previous studies showed standard basis sets like STO-3G and 6-31G are sub-optimal for this approach. Our basis-set's Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) resemble norm-conserving pseudo-orbitals for H, C, N, O, F, and Si, but minimize real-space and momentum-space support. These basis sets achieve accuracy comparable to established sets while offering improved efficiency for sDFT calculations with auxiliary grids.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of CO$_2$ chemisorption in an amine-functionalized metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a series of calculations using simulated QPUs, accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, focusing on a molecular analog of an amine-functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF) -- a promising class of materials for CO2 capture. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique is employed, utilizing the unitary coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (UCCSD) within active spaces extracted from the larger material system. We explore active spaces of (6e,6o), (10e,10o), and (12e,12o), corresponding to 12, 20, and 24 qubits, respectively, and simulate them using CUDA-Q's GPU-accelerated state-vector simulator. Notably, the 24-qubit simulations -- among the largest of their kind to date -- are enabled by gate fusion optimizations available in CUDA-Q. While these active space sizes are among the largest reported in the context of CO2 chemisorption, they remain insufficient for a fully accurate study of the system. This limitation arises from necessary simplifications and scalability challenges of VQE, particularly the barren plateau problem. Nonetheless, this work demonstrates the application of VQE to a novel material system using large-scale simulated QPUs and offers a blueprint for future quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>The need for statistical physics in Africa: perspective and an illustration in drug delivery problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of statistical physics in Africa is in its nascent stages, yet its application holds immense promise for advancing emerging research trends on the continent. This perspective paper, a product of a two-week workshop on biophysics in Morogoro (Tanzania), aims to illuminate the potential of statistical physics in regional scientific research. We employ in-silico atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the loading and delivery capabilities of lecithin nanolipids for niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug. Our simulations reveal that the loading capacity and interaction strength between lecithin nanolipids and niclosamide improve with increased lecithin concentrations. We perform a free-energy landscape analysis which uncovers two distinct metastable conformations of niclosamide within both the aqueous phase and the lecithin nanolipids. Over a simulation period of half a microsecond, lecithin nanolipids self-assemble into a spherical monolayer structure, providing detailed atomic-level insights into their interactions with niclosamide. These findings underscore the potential of lecithin nanolipids as efficient drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. However, this approach involves averaging of the particles in a non-physically meaningful way resulting in inaccurate centres of mass. Instead the intrinsic weighted average should be computed, but the analytical calculation of this is computationally expensive and complex. Here, we propose a more computationally efficient approach to compute the intrinsic mean suitable for the majority of chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Long-term excitation energy transfer predicted by a modified convolutional neural networks in the FMO complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>From short-sighted to far-sighted: A comparative study of recursive machine learning approaches for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling open quantum system dynamics is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, yet traditional methods struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency. Machine learning (ML) provides a promising alternative, particularly through recursive models that predict system evolution based on past history. While these models have shown success in predicting single observables, their effectiveness in more complex tasks, such as forecasting the full reduced density matrix (RDM), remains unclear. We extend history-based recursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four physics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting PINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii) multi-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation parameters (PMR-PINN). These models are applied to the spin-boson (SB) model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our results show that SR-PINN and PSR-PINN, constrained by a narrow history window, fail to capture complex quantum evolution, leading to unstable long-term predictions, especially in nonlinear and highly correlated dynamics. In contrast, MR-PINN and PMR-PINN improve accuracy by extending the forecast horizon, incorporating long-range correlations, and reducing error propagation. Surprisingly, explicitly including simulation parameters such as temperature and reorganization energy in PSR-PINN and PMR-PINN does not consistently enhance accuracy and can even reduce performance, suggesting that these effects are already encoded in the RDM evolution. These findings highlight the limitations of short-sighted recursive forecasting and demonstrate the superior stability and accuracy of far-sighted approaches for long-term predictions.</description>

      <title>Static linear density response from X-ray Thomson scattering measurements: a case study of warm dense beryllium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear response theory is ubiquitous throughout physics and plays a central role in the theoretical description of warm dense matter -- an extreme state that occurs within compact astrophysical objects and that is traversed on the compression path of a fuel capsule in inertial confinement fusion applications. Here we show how one can relate the static linear density response function to X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements, which opens up new possibilities for the diagnostics of extreme states of matter, and for the rigorous assessment and verification of theoretical models and approximations. As a practical example, we consider an XRTS data set of warm dense beryllium taken at the National Ignition Facility [T.~D\"oppner \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature} \textbf{618}, 270-275 (2023)]. The comparison with state-of-the-art \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations [T.~Dornheim \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature Commun.}~(in print), arXiv:2402.19113] gives us a best estimate of the mass density of $\rho=18\pm6\,$g/cc, which is consistent with previous PIMC and density functional theory based studies, but rules out the original estimate of $\rho=34\pm4\,$g/cc based on a Chihara model fit.</description>
