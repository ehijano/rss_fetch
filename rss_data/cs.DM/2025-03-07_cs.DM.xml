      <title>Foundations of block-parallel automata networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle the theoretical ground for the study of automata networks under block-parallel update schedules, which are somehow dual to the block-sequential ones, but allow for repetitions of automaton updates. This gain in expressivity brings new challenges, and we analyse natural equivalence classes of update schedules: those leading to the same dynamics, and to the same limit dynamics, for any automata network. Countings and enumeration algorithms are provided, for their numerical study. We also prove computational complexity bounds for many classical problems, involving fixed points, limit cycles, the recognition of subdynamics, reachability, etc. The PSPACE-completeness of computing the image of a single configuration lifts the complexity of most problems, but the landscape keeps some relief, in particular for reversible computations.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds in the Apex Minor Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $A$ is "apex" if $A-z$ is planar for some vertex $z\in V(A)$. Eppstein [Algorithmica, 2000] showed that for a minor-closed class $\mathcal{G}$, the graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ with bounded radius have bounded treewidth if and only if some apex graph is not in $\mathcal{G}$. In particular, for every apex graph $A$ and integer $r$, there is a minimum integer $g(A,r)$ such that every $A$-minor-free graph with radius $r$ has treewidth at most $g(A,r)$. We show that if $t=|V(A)|$ then $g(A,r)\in O^\ast(r^9t^{18})$ which is the first upper bound on $g(A,r)$ with polynomial dependence on both $r$ and $t$. More precisely, we show that every $A$-minor-free graph with radius $r$ has no $16rt^2 \times 16rt^2$ grid minor, which implies the first result via the Polynomial Grid Minor Theorem. A key example of an apex graph is the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,t}$, since $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graphs include and generalise graphs embeddable in any fixed surface. In this case, we prove that every $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graph with radius $r$ has no $4r(1+\sqrt{t})\times 4r(1+\sqrt{t})$ grid minor, which is tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Positionality of Dumont--Thomas numeration systems for integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced in 2001 by Lecomte and Rigo, abstract numeration systems provide a way of expressing natural numbers with words from a language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton. As it turns out, these numeration systems are not necessarily positional, i.e., we cannot always find a sequence $U=(U_i)_{i\ge 0}$ of integers such that the value of every word in the language $L$ is determined by the position of its letters and the first few values of $U$. Finding the conditions under which an abstract numeration system is positional seems difficult in general. In this paper, we thus consider this question for a particular sub-family of abstract numeration systems called Dumont--Thomas numeration systems. They are derived from substitutions and were introduced in 1989 by Dumont and Thomas. We exhibit conditions on the underlying substitution so that the corresponding Dumont--Thomas numeration is positional. We first work in the most general setting, then particularize our results to some practical cases. Finally, we link our numeration systems to existing literature, notably properties studied by R\'{e}nyi in 1957, Parry in 1960, Bertrand-Mathis in 1989, and Fabre in 1995.</description>

      <title>Source-Oblivious Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the study of (minimum) broadcast graphs, i.e., graphs enabling fast information dissemination from every source node to all the other nodes (and having minimum number of edges for this property). This study is performed in the framework of compact distributed data structures, that is, when the broadcast protocols are bounded to be encoded at each node as an ordered list of neighbors specifying, upon reception of a message, in which order this message must be passed to these neighbors. We show that this constraint does not limit the power of broadcast protocols, as far as the design of (minimum) broadcast graphs is concerned. Specifically, we show that, for every~$n$, there are $n$-node graphs for which it is possible to design protocols encoded by lists yet enabling broadcast in $\lceil\log_2n\rceil$ rounds from every source, which is optimal even for general (i.e., non space-constrained) broadcast protocols. Moreover, we show that, for every~$n$, there exist such graphs with the additional property that they are asymptotically as sparse as the sparsest graphs for which $\lceil\log_2n\rceil$-round broadcast protocols exist, up to a constant multiplicative factor. Concretely, these graphs have $O(n\cdot L(n))$ edges, where $L(n)$ is the number of leading~1s in the binary representation of $n-1$, and general minimum broadcast graphs are known to have $\Omega(n\cdot L(n))$ edges.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions G, H and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Distance Recoloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For integers $d \geq 1$ and $k \geq d+1$, the \textsc{Distance Coloring} problem asks if a given graph $G$ has a $(d, k)$-coloring, i.e., a coloring of the vertices of $G$ by $k$ colors such that any two vertices within distance $d$ from each other have different colors. In particular, the well-known \textsc{Coloring} problem is a special case of \textsc{Distance Coloring} when $d = 1$. For integers $d \geq 2$ and $k \geq d+1$, the \textsc{$(d, k)$-Coloring Reconfiguration} problem asks if there is a way to change the color of one vertex at a time, starting from a $(d, k)$-coloring $\alpha$ of a graph $G$ to reach another $(d, k)$-coloring $\beta$ of $G$, such that all intermediate colorings are also $(d, k)$-colorings.
  We show that even for planar, bipartite, and $2$-degenerate graphs, \textsc{$(d, k)$-Coloring Reconfiguration} remains $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete for $d \geq 2$ and $k = \Omega(d^2)$ via a reduction from the well-known \textsc{Sliding Tokens} problem. Additionally, on split graphs, there is an interesting dichotomy: the problem is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete when $d = 2$ and $k$ is large but can be solved efficiently when $d \geq 3$ and $k \geq d+1$. For chordal graphs, we show that the problem is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete for even values of $d \geq 2$. Finally, we design a quadratic-time algorithm to solve the problem on paths for any $d \geq 2$ and $k \geq d+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear recurrences we consider here include the functions $3x(1-x)$ and $\cos(x)$, which possess attractive fixed points $2/3$ and $0.739...$ (Dottie's number). Detailed asymptotics for oscillatory convergence are found, starting with a 1960 paper by Wolfgang Thron. Another function, $x/(1+x\ln(1+x))$, gives rise to a sequence with monotonic convergence to $0$ but requires substantial work to calculate its associated constant $C$.</description>
