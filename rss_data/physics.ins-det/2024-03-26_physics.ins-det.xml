      <title>Performance of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation and performance of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) are presented, based on data collected in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the CERN LHC, in the years from 2015 to 2018 (LHC Run 2), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 151 fb$^{-1}$. The CMS ECAL is a scintillating lead-tungstate crystal calorimeter, with a silicon strip preshower detector in the forward region that provides precise measurements of the energy and the time-of-arrival of electrons and photons. The successful operation of the ECAL is crucial for a broad range of physics goals, ranging from observing the Higgs boson and measuring its properties, to other standard model measurements and searches for new phenomena. Precise calibration, alignment, and monitoring of the ECAL response are important ingredients to achieve these goals. To face the challenges posed by the higher luminosity, which characterized the operation of the LHC in Run 2, the procedures established during the 2011-2012 run of the LHC have been revisited and new methods have been developed for the energy measurement and for the ECAL calibration. The energy resolution of the calorimeter, for electrons from Z boson decays reaching the ECAL without significant loss of energy by bremsstrahlung, was better than 1.8%, 3.0%, and 4.5% in the $\lvert\eta\rvert$ intervals [0.0,0.8], [0.8,1.5], [1.5, 2.5], respectively. This resulting performance is similar to that achieved during Run 1 in 2011-2012, in spite of the more severe running conditions.</description>

      <title>CaloPointFlow II Generating Calorimeter Showers as Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of calorimeter showers presents a significant computational challenge, impacting the efficiency and accuracy of particle physics experiments. While generative ML models have been effective in enhancing and accelerating the conventional physics simulation processes, their application has predominantly been constrained to fixed detector readout geometries. With CaloPointFlow we have presented one of the first models that can generate a calorimeter shower as a point cloud. This study describes CaloPointFlow II, which exhibits several significant improvements compared to its predecessor. This includes a novel dequantization technique, referred to as CDF-Dequantization, and a normalizing flow architecture, referred to as DeepSet- Flow. The new model was evaluated with the fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge (CaloChallenge) Dataset II and III.</description>

      <title>Enabling pulse shape discrimination with commercial ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast electronic readout for high-channel density scintillator-based systems is needed for radiation tracking and imaging in a wide range of applications, including nuclear physics, nuclear security and nonproliferation. Programmable electronics, like FPGAs and ASICs, provide a fast way of conditioning and processing the signal in real time. In this paper, we present a pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method based on the shaping circuit of a commercially available ASIC, the Citiroc1A by CAEN Technologies. We used two different shaping times per detector channel to calculate a shaping parameter that enables PSD. Using our new method, neutron and gamma-ray pulses detected by a d$_{12}$-stilbene scintillator can be effectively discriminated at light output values greater than 0.15 MeVee. While not achieving the PSD performance of traditional offline charge integration, our method does not require the transfer of data to a separate system for further processing and enables the direct deployment of high-channel density multi-particle detection systems. Moreover, the availability of a wider range of shaping times than those on the Citiroc1A can potentially further improve the PSD performance.</description>

      <title>Towards a \textbf{RAG}-based Summarization Agent for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity and sheer volume of information encompassing documents, papers, data, and other resources from large-scale experiments demand significant time and effort to navigate, making the task of accessing and utilizing these varied forms of information daunting, particularly for new collaborators and early-career scientists. To tackle this issue, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information; second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain, which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering researchers. As a demonstration, a web application has been developed to explain each stage of the RAG Agent development in detail.</description>

      <title>Radiation Effects on Scientific CMOS Detectors for X-ray Astronomy: II. Total Ionizing Dose Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detectors are a competitive choice for current and upcoming astronomical missions. To understand the performance variations of CMOS detectors in space environment, we investigate the total ionizing dose effects on custom-made large-format X-ray CMOS detectors. Three CMOS detector samples were irradiated with a Co-60 source with a total dose of 70 krad and 105 krad. We test and compare the performance of these detectors before and after irradiation. After irradiation, the dark current increases by roughly 20 to 100 times, and the readout noise increases from 3 e- to 6 e-. The bias level at 50 ms integration time decreases by 13 to 18 Digital Number (DN) at -30 degree. The energy resolution increases from about 150 eV to about 170 eV at 4.5 keV at -30 degree. The conversion gain of the detectors varies for less than 2% after the irradiation. Furthermore, there are about 50 pixels whose bias at 50 ms has changed by more than 20 DN after the exposure to the radiation and about 30 to 140 pixels whose readout noise has increased by over 20 e- at -30 degree at 50 ms integration time. These results demonstrate that the performances of large-format CMOS detectors do not suffer significant degeneration in space environment.</description>

      <title>Searches for CE{\nu}NS and Physics beyond the Standard Model using Skipper-CCDs at CONNIE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coherent Neutrino-Nucleus Interaction Experiment (CONNIE) aims to detect the coherent scattering (CE$\nu$NS) of reactor antineutrinos off silicon nuclei using thick fully-depleted high-resistivity silicon CCDs. Two Skipper-CCD sensors with sub-electron readout noise capability were installed at the experiment next to the Angra-2 reactor in 2021, making CONNIE the first experiment to employ Skipper-CCDs for reactor neutrino detection. We report on the performance of the Skipper-CCDs, the new data processing and data quality selection techniques and the event selection for CE$\nu$NS interactions, which enable CONNIE to reach a record low detection threshold of 15 eV. The data were collected over 300 days in 2021-2022 and correspond to exposures of 14.9 g-days with the reactor-on and 3.5 g-days with the reactor-off. The difference between the reactor-on and off event rates shows no excess and yields upper limits at 95% confidence level for the neutrino interaction rates comparable with previous CONNIE limits from standard CCDs and higher exposures. Searches for new neutrino interactions beyond the Standard Model were performed, yielding an improvement on the previous CONNIE limit on a simplified model with light vector mediators. A first dark matter (DM) search by diurnal modulation was performed by CONNIE and the results represent the best limits on the DM-electron scattering cross-section, obtained by a surface-level experiment. These promising results, obtained using a very small-mass sensor, illustrate the potential of Skipper-CCDs to probe rare neutrino interactions and motivate the plans to increase the detector mass in the near future.</description>

      <title>On machine learning analysis of atomic force microscopy images for image classification, sample surface recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM or SPM) imaging is one of the best matches with machine learning (ML) analysis among microscopy techniques. The digital format of AFM images allows for direct utilization in ML algorithms without the need for additional processing. Additionally, AFM enables the simultaneous imaging of distributions of over a dozen different physicochemical properties of sample surfaces, a process known as multidimensional imaging. While this wealth of information can be challenging to analyze using traditional methods, ML provides a seamless approach to this task. However, the relatively slow speed of AFM imaging poses a challenge in applying deep learning methods broadly used in image recognition. This Prospective is focused on ML recognition/classification when using a relatively small number of AFM images, small database. We discuss ML methods other than popular deep-learning neural networks. The described approach has already been successfully used to analyze and classify the surfaces of biological cells. It can be applied to recognize medical images, specific material processing, in forensic studies, even to identify the authenticity of arts. A general template for ML analysis specific to AFM is suggested, with a specific example of the identification of cell phenotype. Special attention is given to the analysis of the statistical significance of the obtained results, an important feature that is often overlooked in papers dealing with machine learning. A simple method for finding statistical significance is also described.</description>

      <title>Wide-Spectral-Band Nuller Insensitive to Finite Stellar Angular Diameter with a One-Dimensional Diffraction-Limited Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potentially habitable planets around nearby stars less massive than solar-type stars could join targets of the spectroscopy of the planetary reflected light with future space telescopes. However, the orbits of most of these planets occur near the diffraction limit for 6-m-diameter telescopes. Thus, while securing contrast-mitigation ability under a broad spectral bandwidth and a finite stellar angular diameter, we must maintain planetary throughput even at the diffraction-limited angles to be able to reduce the effect of the photon noise within a reasonable observation time. A one-dimensional diffraction-limited coronagraph (1DDLC) observes planets near the diffraction limit with undistorted point spread functions but has a finite-stellar diameter problem in wideband use. This study presents a method for wide-spectral-band nulling insensitive to stellar-angular-diameter by adding a fiber nulling with a Lyot-plane phase mask to the 1DDLC. Designing the pattern of the Lyot-plane mask function focuses on the parity of the amplitude spread function of light. Our numerical simulation shows that the planetary throughput (including the fiber-coupling efficiency) can reach about 11% for about 1.35-$\lambda/D$ planetary separation almost independently of the spectral bandwidth. The simulation also shows the raw contrast of about $4\times10^{-8}$ (the spectral bandwidth of 25%) and $5\times10^{-10}$ (the spectral bandwidth of 10%) for $3\times 10^{-2}$ $\lambda/D$ stellar angular diameter. The planetary throughput depends on the planetary azimuthal angle, which may degrade the exploration efficiency compared to an isotropic throughput but is partially offset by the wide spectral band.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutrino Oscillations with Reactor Antineutrinos in JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment currently under construction in South China, in an underground laboratory with approximately 650 m of rock overburden (1800 m.w.e.). The detector consists of a 20 kton liquid scintillator target, contained inside a 35.4-meter-diameter spherical acrylic vessel. The central detector (CD) is equipped with 17,612 20-inch and 25,600 3-inch Photomultipliers Tubes (PMTs), providing more than 75% total photocathode coverage. JUNO's main goal is the determination of the neutrino mass ordering with reactor antineutrinos, emitted from two adjacent nuclear power plants on a ~52.5 km baseline from the experimental site. JUNO's strategic location at a baseline corresponding to the first solar oscillation maximum, where the kinematic phase $\Delta_{21} \simeq \frac{\pi}{2}$, grants it the unique capability to simultaneously probe the effects of oscillations on both solar and atmospheric scales; moreover, it stands out as the first experiment to address the unresolved NMO question through vacuum-dominant oscillations. The oscillated energy spectrum in JUNO changes subtly depending on the neutrino mass ordering, which manifests as an energy-dependent phase shift, thus providing sensitivity to this parameter. Furthermore, the unparalleled size and energy resolution will enable to achieve a sub-percent precision on three parameters: $\Delta m_{21}^{2}$, $\Delta m_{31}^{2}$, and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. This contribution will focus on JUNO's oscillation physics potential with reactor antineutrinos, with a particular emphasis on its crucial role in inaugurating a new era of precision within the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>Discharge quenching mechanism and performance of RPWELL with tunable 3D printed resistive plates, charge evacuation in semiconductive glass RPWELL and discharge quenching for Cryogenic-RWELL over a wide range of resistivity</title>

Abstract: Resistive electrodes are used in gaseous detectors to quench electrical discharges. This helps to protect delicate electrodes and readout electronics and to improve the stability of the detector operation. An RPWELL is a THGEM-based WELL detector with a resistive plate coupled to a conductive anode. Till now, the choice of the resistive plate was limited to a few materials, like LRS Glass and Semitron. These materials have fixed resistivities and, sometimes, thickness and area limitations. This restricts the potential usage of the detector to a rather small range of applications, as well as the possibility of studying in depth the physics processes governing the discharge quenching mechanism. In our present study, we used a new plastic material doped with carbon nanotubes to produce resistive plates with a commercial 3D printer. This method has the flexibility to produce samples of different thicknesses and different resistivity values. We describe here the sample production and characterize the RPWELL performance with different resistive plates. In particular we show the dependence of discharge quenching on the thickness and resistivity of the plate. The dynamics of the charge carriers in the material is proposed as an explanation for the long gain recovery time after a discharge.</description>

Abstract: Time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) allows direct mapping of the electronic band structure and its dynamic response on femtosecond timescales. Here, we present a new ARPES system, powered by a new fiber-based femtosecond light source in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range, accessing the complete first Brillouin zone for most materials. We present trARPES data on Au(111), polycrystalline Au, Bi2Se3 and TaTe2, demonstrating an energy resolution of 21 meV with a time resolution of &lt;360 fs, at a high repetition rate of 1 MHz. The system is integrated with an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) high harmonic generation (HHG) beamline, enabling excellent tunability of the time-bandwidth resolution.</description>

      <title>A proposed PKU-Muon experiment for muon tomography and dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose here a set of new methods to directly detect light mass dark matter through its scattering with abundant atmospheric muons or accelerator beams. Firstly, we plan to use the free cosmic-ray muons interacting with dark matter in a volume surrounded by tracking detectors, to trace possible interaction between dark matter and muons. Secondly, we will interface our device with domestic or international muon beams. Due to much larger muon intensity and focused beam, we anticipate the detector can be made further compact and the resulting sensitivity on dark matter searches will be improved. Furthermore, we will measure precisely directional distributions of cosmic-ray muons, either at mountain or sea level, and the differences may reveal possible information of dark matter distributed near the earth. Specifically, our methods can have advantages over `exotic' dark matters which are either muon-philic or slowed down due to some mechanism, and sensitivity on dark matter and muon scattering cross section can reach as low as microbarn level.</description>
