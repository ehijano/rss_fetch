      <title>Transcendence Meets Normality: Construction of Transcendentally Normal Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study real numbers $x$ for which $p(x)$ is (absolutely) normal for every non-constant integer-valued polynomial $p$. We call such numbers transcendentally normal. We prove that almost every real number is transcendentally normal and provide an explicit construction of such a number, based on Sierpinski's covering method and novel ideas involving the so-called stretch function. In the next step, we transform this construction into an algorithm that computes the digits of a t-normal number recursively in all integer bases. Moreover, we extend our covering approach to construct and compute LIL-normal numbers whose discrepancies are of the order predicted by the law of the iterated logarithm. We also take the opportunity to discuss several interesting open problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport on Lie Group Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In its most general form, the optimal transport problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, yet certain notable instances admit closed-form solutions. We identify the common source of this tractability as symmetry and formalize it using Lie group theory. Fixing a Lie group action on the outcome space and a reference distribution, we study optimal transport between measures lying on the same Lie group orbit of the reference distribution. In this setting, the Monge problem admits an explicit upper bound given by an optimization over the stabilizer subgroup of the reference distribution. The reduced problem's dimension scales with that of the stabilizing subgroup and, in the tractable cases we study, is either zero or finite. Under mild regularity conditions, a simple algebraic certificate, verified at an optimizer of the reduced problem, ensures tightness of the upper bound for both the Monge and Kantorovich formulations, with the optimal map realized by a single group element. This orbit-based viewpoint unifies known closed-form solutions, such as those for one-dimensional and elliptical distributions, and yields a new one for optimal transport between Wishart distributions.</description>

      <title>Parallel repetition of expanded, and multiplayer, Quantum games: anchoring, optimal values, generalized error bounds, dependency-breaking as symmetry-breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that parallel repetition of the multiplayer anchored optimal value, $\omega \big( G_{\bot} \big)^{\otimes n}$, decays exponentially. Central to our approach are several probabilistic computations, pertaining to: (1) the computation of expected values for quantifying how the winning probability of the game is likely to change under the anchoring transformation; (2) the computation of positive operator valued measurements, which can be placed into direct correspondence with several probabilistically defined quantities; (3) the computation of Relative, and Relative-min entropies; (4) and lastly, the computation of generalized error bounds, which have previously been analyzed by the author in several multiplayer game-theoretic settings (arXiv: 2505.06322, and arXiv: 2507.03035). This work builds upon observations originally provided by Bavarian, Vidick, and Yuen (arXiv: 1509.07466).</description>

      <title>Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for affine stochastic functional differential equations and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence and global stability of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for affine stochastic functional differential equations. Various very basic and important properties are established. In the applications, we present a standard and rigorous procedure for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of random equilibria for nonlinear stochastic functional differential equations, which attracts all pull-back trajectories in different types of convergence. Some examples are given to illustrate our main results. The results presented in this paper improve and simplify the conclusions of Jiang and Lv [{\it SIAM J. Control Optim.}, 54 (2016), pp. 2383-2402] and [{\it J. Differential Equations}, 367 (2023), pp. 890-921].</description>

      <title>Isochronal Phase Reduction and Speed Correction of a Pulse in a Stochastic Kinematic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for computing the stochastic wave speed of pulse solutions in kinematic equations subject to small stochastic forcing based on the isochronal phase reduction. These kinematic equations arise as the singular limit of sharp pulse solutions in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, and our approach contributes a new perspective and method to the growing body of work on stochastic wave propagation in excitable media. The method yields an effective It\^o process for the wave's position. The coefficients of the It\^o process can be computed deterministically allowing for efficient computation. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method through numerical demonstrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the divergence of Kleinian groups $\Gamma$ and the recurrence of simple random walks on the Schreier graph associated with $\Gamma$. In particular, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of a lattice and is of divergence type, then the Schreier graph is recurrent. Our approach builds connections among the growth rate of the $\Gamma$-orbit, the volume growth rate of the quotient manifolds, and the growth rate of the Schreier graph. Using the connections, we construct abundant Kleinian groups of divergence type.</description>

      <title>Joint Moments of Characteristic Polynomials from the Orthogonal and Unitary Symplectic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish asymptotic formulae for general joint moments of characteristic polynomials and their higher-order derivatives associated with matrices drawn randomly from the groups $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ in the limit as $N\to\infty$. This relates the leading-order asymptotic contribution in each case to averages over the Laguerre ensemble of random matrices. We uncover an exact connection between these joint moments and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'{e} V equation, valid for finite matrix size, as well as a connection between the leading-order asymptotic term and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'{e} III$'$ equation in the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$. These connections enable us to derive exact formulae for joint moments for finite matrix size and for the joint moments of certain random variables arising from the Bessel point process in a recursive way. As an application, we provide a positive answer to a question proposed by Altu\u{g} et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of probability measures in terms of moments by applying operators to their Bessel generating functions. We consider a general setting of applying operators such as the Dunkl operator to formal power series that are symmetric or symmetric in all but one variable. Afterwards, we apply the results from this setting by considering Bessel generating functions as the formal power series to obtain a Law of Large Numbers as $N$, the number of variables, increases to infinity and $N^c\beta$ converges to a constant, where $c\in (-\infty, 1)$. In contrast with previous results, we consider when the scaled partial derivatives of the logarithms of the Bessel generating functions evaluated at the origin can have nonzero $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit when any number of variables is involved. Then, the free cumulant of order $k$ is a linear combination of the limits of the order $k$ partial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Red noise in continuous-time stochastic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of time-correlated noise is important to applied stochastic modelling. Nevertheless, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of the term red noise in continuous-time stochastic modelling settings. We present here a rigorous argumentation for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process integrated against time ($U_t \mathrm{d} t$) as a uniquely appropriate red noise implementation. We also identify the term $\mathrm{d}U_t$ as an erroneous formulation of red noise commonly found in the applied literature. To this end, we prove a theorem linking properties of the power spectral density (PSD) to classes of It\^{o}-differentials. The commonly ascribed red noise attribute of a PSD decaying as $S(\omega)\sim\omega^{-2}$ restricts the range of possible It\^{o}-differentials $\mathrm{d}Y_t=\alpha_t\mathrm{d} t+\beta_t\mathrm{d} W_t$. In particular, any such differential with continuous, square-integrable integrands must have a vanishing martingale part, i.e. $\mathrm{d}Y_t=\alpha_t\mathrm{d} t$ for almost all $t\geq 0$. We further point out that taking $(\alpha_t)_{t\geq 0}$ to be an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process constitutes a uniquely relevant model choice due to its Gauss-Markov property. The erroneous use of the noise term $\mathrm{d} U_t$ as red noise and its consequences are discussed in two examples from the literature.</description>

      <title>Reaction cleaving and complex-balanced distributions for chemical reaction networks with general kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04091v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction networks have become a major modelling framework in the biological sciences from epidemiology and population biology to genetics and cellular biology. In recent years, much progress has been made on stochastic reaction networks (SRNs), modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their stationary distributions. We are interested in complex-balanced stationary distributions, where the probability flow out of a complex equals the flow into the complex. We characterise the existence and the form of complex-balanced distributions of SRNs with arbitrary transition functions through conditions on the cycles of the reaction graph (a digraph). Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a complex-balanced distribution and give precise conditions for when it is also necessary. The sufficient condition is also necessary for mass-action kinetics (and certain generalisations of that) or if the connected components of the digraph are cycles. Moreover, we state a deficiency theorem, a generalisation of the deficiency theorem for stochastic mass-action kinetics to arbitrary stochastic kinetics. The theorem gives the co-dimension of the parameter space for which a complex-balanced distribution exists. To achieve this, we construct an iterative procedure to decompose a strongly connected reaction graph into disjoint cycles, such that the corresponding SRN has equivalent dynamics and preserves complex-balancedness, provided the original SRN had so. This decomposition might have independent interest and might be applicable to edge-labelled digraphs in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under typical scaling, the last passage time field of the directed last passage percolation model with exponential site distributions converges to the KPZ fixed point. In this paper, we consider an atypical scenario in which the last passage time to a specific site is unusually large, and we explore how the last passage time field changes under this one-point upper large deviation event. We prove a conditional law of large numbers and compute the limiting fluctuations in certain regimes. Our proofs rely on an analysis of explicit multi-point distributions.</description>

      <title>Importance Corrected Neural JKO Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be an acylindrically hyperbolic group. We prove that Bernoulli bond percolation on every Cayley graph of $G$ has a nonuniqueness phase, in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters. This generalizes Hutchcroft's result for Gromov hyperbolic graphs to relatively hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups and rank-1 CAT(0) groups for example.</description>
