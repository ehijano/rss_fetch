      <title>Forbidden Emission Line spectro-imaging of the RU Lupi jet and Low Velocity Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first images of the jet and low velocity component (LVC) from the strongly accreting classical T Tauri star RU Lupi are presented. Adaptive optics assisted spectro-imaging of forbidden emission lines was used. The main aim of the observations was to test the conclusion from a recent spectro-astrometric study that the narrow component of the LVC is tracing an MHD disk wind, and to estimate the mass loss rate in the wind. The structure and morphology of the component supports a wind origin for the NC. An upper limit to the launch radius and semi-opening angle of the wind in [O I]{\lambda}6300 emission are estimated to be 2 au and 19{\deg} in agreement with MHD wind models for high accretors. The height of the [O I]{\lambda}6300 wind emitting region, a key parameter for the derivation of the mass loss rate, is estimated for the first time at approximately 35 au giving M_out = 2.6 x 10^-11 M_sun/yr. When compared to the derived mass accretion rate of M_acc = 1.6 x 10^-7 M_sun/yr, the efficiency in the wind is too low for the wind to be significantly contributing to angular momentum removal.</description>

      <title>Novel scaling laws to derive spatially resolved flare and CME parameters from sun-as-a-star observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are often associated with X-ray (SXR) flares powered by magnetic reconnection in the low-corona, while the CME shocks in the upper corona and interplanetary (IP) space accelerate electrons often producing the type-II radio bursts. The CME and the reconnection event are part of the same energy release process as highlighted by the correlation between reconnection flux ($\phi_{rec}$) that quantifies the strength of the released magnetic free energy during SXR flare, and the CME kinetic energy that drives the IP shocks leading to type-II bursts. Unlike the sun, these physical parameters cannot be directly inferred in stellar observations. Hence, scaling laws between unresolved sun-as-a-star observables, namely SXR luminosity ($L_X$) and type-II luminosity ($L_R$), and the physical properties of the associated dynamical events are crucial. Such scaling laws also provide insights into the interconnections between the particle acceleration processes across low-corona to IP space during solar-stellar 'flare- CME- type-II' events. Using long-term solar data in SXR to radio waveband, we derive a scaling law between two novel power metrics for the flare and CME-associated processes. The metrics of 'flare power' ($P_{flare}=\sqrt{L_X\phi_{rec}}$) and 'CME power' ($P_{CME}= \sqrt{L_R {V_{CME}}^2}$), where $V_{CME}$ is the CME speed, scale as $P_{flare}\propto P_{CME}^{0.76 \pm 0.04}$. Besides, $L_X$ and $\phi_{rec}$ show power-law trends with $P_{CME}$ with indices of 1.12$\pm$0.05 and 0.61$\pm$0.05 respectively. These power-laws help infer the spatially resolved physical parameters, $V_{CME}$ and $\phi_{rec}$, from disk-averaged observables, $L_X$ and $L_R$ during solar-stellar 'flare- CME- type-II' events.</description>

      <title>Physical Parameters and Properties of 20 Cold Brown Dwarfs in JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of 20 T and Y dwarfs using spectroscopy from the NIRSpec CLEAR/PRISM and MIRI LRS instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. To characterize the atmospheric parameters, we utilize two atmospheric model grids: the Sonora Elf Owl and ATMO2020++. The effective temperatures derived from the two models are relatively consistent, and metallicities are both close to solar values. However, significant discrepancies are found in other parameters, particularly in surface gravity, with the values obtained from the Sonora Elf Owl models typically being about 1 dex lower than those from the ATMO2020++ models. Further comparisons using the ATMO2020 models highlight that the adiabatic convective process introduced in the ATMO2020++ models has a significant impact on the determination of surface gravity. Using the fitted effective temperatures and absolute parallaxes from the literature, we derive radii for the brown dwarfs, which range from approximately 0.8 to 1.2 $R_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. The estimated masses and ages, derived using evolutionary tracks, indicate that most brown dwarfs in our sample have masses below 30 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and are younger than 6 Gyr. Specifically, Y dwarfs have masses ranging from 2 to 20 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and ages between 0.1 and 6.7 Gyr. In addition, We discuss the determination of atmospheric parameters using only NIRSpec or MIRI spectra. Comparisons with results from the combined spectra show that the effective temperatures and surface gravities derived solely from NIRSpec spectra are largely consistent with those obtained from the combined spectra.</description>

      <title>Quadratic frequency dispersion in the oscillations of intermediate-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology, the study of stellar vibration, has met with great success, shedding light on stellar interior structure, rotation, and magnetism. Prominently known as $\delta$ Scutis, intermediate-mass main-sequence oscillators that often exhibit rapid rotation and possess complex internal stratification, are important targets of asteroseismic study. $\delta$ Scuti pulsations are driven by the $\kappa$ (opacity) mechanism, resulting in a set of acoustic modes that can be challenging to interpret. Here, we apply machine learning to identify new patterns in the pulsation frequencies of $\delta$ Scuti stars, discovering resonances spaced according to quadratic functions of integer mode indices. This unusual connection between mode frequencies and indices suggests that rotational influence may play an important role in determining the frequencies of these acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field of the roAp star KIC~10685175: observations versus theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KIC 10685175 is a roAp star whose polar magnetic field is predicted to be 6 kG through a non-adiabatic axisymmetric pulsation theoretical model. In this work, we aim to measure the magnetic field strength of KIC 10685175 using high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations, and compare it with the one predicted by the theoretical model. From the study of two high-resolution unpolarized spectra, we obtained [$T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], $V_{mic}$]=[8250 $\pm$ 200\,K, 4.4 $\pm$ 0.1, -0.4 $\pm$ 0.2, 0.16 $\pm$ 0.1, 1.73 $\pm$ 0.2\,km~s$^{-1}$]. Although the Fe absorption lines appear relatively weak in comparison to typical Ap stars with similar $T_{\rm eff}$, the lines belonging to rare earth elements (Eu and Nd) are stronger than that in chemically normal stars, indicating the peculiar nature of KIC~10685175. The mean longitudinal magnetic field $\langle B_\ell \rangle=-226\pm39$\,G has been measured in the polarized spectrum, but magnetically split lines were not detected. No significant line profile variability was evident in our spectra. Also the longitudinal magnetic field strengths measured using line masks constructed for different elements have been rather similar. Due to a poor rotation phase coverage of our data, additional spectroscopic and polarimetric observations are needed to allow us to conclude on the inhomogeneous element distribution over the stellar surface. The estimated polar magnetic field is $4.8 \pm 0.8$\,kG, which is consistent with the predicted polar magnetic field strength of about 6\,kG within 3$\sigma$. This work therefore provides support for the pulsation theoretical model.</description>

      <title>The impact of third dredge-up on the mass loss of Mira variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The details of the mass-loss process in the late stages of low- and intermediate-mass stellar evolution are not well understood, in particular its dependence on stellar parameters. Mira variables are highly suitable targets for studying this mass-loss process. Aims: We follow up on our earlier finding that a near-to-mid-infrared colour vs. pulsation period diagram shows two sequences of Miras that can be distinguished by the third dredge-up (3DUP) indicator technetium in those stars. While IR colours are good indicators of the dust mass-loss rate (MLR) from Miras, no corresponding sequences have been found using the gas MLR. However, investigations of the gas MLR have been hampered by data limitations. We aim to alleviate these limitations with new observational data. Methods: We present new optical spectra of a well-selected sample of Miras. We searched these spectra for absorption lines of Tc and other 3DUP indicators and combined our findings with gas MLRs and expansion velocities from the literature. Furthermore, we analyse WISE MIR data and compare the broadband SEDs of Miras with and without Tc. Results: We find no systematic difference in gas MLRs between Miras with and without Tc. However, the gas envelopes of Tc-poor Miras appear to have a higher expansion velocity than those of Miras with Tc. Furthermore, our analysis of the IR photometry strongly corroborates the earlier finding that Tc-poor Miras have a higher MIR emission than Tc-rich ones, by as much as a factor of two. We model the IR colours with DARWIN and stationary wind models and conclude that Miras with and without Tc have different dust content or properties. Conclusions: We discuss several hypotheses of the observations and conclude that the reduction of free oxygen by 3DUP of carbon and iron-depleted dust grains in Tc-rich stars are the most convincing explanations for our observations.</description>

      <title>On the simultaneity of Forbush decreases: the simultaneous effects of interplanetary parameters and geomagnetic activity indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forbush decreases (Fd) are transient, short-term reductions in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth's surface. When this reduction is observed at multiple locations at the same time, it is referred to as simultaneous Forbush decreases (SFd). Identifying Fd events in daily averaged Cosmic ray (CR) raw data is always tedious, but the task has gone minimal through an algorithm (automated Fd detection). We deployed an automated Fd location algorithm on daily-averaged CR data from five neutron monitor stations covering the period 1998 to 2006. We identified 80 days with the most simultaneous events. While there exists extensive research on the subject using a case study approach, the current study is statistical. Whereas most of the previous investigations employed a small sample of Fds manually selected from a single CR station, large samples of Fds, selected after disentangling the Sun's influence on CR data from multiple neutron monitors (MNs) are used. The connection between the Fds and many solar-terrestrial variables is tested. The beautiful and consistent results obtained between the space weather variables and Fds at the five NM stations call the attention of space weather researchers to the need for rigorous, detailed, and accurate cataloging of Fds. Solar cycle oscillation significantly impacts the amplitude and timing of Fds. Its influence should be removed before Fd selection.</description>

      <title>Study of Evolution and Geo-effectiveness of CME-CME Interactions using MHD Simulations with SWASTi framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geo-effectiveness of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is a critical area of study in space weather, particularly in the lesser-explored domain of CME-CME interactions and their geomagnetic consequences. This study leverages the SWASTi framework to perform 3D MHD simulation of a range of CME-CME interaction scenarios within realistic solar wind conditions. The focus is on the dynamics of the initial magnetic flux, speed, density, and tilt of CMEs, and their individual and combined impacts on the disturbance storm time (Dst) index. Additionally, the kinematic, magnetic, and structural impacts on the leading CME, as well as the mixing of both CMEs, are analyzed. Time series in-situ studies are conducted through virtual spacecraft positioned along three different longitudes at 1 AU. Our findings reveal that CME-CME interactions are non-uniform along different longitudes due to the inhomogeneous ambient solar wind conditions. A significant increase in the momentum and kinetic energy of the leading CME is observed due to collisions with the trailing CME, along with the formation of reverse shocks in cases of strong interaction. These reverse shocks lead to complex wave patterns inside CME2, which can prolong the storm recovery phase. Furthermore, we observed that the minimum Dst value decreases with an increase in the initial density, tilt, and speed of the trailing CME.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of detached eclipsing binaries during total eclipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) with total eclipses, for which UVES spectra were obtained during the phase of totality. With the additional, independent information on effective temperature and metallicity of one of the components, we aimed at estimating the precise ages of the studied binaries, and show the usefulness of totality spectra. We also provide precise orbital and physical stellar parameters of the components of systems in question. Using the VLT/UVES we obtained high-resolution spectra of 11 DEBs during their total eclipse phase. Atmospheric parameters of then-visible (larger) components were obtained with iSpec. With additional spectroscopy from the CR\'EME project, public archives, and literature, we obtained radial velocity (RV) measurements, from which orbital parameters were calculated. Photometric time-series observations from TESS and ASAS were modelled with the JKTEBOP code, and, combined with RV-based results, allowed us to obtain physical parameters for nine double-lined systems from our sample. All the available data were used to constrain the ages with our own approach, utilising MESA isochrones. Reddening-free, isochrone-based distances were also estimated, and confronted with Gaia DR3. We show that single spectroscopic observations taken during a total eclipse can break the age-metallicity degeneracy, and allow for precise determination of the age of a DEB, down to 5-10% level of uncertainty. Even for single-lined DEBs, where absolute masses are not possible to obtain, the spectroscopic analysis of one of the components allows one to put strong constraints on the properties of both stars. For some cases we noted inconsistencies between isochrone-based and GDR3 distances. For one binary, which could not be fitted with a single isochrone (RZ Eri) we suggest a new explanation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic connectivity from the Sun to the Earth with MHD models I. Impact of the magnetic modelling for connectivity validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the magnetic connectivity between the Sun and the Earth, which is essential for understanding solar wind and space weather events. Due to limited direct observations, reliable simulations are necessary. The most commonly used method is the two-step ballistic method, but it has many free parameters that affect the results. The authors propose a method based on self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. They combine the COCONUT coronal model with the EUHFORIA heliospheric model to compute magnetic field lines from the Earth to the Sun and quantify spatial and temporal uncertainties. To validate their method, they analyze four events associated with high-speed streams from well-identified coronal holes. The results show partial overlap with the assumed coronal holes of origin, ranging from 19% to 100% depending on the event. They also examine the magnetic polarity observed on Earth, finding that MHD simulations provide a good polarity estimation, with agreement ranging from 36% to 69% across the events. Spatial and temporal uncertainties explain the mixed results for some cases. MHD models appear more effective during periods of maximum solar activity due to the latitudinal extent of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The authors conclude that MHD models offer results as good as the two-step ballistic method, with potential for improvement as more critical physics are integrated into the models.</description>

      <title>The Dustiest Galactic S Stars: Mid-Infrared Spectra from SOFIA/FORCAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectra of 12 of the reddest, and hence dustiest, S stars in the Milky Way, observed with the FORCAST grisms on SOFIA. S stars are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with C/O$\sim$1, so their molecular and dust chemistries are dominated by neither O nor C, often leading to atypical spectral features from their molecules and dust grains. All of the stars in our sample have strong dust emission features at 10--11 $\mu$m, but the shape of the feature in most of the stars differs from the shapes commonly observed in either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich AGB stars. Two stars also show the 13 $\mu$m feature associated with crystalline alumina. Two have a water absorption band at $\sim$6.5--7.5 $\mu$m, and a third has a tentative detection, but only one of these three has the more common SiO absorption band at 7.5 $\mu$m. Three others show a red 6.3 $\mu$m emission feature from complex hydrocarbons consistent with ``Class C'' objects, and in a fourth it appears at 6.37 $\mu$m, redder than even the standard Class C hydrocarbon feature. Class C spectra typically indicate complex hydrocarbons which have been less processed by UV radiation, resulting in more aliphatic bonds relative to aromatic bonds. None of the S stars shows a strong 11.3 $\mu$m hydrocarbon feature, which is also consistent with the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Residual Energy and Broken Symmetry in Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic interactions which transfer energy from large to small spatial scales lie at the heart of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. An important feature of the turbulence is the generation of negative residual energy -- excess energy in magnetic fluctuations compared to velocity fluctuations. By contrast, an MHD Alfv\'en wave has equal amounts of energy in fluctuations of each type. Alfv\'enic quasimodes that do not satisfy the Alfv\'en wave dispersion relation and exist only in the presence of a nonlinear term can contain either positive or negative residual energy, but until now an intuitive physical explanation for why negative residual energy is preferred has remained elusive. This paper shows that the equations of reduced MHD are symmetric in that they have no intrinsic preference for one sign of the residual energy over the other. An initial state that is not an exact solution to the equations can break this symmetry in a way that leads to net-negative residual energy generation. Such a state leads to a solution with three distinct parts: nonresonant Alfv\'enic quasimodes, normal modes produced to satisfy initial conditions, and resonant normal modes that grow in time. The latter two parts strongly depend on initial conditions; the resulting symmetry breaking leads to net-negative residual energy both in Alfv\'enic quasimodes and $\omega=k_\parallel{V_A}=0$ modes. These modes have net-positive residual energy in the equivalent boundary value problem, suggesting that the initial value setup is a better match for solar wind turbulence.</description>

      <title>Measuring Coherent Radio and Microwave Photons from the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rates of production of radio/microwave N-identical photons states |N&gt; from stimulated emission in the solar atmosphere are estimated. Effects of various decohering factors are shown to be small. Ground based measurements of these quantum states via the inverse HOM effect are proposed. We argue that a signal is detectable and far above the noise in several cases.</description>

      <title>Statistical view of orbital circularisation with 14 000 characterised TESS eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binaries are crucial for understanding stellar physics, allowing detailed studies of stellar masses, radii, and orbital dynamics. Recent space missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) have significantly expanded the catalogue of observed eclipsing binaries with uninterrupted time series photometry, providing an opportunity for large-scale ensemble studies. This study aims to analyse the statistical properties of circularisation in a large sample of intermediate-to-high mass eclipsing binaries observed by TESS. We explore the dependence of orbital circularisation on stellar properties and orbital parameters to improve our understanding of the physical processes affecting these systems. We further aim to assess the role of stellar pulsations in circularisation. We compiled a catalogue of O- to F-type stars to search for eclipsing binary signals in the TESS data. Using automated classification and data analysis methodologies, we arrive at a well-characterised sample of 14,573 eclipsing binaries. We investigate the statistical characteristics of the sample as a function of temperature, orbital period, and scaled orbital separation. The orbital circularisation was measured with statistical methods to obtain three distinct measurements of the critical period and separation in four temperature ranges. Pulsations were identified in the g- and p-mode regimes and a reduced fraction of eccentric systems was found among them. Our analysis confirmed and expanded upon previous findings that additional dissipation is needed as compared to the predictions of turbulent viscosity and non-resonant radiative damping. We speculate that pulsations may play a role in the circularisation of close binaries. Our study highlights the need for dissipative mechanisms that can produce a wide range of critical periods from a range of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The origin of free-floating objects in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky way Galaxy is brimming with free-floating objects, including stars, planets and planetesimals. For the purpose of this chapter, we define a free-floating object as a solid body that is not orbited by a considerably more massive body. A planet then is considered free floating if it is not orbiting a star but it may be orbiting another planet. A binary planet, or planet-moon pair that is not orbiting a star, is then considered free floating.
  Most free-floating objects are not born as such because most objects form in some sort of coordinated environmental effort, such as a star forming region or a circum-stellar disk. Free-floating stars then originate from dissolved clusters. Free floating planets are ejected from their parent star in an internal dynamical encounter with another planet or stripped from the star by other means such as a supernova or a nearby passing star. Free floating (interstellar) planetesimals probably form in a similar fashion as free-floating planets.
  The number of free-floating objects in the Galaxy can be large. With billions of stars and planets, and trillions of interstellar planetesimals. Although free-floating planets appear to be quite common (a few hundred have been observed), only two interstellar planetesimals have been discovered so far. The expectation, however, is that they outnumber the stars in the Galaxy by a considerable margin. We expect them to be found more frequently once large new instruments come online, such as the Vera Cooper Rubin Observatory.</description>

Abstract: We present HZ_evolution, a Python package to characterize the habitable histories of exoplanets. Given inputs of a planet's current effective flux and host star properties, HZ_evolution calculates its instellation history, the evolution of the star's Habitable Zone, and the duration the planet spends inside or outside the Habitable Zone.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions $-$ XVII. High-mass star-formation through a large-scale collapse in IRAS 15394$-$5358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hub-filament systems are considered as natural sites for high-mass star formation. Kinematic analysis of the surroundings of hub-filaments is essential to better understand high-mass star formation within such systems. In this work, we present a detailed study of the massive Galactic protocluster IRAS 15394$-$5358, using continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey. The 3~mm dust continuum map reveals the fragmentation of the massive ($\rm M=843~M_{\odot}$) clump into six cores. The core C-1A is the largest (radius = 0.04~pc), the most massive ($\rm M=157~M_{\odot}$), and lies within the dense central region, along with two smaller cores ($\rm M=7~and~3~M_{\odot}$). The fragmentation process is consistent with the thermal Jeans fragmentation mechanism and virial analysis shows that all the cores have small virial parameter values ($\rm \alpha_{vir}&lt;&lt;2$), suggesting that the cores are gravitationally bound. The mass vs. radius relation indicates that three cores can potentially form at least a single massive star. The integrated intensity map of $\rm H^{13}CO^{+}$ shows that the massive clump is associated with a hub-filament system, where the central hub is linked with four filaments. A sharp velocity gradient is observed towards the hub, suggesting a global collapse where the filaments are actively feeding the hub. We discuss the role of global collapse and the possible driving mechanisms for the massive star formation activity in the protocluster.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LIX. High-temperature line list for N$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New hot line lists for five isotopologues of N$_2$O are presented, for the parent $^{14}$N$_2^{16}$O and 4 singly substituted species $^{14}$N$_2^{17}$O, $^{14}$N$_2^{18}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$N$^{16}$O and $^{15}$N$^{14}$N$^{16}$O. The line lists have been computed with the variational program TROVE using a new empirical potential energy surface (PES) and an accurate ab initio dipole moment surface of N$_2$O Ames-1. The PES was obtained by fitting to experimentally derived energies of N$_2$O compiled using the well established MARVEL procedure. Here we also introduce an `artificial symmetry group' $C_{\rm ns}$(AEM) for an efficient construction of rotation-vibrational basis set of a linear non-symmetric triatomic molecule of the XYZ type. The line lists cover the rotational excitations up to $J=160$ and the wavenumber range up to 20000 cm$^{-1}$. MARVEL energies are also used to improve predicted line positions resulting in excellent agreement with the available experimental spectra, as demonstrated. An extensive comparison with existing line lists for N$_2$O HITRAN, HITEMP, NOSL-296, NOSD-1000 and Ames-296K is provided. The line lists are freely accessible from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Diffuse Interstellar Bands at 5780, 5797 and 6614 {\AA} in Low-Resolution Spectra of Cool Stars from LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in over two million low-resolution spectra of cool stars from LAMOST. Based on the DIB measurements, the correlation between DIBs and extinction, the kinematics of DIBs, and the Galactic distribution of DIBs are reviewed and investigated from the perspective of statistics. A pipeline is developed to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in the LAMOST low-resolution spectra. We obtain the DIB measurements of spectra of late-type stars from LAMOST, and screen out 176,831, 13,473 and 110,152 high-quality (HQ) measurements of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614, respectively, corresponding to 142,074, 11,480 and 85,301 unique sources. Utilizing these HQ measurements, we present the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern sky for the first time. The central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in air are determined to be 5780.48 $\pm$ 0.01, 5796.94 $\pm$ 0.02 and 6613.64 $\pm$ 0.01 {\AA}, respectively, based on their kinematics. The equivalent widths of these three DIBs per unit extinction are statistically fitted to be 0.565, 0.176 and 0.256 {\AA}/mag. As a part of our work, three catalogs of the HQ measurements for the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are provided online. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of measurements of these three DIBs to date. It is also the first time that the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern hemisphere are presented, and the central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are estimated from the kinematics.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of hydromagnetic turbulence with higher order fluid moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Chandrasekhar's deductive theory of turbulence is extended to the case of hydrodynamics and hydromagnetics, with higher order fluid moments. We include the contributions from correlation tensors at two different points of space and two different points in time to account for the energy transfer between Fourier modes with different $k$ values. We start with three governing equations using the first three moments of Vlasov equation, which gives us particle, momentum and energy conservation relations, respectively. We obtain the scalar representations of correlation tensors for hydrodynamics as well as hydromagnetics. Finally we pick an example from literature where the energy spectra alone was not capable of explaining the observations reported by the authors.</description>

Abstract: The stars of the Milky Way carry the chemical history of our Galaxy in their atmospheres as they journey through its vast expanse. Like barcodes, we can extract the chemical fingerprints of stars from high-resolution spectroscopy. The fourth data release (DR4) of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey, based on a decade of observations, provides the chemical abundances of up to 32 elements for 917 588 stars that also have exquisite astrometric data from the $Gaia$ satellite. For the first time, these elements include life-essential nitrogen to complement carbon, and oxygen as well as more measurements of rare-earth elements critical to modern-life electronics, offering unparalleled insights into the chemical composition of the Milky Way.
  For this release, we use neural networks to simultaneously fit stellar parameters and abundances across the full spectrum, leveraging synthetic grids computed with Spectroscopy Made Easy. These grids account for atomic line formation in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium for 14 elements. In a two-iteration process, we first fit stellar labels for all 1 085 520 spectra, then co-add repeated observations and refine these labels using astrometric data from $Gaia$ and 2MASS photometry, improving the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters and abundances. Our validation thoroughly assesses the reliability of spectroscopic measurements and highlights key caveats for catalogue users.
  GALAH DR4 represents yet another milestone in Galactic archaeology, combining detailed chemical compositions from multiple nucleosynthetic channels with kinematic information and age estimates. The resulting dataset, covering nearly a million stars, opens new avenues for understanding not only the chemical and dynamical history of the Milky Way, but also the broader questions of the origin of elements and the evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Knot-detection algorithm to measure viscosity in three-dimensional MHD plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project explores the mathematical study of knots and links in topology, focusing on differentiating between the two-component Unlink and the Hopf Link using a computational tool named LINKAGE. LINKAGE employs the linking number, calculated through Barycentric Equations, Matrix Algebra, and basic topological principles, to quantify the degree of linking between two closed curves in three-dimensional space. This approach not only distinguishes between different knot structures but also has applications in understanding complex systems such as magnetic field lines in plasma physics. Additionally, this project includes an example where multiple interlinked loops were analyzed over different time stamps using the LINKAGE algorithm. By observing how these links break and evolve, the algorithm demonstrates its ability to track changes in the topological properties of the system. This dynamic analysis shows the versatility of the tool in studying evolving systems, where the topology of the components can change, providing valuable information about the underlying physical processes driving these changes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1810.08444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test the capabilities of 0.4 m telescopes equipped with an \'{e}chelle spectrograph to derive fundamental parameters and elemental abundances of four late-B type stars: HR 342, HR 769, HR 1284, and HR 8705. The medium resolution (R~14000) spectra covering the wavelength range of 4380-7350 {\AA} of the four stars have been obtained using the 40-cm-telescope in Ankara University Kreiken Observatory (AUKR). Using spectrum synthesis, we were able to derive the abundances of eleven chemical elements. We find that these stars do not show remarkable departures from the solar abundances, except for HR 8705 and the primary component of HR 1284, which exhibit slight underabundances of a few elements, i.e., O, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe. We also find that HR 1284 is probably a new spectroscopic binary star. In order to model the spectrum of this object, one of us (TK) has developed a new graphic interface which allows us to synthesize the composite spectrum of binary stars.</description>

      <title>Changing CO Bands in Near-IR Spectra of CP Cephei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present time-series near-infrared spectra for the classical Cepheid, CP Cephei, from the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope and near-infrared spectrograph, TripleSpec, at Apache Point Observatory, NM, USA. Spectral observations were made at nine points through the minimum and partway up the ascending portion of the optical light curve for the star. Carbon monoxide (CO) was detected in absorption in the 2.3-$\mu$m region for each observation. We measured the strength of CO absorption using the 2-0 band head in the feature for each observation and confirm that the CO varies with pulsation. We show that these measurements follow the $(J-K)$ colour curve, confirming that temperature drives the destruction of CO. By obtaining convolved filter magnitudes from the spectral data we found that the effect of the CO feature on $K$ magnitudes is small, unlike the CO feature in the mid-infrared at 4.5-$\mu$m. The dissociation of CO in the near-infrared spectra tracks with the effect seen in the mid-infrared photometric measurements of a similar Galactic Cepheid. Confirmation of the varying CO feature illustrates the need for further investigations into the related mid-infrared period-colour-metallicity relation in order to address the impact of Cepheid metallicities on the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: Most of the stars in the Universe are M spectral class dwarfs, which are known to be the source of bright and frequent stellar flares. In this paper, we propose new approaches to discover M-dwarf flares in ground-based photometric surveys. We employ two approaches: a modification of a traditional method of parametric fit search and a machine learning algorithm based on active anomaly detection. The algorithms are applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data release 8, which includes the data from the ZTF high-cadence survey, allowing us to reveal flares lasting from minutes to hours. We analyze over 35 million ZTF light curves and visually scrutinize 1168 candidates suggested by the algorithms to filter out artifacts, occultations of a star by an asteroid, and other types of known variable objects. The result of this analysis is the largest catalogue of ZTF flaring stars to date, representing 134 flares with amplitudes ranging from -0.2 to -4.6 magnitudes, including repeated flares. Using Pan-STARRS DR2 colors, we assign a spectral subclass to each object in the sample. For 13 flares with well-sampled light curves and available geometric distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate the bolometric energy. This research shows that the proposed methods combined with the ZTF's cadence strategy are suitable for identifying M-dwarf flares and other fast transients, allowing for the extraction of significant astrophysical information from their light curves.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Study of on-disk Coronal Hole Jets with IRIS and SDO observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar jets are an important field of study, as they may contribute to the mass and energy transfer from the lower to the upper atmosphere. We use the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) observations to study two small-scale jets originating in the same on-disk coronal hole observed in October 2013. We combine dopplergrams, intensity maps, and line width maps derived from IRIS Si IV 1393.755 $\r{A}$ spectra along with images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO to describe the dynamics of the jets. Images from AIA, with the use of the emission measure loci technique and rectangular differential emission measure (DEM) distributions, provide estimations of the plasma temperatures. We used the O IV 1399.77 $\r{A}$, 1401.16 $\r{A}$ spectral lines from IRIS to derive electron densities. For jet 1, the SDO images show a small mini-filament 2 minutes before the jet eruption, while jet 2 originates at a pre-existing coronal bright point. The analysis of asymmetric spectral profiles of the Si IV 1393.755 $\r{A}$ and 1402.770 $\r{A}$ lines reveals the existence of two spectral components with inversely dependant 1393.755 $\r{A}$/1402.770 $\r{A}$ ratios at both regions. One of the components can be related to the background plasma emission originating outside the jet, while the secondary component represents higher-energy plasma flows associated with the jets. Both jets exhibit high densities of the order of 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ at their base and 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the spire, respectively, as well as similar average nonthermal velocities of $\sim$ 50-60 km/s. However, the two jets show differences in their length, duration, and plane-of-sky velocity. Finally, the DEM analysis reveals that both jets exhibit multithermal distributions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dense matter equation of state with new NICER mass-radius measurements and new chiral effective field theory inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulse profile modeling of X-ray data from NICER is now enabling precision inference of neutron star mass and radius. Combined with nuclear physics constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), and masses and tidal deformabilities inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary neutron star mergers, this has lead to a steady improvement in our understanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS). Here we consider the impact of several new results: the radius measurement for the 1.42$\,M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 presented by Choudhury et al. (2024), updates to the masses and radii of PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, and new $\chi$EFT results for neutron star matter up to 1.5 times nuclear saturation density. Using two different high-density EOS extensions -- a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS) -- we find the radius of a 1.4$\,M_\odot$ (2.0$\,M_\odot$) neutron star to be constrained to the 95% credible ranges $12.28^{+0.50}_{-0.76}\,$km ($12.33^{+0.70}_{-1.34}\,$km) for the PP model and $12.01^{+0.56}_{-0.75}\,$km ($11.55^{+0.94}_{-1.09}\,$km) for the CS model. The maximum neutron star mass is predicted to be $2.15^{+0.14}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ and $2.08^{+0.28}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ for the PP and CS model, respectively. We explore the sensitivity of our results to different orders and different densities up to which $\chi$EFT is used, and show how the astrophysical observations provide constraints for the pressure at intermediate densities. Moreover, we investigate the difference $R_{2.0} - R_{1.4}$ of the radius of 2$\,M_\odot$ and 1.4$\,M_\odot$ neutron stars within our EOS inference.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey II: The 12C/13C ratios of three young brown dwarfs with CRIRES$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($&gt;3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.</description>

      <title>3D Radiation-Hydrodynamical Simulations of Shadows on Transition Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shadows are often observed in transition disks, which can result from obscuring by materials closer to the star, such as a misaligned inner disk. While shadows leave apparent darkened emission as observational signatures, they have significant dynamical impact on the disk. We carry out 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to study shadows in transition disks and find that the temperature drop due to the shadow acts as an asymmetric driving force, leading to spirals in the cavity. These spirals have zero pattern speed following the fixed shadow. The pitch angle is given by tan$^{-1}$($c_s$/$v_\phi$) (6$^{\circ}$ if $h/r$=0.1). These spirals transport mass through the cavity efficiently, with $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$ in our simulation. Besides spirals, the cavity edge can also form vortices and flocculent streamers. When present, these features could disturb the shadow-induced spirals. By carrying out Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations, we show that these features resemble those observed in near-infrared scattered light images. In the vertical direction, the vertical gravity is no longer balanced by the pressure gradient alone. Instead, an azimuthal convective acceleration term balances the gravity-pressure difference, leading to azimuthally periodic upward and downward gas motion reaching 10% of the sound speed, which can be probed by ALMA line observations.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>
