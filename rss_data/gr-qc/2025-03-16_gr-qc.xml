      <title>Warm Inflation in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate warm inflation for the FRW universe model in the background of $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. We set up the field equations under slow-roll approximations and used a workable power-law model to assess the slow-roll parameters, scalar and tensor power spectra, and their associated spectral indices. The main way warm inflation differs from other types of inflation is that it operates under the premise that radiation and inflaton both exist and interact during the inflationary process. This contact causes energy to transfer from the inflaton to the radiation following the warming process, which keeps the universe warm. Here, we have used $f(Q)$ dark energy as the driving agent to set up the warm inflationary mechanism. In a highly dissipative context, warm inflation has been investigated for two different toy models, with intriguing findings. We find that a warm inflationary scenario in the early universe can be effectively driven by the $f(Q)$ dark energy. Finally, compliance was found when the model and observational data were matched.</description>

      <title>Dark matter halos modeled by polytropic spheres influenced by the relict cosmological constant and trapping polytropes forming supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dark matter halos modeled by general relativistic polytropic spheres in spacetimes with the repulsive cosmological constant representing vacuum energy density, governed by a polytropic index $n$ and a relativistic (cosmological) parameter $\sigma$ ($\lambda$) determining the ratio of central pressure (vacuum energy density) and central energy density of the fluid. To give mapping of the polytrope parameters for matching extension and mass of large dark matter halos, we study properties of the polytropic spheres and introduce an effective potential of the geodesic motion in their internal spacetime. Circular geodesics enable us to find the limits of the trapping polytropes with central regions containing trapped null geodesics; supermassive black holes can be formed due to the instability of the central region against gravitational perturbations. Stability of the polytropic spheres relative to radial perturbations is determined. We match extension and mass of the polytropes to those of dark matter halos related to large galaxies or galaxy clusters, with extension $100 &lt; \ell/\mathrm{kpc} &lt; 5000$ and gravitational mass $10^{12} &lt; M/M_\odot &lt; 5 \times 10^{15}$. The observed velocity profiles simulated by the phenomenological dark matter halo density profiles can be well matched also by the velocity profiles of the exact polytrope spacetimes. The matching is possible by the non-relativistic polytropes for each value of $n$, with relativistic parameter $\sigma \leq 10^{-4}$ and very low central energy density. Surprisingly, the matching works for ``spread'' relativistic polytropes with $n &gt; 3.3$ and $\sigma \geq 0.1$ when the central density can be much larger. The trapping polytropes forming supermassive black holes must have $n &gt; 3.8$ and $\sigma &gt; 0.667$.</description>

      <title>Tainted Love: Systematic biases from ignoring environmental tidal effects in gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black hole systems are typically assumed to evolve in vacuum. However, the environment surrounding the binary components can influence their properties, such as their tidal deformability, affecting the gravitational waveform produced by the binary and its interpretation in gravitational wave data analysis. In this work we focus on next-generation experiments, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, and we quantify the systematic biases in gravitational wave observations that arise when tidally deformed binaries are interpreted as occurring in vacuum. We consider binaries over a range of masses and we compare different phenomenological models for the dynamical evolution of the tidal deformability. We find that systematic biases could significantly affect the measurability of the binary parameters if tidal effects are not carefully modeled.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how the classical notions of time and causal structure may emerge together with quantum-mechanical probabilities from a universal quantum state. For this, the process of decoherence between semiclassical branches is important. Our discussion is based on quantum geometrodynamics, a canonical approach to quantum gravity. In this framework, a particular boundary condition may illuminate the issue of the arrow of (classical) time in connection to the growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Complex Riemannian Spacetime, Removal of Black Hole Singularities And Black Hole Paradoxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach is presented to resolve key paradoxes in black hole physics through the application of complex Riemannian spacetime. We extend the Schwarzschild metric into the complex domain, employing contour integration techniques to remove singularities while preserving essential features of the original solution. A new regularized radial coordinate is introduced, leading to a singularity-free description of black hole interiors. Crucially, we demonstrate how this complex extension resolves the long-standing paradox of event horizon formation occurring only in the infinite future of distant observers. By analyzing trajectories in complex spacetime, we show that the horizon can form in finite complex time, reconciling the apparent contradiction between proper and coordinate time descriptions. This approach also provides a framework for the analytic continuation of information across event horizons, resolving the Hawking information paradox. We explore the physical interpretation of the complex extension versus its projection onto real spacetime. The gravitational collapse of a dust sphere with negligible dust is explored in the complex spacetime extension. The approach offers a mathematically rigorous framework for exploring quantum gravity effects within the context of classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Static spherically symmetric solutions of the f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric (SSS) solutions of f(R) gravity are studied in the Einstein frame. The solutions involve SSS configuration mass M and scalaron mass $\mu$ (in geometrized units); for typical astrophysical masses, the dimensionless parameter $M\mu$ has very large value. We found analytic solutions on a finite interval for $M\mu\to \infty$ in case of a family of scalaron potentials. The asymptotically flat solutions on $(0,\infty)$ have been studied numerically for $M\mu$ up to $10^{20}$ in case of the quadratic f(R) model.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee gravity: spherically-symmetric solutions away from the potential minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a vector model of spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking coupled to gravity: the bumblebee model. The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. Complementing previous work on black hole solutions, we study the effects on the solutions when the vector field does not lie at the minimum of its potential. We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatics model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source. Finally, we discuss observational constraints on these spacetimes using the resulting orbital behavior.</description>

      <title>Connecting Relativistic MOND Theories with Mimetic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a connection between relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theories and (scalar) mimetic gravity. We first demonstrate that any relativistic MOND model featuring a unit-timelike vector field, such as TeVeS or Aether-scalar-tensor theory, can be embedded within a conformal/disformal-invariant framework. Gauge fixing the conformal/disformal symmetry amounts to imposing a constraint on the norm of the vector, the scalar field or the cross contraction. Notably, we find that these constraints can be interchanged as long as the vector and scalar fields remain timelike. This means that relativistic MOND theories may be recasted as a mimetic gravity theory. Lastly, by constructing the fundamental building blocks of a conformal-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theory, we establish a new framework for developing relativistic MOND theories. This perspective offers deeper insight into how non-invertible disformal transformations and conformal/disformal symmetries serve as fundamental principles in constructing viable alternatives to dark matter.</description>

      <title>Spinor field in Bianchi type-I cosmology with Lyras geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the role of a nonlinear spinor field in the evolution of the Universe within the framework of a Bianchi type-I cosmological model with Lyras geometry. Previous research has explored the nonlinear spinor field in various anisotropic and isotropic cosmological models, revealing that the presence of nontrivial, non-diagonal components of the spinor field's energy-momentum tensor imposes severe restrictions on both the space-time geometry and the spinor field itself. In our current study, we find that while these restrictions still apply, the introduction of Lyras geometry significantly influences the evolution of the Universe. This influence arises from the fact that the invariants of the spinor field are dependent on the Lyra geometry parameter.</description>

      <title>Metastable Cosmological Constant and Gravitational Bubbles: Ultra-Late-Time Transitions in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed cosmological constant may originate as the minimum value $U_{min}$ of a scalar field potential, where the scalar field is frozen due to a large mass. If this vacuum is metastable, it may decay to a true vacuum either at present or in the future. Assuming its decay rate $\Gamma$ is comparable to the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, we estimate the scale of true vacuum bubbles and analyze their evolution. We find that their initial formation scale is sub-millimeter and their tension causes rapid collapse if $m \gtrsim 1.7 \cdot 10^{-3}\, eV$. For smaller masses, the bubbles expand at the speed of light. We extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories with non-minimal coupling, finding that the nucleation scale of gravitational constant bubbles remains consistent with the sub-millimeter regime of General Relativity. The critical mass scale remains around $10^{-3}\,eV$. A theoretical estimate at redshift $z_{obs} \sim 0.01$ suggests an observable bubble radius of $\sim 50$ Mpc, implying a gravitational transition triggered $\sim 300$ Myr ago, with a present-day size approaching $100$ Mpc. Additionally, we explore mass ranges ($m &lt; 10^{-3}\,eV$) and non-minimal coupling $\xi$ ranges ($10^{-8}\,eV^{2-n} - 10^{-1}\,eV^{2-n}$) that lead to a variation $\Delta G/G_N$ within the $1\%-7\%$ range. We assume non-minimal coupling of the form $F(\phi)=1/\kappa - \xi \phi^n$, with $\kappa=8\pi G_N$ and $2 \leq n \leq 9$. Finally, we review various local physics or/and transition based proposed solutions to the Hubble tension, including ultra-late-time transitional models (\(z \sim 0.01\)), screened fifth-force mechanisms, and the \(\Lambda_s\)CDM model, which features a transition at \(z \sim 2\). We discuss observational hints supporting these scenarios and the theoretical challenges they face.</description>

      <title>On the phase transition mechanism of spontaneous scalarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain modified gravity theories that include additional scalar degrees of freedom, compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars may undergo a process known as spontaneous scalarization, in which the scalar field is suddenly activated beyond a certain critical point. Since its discovery, it has been clear that this effect can be understood in many cases as a continuous phase transition, well described by the phenomenological Landau model. Recently, it has been pointed out that spontaneous scalarization can also manifest as a first-order phase transition. In this paper, we take a closer look at the nature of spontaneous scalarization as a phase transition, analyzing in detail cases where it occurs as either a second- or first-order transition, as well as a more unconventional scenario characterized by a negative scalar susceptibility. Critical exponents are explicitly computed and implications for dynamical scalarization are discussed.</description>

      <title>Shadow formation in gravitational collapse: redshift and blueshift by spacetime dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A black hole illuminated by a background light source is observed as a black hole shadow. For a black hole formed by gravitational collapse of a transmissive object, redshift of light due to the spacetime dynamics is expected to play a crucial role in the shadow formation. In this paper, we investigate the redshift of light caused by the spacetime dynamics. First, we consider a spherical shell model. We see that the collapse of the shell typically leads to the redshift of light, while blueshift can be also observed in some cases. This result suggests that a shadow image is generally formed in the late stage of the gravitational collapse of a transmissive object. Second, we propose a covariant formula for the redshift of light in a general, dynamical, and spherically symmetric spacetime. This formula relates the redshift to the energy-momentum tensor of the background spacetime and provides its intuitive interpretation with a Newtonian analogy. The redshift effect analyzed in this work is regarded as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or the Rees-Sciama effect in gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Superconvergent Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Scalar Teukolsky Equation on Hyperboloidal Domains: Efficient Waveform and Self-Force Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-time evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems requires minimal phase and dispersion errors to accurately compute far-field waveforms, while high accuracy is essential near the smaller black hole (modeled as a Dirac delta distribution) for self-force computations. Spectrally accurate methods, such as nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, are well suited for these tasks. Their numerical errors typically decrease as $\propto (\Delta x)^{N+1}$, where $\Delta x$ is the subdomain size and $N$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation. However, certain DG schemes exhibit superconvergence, where truncation, phase, and dispersion errors can decrease as fast as $\propto (\Delta x)^{2N+1}$. Superconvergent numerical solvers are, by construction, extremely efficient and accurate. We theoretically demonstrate that our DG scheme for the scalar Teukolsky equation with a distributional source is superconvergent, and this property is retained when combined with the hyperboloidal layer compactification technique. This ensures that waveforms, total energy and angular-momentum fluxes, and self-force computations benefit from superconvergence. We empirically verify this behavior across a family of hyperboloidal layer compactifications with varying degrees of smoothness. Additionally, we show that self-force quantities for circular orbits, computed at the point particle's location, also exhibit a certain degree of superconvergence. Our results underscore the potential benefits of numerical superconvergence for efficient and accurate gravitational waveform simulations based on DG methods.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from a Sharp Feature in Three-field Inflation II: The Inflationary Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09023v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the contribution of large scalar perturbations sourced by a sharp feature during cosmic inflation to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), extending our previous work to include the SGWB sourced during the inflationary era. We focus in particular on three-field inflation, since the third dynamical field is the first not privileged by the perturbations' equations of motion and allows a more direct generalization to $N$-field inflation. For the first time, we study the three-field isocurvature perturbations sourced during the feature and include the effects of isocurvature masses. In addition to a two-field limit, we find that the third field's dynamics during the feature can source large isocurvature transients which then later decay, leaving an inflationary-era-sourced SGWB as their only observable signature. We find that the inflationary-era signal shape near the peak is largely independent of the number of dynamical fields and has a greatly enhanced amplitude sourced by the large isocurvature transient, suppressing the radiation-era contribution and opening a new window of detectable parameter space with small adiabatic enhancement. The largest enhancements we study could easily violate backreaction constraints, but much of parameter space remains under perturbative control. These SGWBs could be visible in LISA and other gravitational wave experiments, leaving an almost universal signature of sharp features during multi-field inflation, even when the sourcing isocurvature decays to unobservability shortly afterwards.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state, or implementing a unitary, using limited resources. Over the past decade, quantum-complexity research has surged. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter and quantum gravity. Different communities apply different tools to quantum complexity, as well as define complexity differently. This review bridges the disciplines' approaches. We cover multiple definitions of complexity, as well as their key properties and applications. In quantum information, random quantum circuits proved to be an invaluable tool in extracting properties of the complexity growth of discrete quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), complexity is defined geometrically through geodesics. Complexity can be defined also in terms of state or operator spreading and tensor-network concepts. In addition to reviewing these approaches, we outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models and QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we detail the relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the anti-de Sitter-space (AdS)/CFT correspondence. This review thereby integrates recent quantum-complexity advances across fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation between simulated binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum description of a black hole predicts that quantum information hidden behind the event horizon can be teleported outside almost instantaneously. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral spin-chain model, which naturally simulates a binary black hole system, can realise this teleportation process. Our system captures two essential components of this protocol: Hawking radiation, which generates the necessary entanglement between the black holes, and optimal scrambling, which enables high-fidelity teleportation on short timescales. Through numerical simulations, we quantify the key timescales governing the process, including the Page time, radiation time, scrambling time, and butterfly velocity, showing their universal dependence on the chiral coupling strength. Our results establish the feasibility of simulating quantum properties of black holes within condensed matter systems, offering an experimentally accessible platform for probing otherwise inaccessible high-energy phenomena.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on SIGW with Future Pulsar Timing Array Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Gravitational Redshift: Transport Signatures of Massless Dirac Fermions in Tilted Dirac Cone Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electron waves in a two-dimensional tilted Dirac cone heterostructure where tilt depends on the coordinate $z$ along the junction. The resulting Dirac equation in an emergent curved spacetime for the spinor $\psi(z)$ can be efficiently solved using 4th-order Runge-Kutta numerical method by a transformation to a "suitable" spinor $\varphi$ where the resulting Dirac cone looks locally upright. The spatial texture of the tilt induces oscillatory behaviors in key physical quantities such as the norm $|\varphi(z)|^2$ of the wave function, polar and azimuthal angles $\Theta(z)$ and $\Phi(z)$ of the pseudospin, and the integrated transmission $\tau$ where oscillation wave-lengths get shorter (longer) in stronger (weaker) tilt regions. Such an oscillatory behavior reminiscent of gravitational red-shift is an indicator of an underlying spacetime metric that can be probed in tunneling experiments. We derive analytical approximations for the position-dependent wave numbers $\Delta k_z(z)$ that explain the red-shift patterns and corroborate them with numerical simulations. For a tilt "bump" spread over length scale $\ell$, upon increasing $\ell$, the amplitude of red-shifted oscillations reduces whereas the number of peaks increases. The scale invariance of Dirac equation allows to probe these aspects of $\ell$-dependence by a voltage sweep in transmission experiments. Smooth variations of the tilt reduce impedance mismatch of the electron waves, thereby giving rise to very high transmission rate. This concept can be used in combination with a sigmoid-shaped tilt texture for red-shift or blue-shift engineering of the transmitted waves, depending on whether the sigmoid is downswing or upswing.</description>

      <title>Observed galaxy number counts on the lightcone up to third order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a detailed derivation of the observed galaxy number over-density obtained by computing cosmological perturbations up to third order in redshift space and on very large scales. We compute all the relativistic and projection effects, arising from the observation of galaxies on the past light cone, including all redshift effects, i.e. peculiar velocities, Sachs-Wolfe (SW) effects, integrated SW effects, gravitational lensing and time delay terms. Moreover, we have considered all post- and post-post-Born contributions from the photon geodesic equations in order to take into account all possible effects due to the lensing distortions. The derivation is performed in the Poisson gauge. This work largely follows the formalism used in (Bertacca et al. 2014a, Bertacca et al. 2014b, Bertacca 2015, Bertacca et al. 2020), pushing it for the first time up to the third perturbative order. This result will be important for a variety of applications, such as a complete estimation of projection effects and the investigation of possible parity violation signatures in the 3- and 4-point galaxy correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Strings beyond Kination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel mechanism for the production of a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed in the context of a kinating background driven by the volume modulus of string compactifications. In this paper, we generalise the analysis of this growth mechanism by using dynamical system techniques. We first study the cosmological growth of strings in a spatially-flat Universe filled with a perfect fluid and a field-dependent tension, finding the fixed points of the phase space of this system. We then apply this analysis to fundamental strings and EFT strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$-cycles. We find a cosmological growth for fundamental strings even without kination, as in scaling fixed points, and for EFT strings arising from D3- and NS5-branes wrapped around fibration cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that alternative theories to the Standard Model allow -- and sometimes require -- fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, to vary in spacetime. We demonstrate that one way to investigate these variations is through the Mass-Radius relation of compact astrophysical objects, which is inherently affected by $\alpha$ variations. We start by considering the model of a polytropic white dwarf, which we perturb by adding the $\alpha$ variations for a generic class of Grand Unified Theories. We then extend our analysis to neutron stars, building upon the polytropic approach to consider more realistic equations of state, discussing the impact of such variations on mass-radius measurements in neutron stars. We present some constraints on these models based on current data and also outline how future observations might distinguish between extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of wave packets from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence to AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ and examine properties of their energy density. We find that, while the energy still localizes on the light cone, its spatial distribution exhibits momentum dependence and is no longer localized in higher dimensions. This result is significant as it reflects leading $1/N$ corrections to the generalized free field theory associated with the free bulk theory at $N=\infty$. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on entanglement wedge reconstruction including $1/N$ corrections, and also provide new insights into the structure of wave packets in higher-dimensional holography.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Redshift from Galaxy Clusters -- a Relativistic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light that we receive from clusters of galaxies is redshifted by the presence of the clusters' gravitational potential. This effect, known as gravitational redshift, is an early prediction of Einstein occurring in any metric theory of gravity. As a direct consequence, the central galaxy, located near the bottom of the gravitational potential, is observed to be more redshifted than the cluster members. In 2011, a first detection of this redshift difference on cluster scales was achieved and compared with theoretical predictions for gravitational redshift in various theories of gravity. However, the interpretation of this result has been challenged by several later studies, which emphasised the possible influence of additional kinematic effects on the observed signal from stacked clusters. In this work, we present the first derivation of all such effects within a relativistic framework, accurate to third order in the weak-field approximation. This framework allows us to correctly capture the hierarchy of terms at the scale of clusters, while accounting for all relativistic effects. We compare our result with previous literature and show that some terms were not properly included, leading to an overestimation of the kinematic contamination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an effort to understand the Penrose inequality for black holes with angular momentum, an axisymmetric, vacuum, asymptotically Euclidean initial data set subject to certain quasi-stationary conditions is considered for a case study. A new geometric definition of angular velocity of a rotating black hole is defined in terms of the momentum constraint, without any reference to a stationary Killing vector field. The momentum constraint is then shown to be equivalent to the dynamics of a two-dimensional steady compressible fluid flow governed by a quasi-conformal mapping. In terms of spinors, a generalised first law for rotating black holes (possibly with multi-connected horizon located along the symmetry axis) is then proven and may be regarded as a Penrose-type inequality for black holes with angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe gauge theories which allow to retrieve a large class of gravitational theories, including, MacDowell-Mansouri gravity and its topological extension to Loop Quantum Gravity via the Pontrjagin characteristic class involving the Nieh-Yan term. Considering symmetric spaces parametrized by mutations allows to naturally obtain a bare cosmological constant which in particular cases gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant while having an AdS spacetime.
  Two examples are studied, Lorentzian geometry (including dS and AdS spacetimes) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl geometry. In the latter case we prove the equations of motion exhibit a secondary source for curvature in addition to the usual energy-momentum tensor. This additional source is expressed in terms of the spin density of matter, torsion and their variations.
  Finally, we show that the gauge + matter actions constructed from invariant polynomials are asymptotically topological if one assumes a vanishing bare cosmological constant together with gauge and matter fields having compact support.</description>

Abstract: We take into account redshift-space distortion measurements to investigate the growth of cosmological large-scale structures within the framework of modified symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity. After comparing the predictions of the $f(Q)$-gravity expansion history with OHD and SNIa Pantheon+ sample datasets and constraining the pertinent cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m}$ and $H_0$, together with the exponent $n$ for $f(Q)$ power-law models, we derive the full system of equations governing linear cosmological perturbations to study matter fluctuations using the $1 + 3$ covariant formalism when applied to $f(Q)$ gravity. Thus, we resort to both the usual redshift-space distortion data $f\sigma_8$ and some recent separate measurements of the growth rate $f$ and the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$ from the VIPERS and SDSS collaborations to find the best-fit cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $n$. We also apply a collective analysis of such growth-structure data together with the aforementioned cosmic expansion measurements, to restrict these parameters through Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations. determining the statistical significance for the best-fit parameter values through the AIC and BIC Bayesian selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Accretion Structures around Kerr Black Holes in a Swirling Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate thick accretion structures around Kerr black holes in a swirling background. This stationary and axisymmetric spacetime is composed of a rotating black hole, which is immersed in a rotating background. The swirling background is characterized by an odd $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, where the northern and southern hemispheres are rotating in opposite directions. The presence of the Kerr rotation leads to the emergence of complex spin-spin interactions with the background rotation, which heavily influence the spacetime properties. In order to study this influence, we analyze circular orbits and geometrically thick disks for different spacetime solutions, that are classified by their Kerr parameter $a$ and the swirling parameter $j$. We identify stabilizing effects on prograde circular orbits and destabilizing effects on retrograde circular orbits, which originate from the spin-spin interaction and depend mainly on the Kerr rotation. Furthermore, we discovered the emergence of static orbits, which appear due to the background rotation. The symmetry breaking with regard to the equatorial plane causes a concave (convex) distribution of prograde (retrograde) circular orbits and accordingly, bowl-like deformations of the accretion disk structures. The parameter space for disk solutions gets heavily downsized by the appearance of an outer marginally stable orbit. Due to the possibility of an outer and inner disk cusp, different types of disk solutions are possible. We classify the different types of disk solutions, which differ from each other by the properties of their cusps. Four different scenarios can be identified in which different accretion dynamics could arise.</description>

      <title>Tides and traversability in gravastars and other related geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal effects related to the traversability across thin shells are examined in spherically symmetric geometries. We focus mainly on shells separating inner from outer regions of gravastars (de Sitter -- i.e. $\Lambda&gt;0$ -- interior and Schwarzschild exterior of mass parameter $M$), but we also examine other related geometries by including the possibility of a negative cosmological constant and, besides, non trivial topologies where the shell separates two outer regions. The analysis is developed for radially traversing objects and for tides in both radial and transverse directions, which present difficulties of somewhat different nature. Transverse tides across shells which satisfy the flare-out condition are the most troublesome, while shells in trivial topologies, i.e. geometries with one asymptotic region, are more indulgent with the issue of large tides. Besides, contradicting other cases analyzed in previous works, we find that large radial tides cannot be avoided when traveling across the shell in the gravastar solution, but in non-trivial topologies they can. We study with special attention the traversability in practice of the transition layer in the thin-shell gravastar solution. In particular, a finite object which traverses radially the shell in a gravastar with $\sqrt{\Lambda}\ll 1/M$ undergoes a compression effect in both the transverse and the radial directions due to the tides associated to the thin layer. The results are interpreted in terms of the total momentum transfer obtained by integrating the travel time of the object.</description>

      <title>Weak field deflection angle and analytical parameter estimation of the Lorentz-violating Bumblebee parameter through the black hole shadow using EHT data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explored how the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $\ell$ affects the Reissner-Nordst\"{o}m BH solution in the context of weak field deflection angle, and the black hole shadow. We aim to derive the general expression for the weak deflection angle using the non-asymptotic version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and we presented a way to simplify the calculations under the assumption that the distance of the source and the receiver are the same. \textcolor{black}{Through the Solar System test, $\ell$ is constrained from around $-10^{-9}$ orders of magnitude to $0$, implying challenging detection of $\ell$ through the deflection of light rays from the Sun.} We also studied the black hole shadow in an analytic way, where we applied the EHT results under the far approximation in obtaining an estimate expression for $\ell$. Using the realistic values of the black hole mass and observer distance for Sgr. A* and M87*, it was shown that $M/r_{\rm o} \neq 1$ is satisfied, implying the relevance and potential promise of the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter's role on the shadow radius uncertainties as measured by the EHT. \textcolor{black}{We find constraints for $\ell$ to be negatively valued, where the upper and lower bounds are $\sim -1.94$ and $\sim -2.04$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A complete waveform comparison of post-Newtonian and numerical relativity in eccentric orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a thorough comparative analysis between post-Newtonian (PN) and numerically relativistic (NR) waveforms in eccentric orbits, covering nonspinning and spin-aligned configurations. The comparison examines frequency, amplitude, and phase characteristics of various harmonic modes, such as 22, 21, 33, 32, 44, 43, and 55 modes. The study utilizes eccentric PN waveforms based on 3PN quasi-Keplerian parameterization with 3PN radiative reaction, surpassing Newtonian quadrupole moment with higher-order moments. NR waveforms from RIT and SXS catalogs span mass ratios from 1/4 to 1, eccentricities up to 0.45, and durations exceeding $17000M$ across nonspinning and spin-aligned configurations. Focusing on the 22 mode, frequency comparisons between quadrupole and higher-order moments of $\Psi_4^{22}$ and $h^{22}$ were conducted. Amplitude comparisons revealed superior accuracy in quadrupole moments of $\Psi_4^{22}$. Analysis of total 180 sets of eccentric waveforms showed increasing fitting residuals with rising eccentricity, correlating with smaller mass ratios. Comparisons of initial eccentricity from PN fitting, 3PN quasi-Keplerian parameterization, and RIT/SXS catalogs revealed alignment discrepancies. Frequency, phase, and amplitude comparisons of 22 modes showed consistent inspiral behavior between PN and NR, with divergences near merger for nonspinning PN and pre-200M for spin-aligned PN.</description>

      <title>Squeezed vacua and primordial features in effective theories of inflation at N2LO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite duration of cosmic inflation can result in features $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(k) = |\alpha_k-\beta_k\,\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\delta_k}|^2 \,\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}(k)$ in the primordial power spectrum that carry information about a quantum gravity phase before inflation. While the almost scale-invariant power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}$ for the quasi-Bunch-Davies vacuum is fully determined by the inflationary background dynamics, the Bogoliubov coefficients $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ for the squeezed vacuum depend on new physics beyond inflation and have been used to produce phenomenological templates for the features. The phase $\delta_k$ vanishes in de Sitter space and therefore is often neglected, but it results in non-trivial effects in quasi-de Sitter inflationary geometries. Here we consider a large class of effective theories of inflation and provide a closed-form expression for $\delta_k$ and for the fully expanded power spectrum up to next-to-next-leading order (N2LO) in the Hubble-flow expansion. In particular, for the Starobinsky model of inflation we find that this relative phase can be expressed in terms of the scalar tilt $n_\mathrm{s}$ as $\delta_{k\ast}=\frac{\pi}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)-\frac{\pi}{4}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2\,\ln(k/k_*)$. The relative phase results in a negative shift and a running frequency that have been considered in the most studied phenomenological templates for primordial features, thus providing precise theoretical predictions for upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Scattering of Black Holes: Assessing Resummation Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in post-Minkowksian (PM) calculations have led to a fast-growing body of weak-field perturbative information. As such, there is major interest within the gravitational wave community as to how this information can be used to improve the accuracy of theoretical waveform models. In this work, we build on recent efforts to validate high-order PM calculations using numerical relativity simulations. We present a new set of high-energy scattering simulations for equal-mass, non-spinning binary black holes, further expanding the existing suite of NR simulations. We outline the basic features of three recently proposed resummation schemes (the $\mathscr{L}$-resummed model, the $w^\mathrm{eob}$ model and the SEOB-PM model) and compare the analytical predictions to our NR data. Each model is shown to demonstrate pathological behaviour at high energies, with common features such as PM hierarchical shifts and divergences. The NR data can also be used to calibrate pseudo-5PM corrections to the scattering angle or EOB radial potentials. In each case, we argue that including higher-order information improves the agreement between the analytical models and NR, though the extent of improvement depends on how this information is incorporated and the choice of analytical baseline. Finally, we demonstrate that further resummation of the EOB radial potentials could be an effective strategy to improving the model agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The guiding theme of this topical review is provided by the scrutiny of the early history of the space-time curvature through the diffuse backgrounds of gravitational radiation that are sensitive to all the stages of the evolution of the plasma. Due to their broad spectrum (extending from the aHz region to the THz domain) they bridge the macroworld described by general relativity and the microworld of the fundamental constituents of matter. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relic gravitons and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed with particular attention to the interplay between the entanglement entropy and the maximal frequency of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Influence of Quantum Correction on Kerr Black Hole in Effective Loop Quantum Gravity via Shadows and EHT Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a study on shadow of quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity appeared in [Ye et al., Phys. Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] assuming a fixed value of Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following this approach, we considered its rotating counterpart being a quantum corrected Kerr black hole in effective loop quantum gravity and studied its deviation from Kerr black hole for a fixed value of $\gamma$. We proposed and proved a theorem describing the location of unstable circular null orbits for all such Kerr-like metrics. The deviation between the shadows of the Kerr and quantum corrected Kerr black holes has also been studied, and parameters are constrained by comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. Lastly, we immersed the quantum corrected Kerr black hole in an inhomogeneous plasma and studied its impact on the shadow size. We found that the unstable null orbits for the quantum corrected Kerr black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. The effect of Barbero-Immirzi parameter allows the quantum corrected Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum corrected Kerr black hole does not mimic M87*. The plasma reduces the size of the shadow of quantum corrected black hole, and the plasma parameter in the case II is more sensitive than that in case I.</description>

      <title>The continuous spectrum of quasinormal modes in a Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes dominate the dynamics of Schwarzschild black holes. By definition, these modes are purely outgoing at infinite distances. It is believed that the quasinormal mode spectrum is discrete, but the derivation assumes purely outgoing modes at finite distances. We prove that the spectrum is continuous, within the usual definition. Any frequency corresponds to a valid quasinormal mode, and each frequency is two-fold degenerate. Although it is imbedded in a continuum containing less-damped modes, the least-damped discrete mode should play a dominant role in the dynamics, due to its lack of an incoming component at finite distances. On the other hand, we question the physical significance of the discrete overtones relative to the continuum modes, since all highly-damped modes have very small incoming components. Furthermore, it seems likely that the continuous spectrum of quasinormal modes is complete.</description>

      <title>On regular charged black holes in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As argued in arXiv:2104.10172, introducing a non-minimally coupled scalar field, three-dimensional Einstein gravity can be extended by infinite families of theories which admit simple analytic generalizations of the charged BTZ black hole. Depending on the gravitational couplings, the solutions may describe black holes with one or several horizons and with curvature or BTZ-like singularities. In other cases, the metric function behaves as $f(r)\overset{(r\rightarrow 0)}{\sim} \mathcal{O}(r^{2s})$ with $s\geq 1$, and the black holes are completely regular -- a feature unique to three dimensions. Regularity arises generically i.e., without requiring any fine-tuning of parameters. In this paper we show that all these theories satisfy Birkhoff theorems, so that the most general spherically-symmetric solutions are given by the corresponding static black holes. We perform a thorough characterization of the Penrose diagrams of the solutions, finding a rich structure which includes, in particular, cases which tessellate the plane and others in which the diagrams cannot be drawn in a single plane. We also study the motion of probe particles on the black holes, finding that observers falling to regular black holes reach the center after a finite proper time. Contrary to the singular cases, the particles are not torn apart by tidal forces, so they oscillate between antipodal points describing many-universe orbits. We argue that in those cases the region $r=0$ can be interpreted as a horizon with vanishing surface gravity, giving rise to generic inner-extremal regular black hole solutions. We also analyze the deep interior region of the solutions identifying the presence of Kasner eons and the conditions under which they take place. Finally, we construct new black hole solutions in the case in which infinite towers of terms are included in the action.</description>

      <title>Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M&gt;1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we study the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within an effective field theory framework. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at one-loop level. We demonstrate that these quantum gravity effects naturally give rise to the super-extremality of charged black holes, which aligns with a recent result by Arkani-Hamed et al. Furthermore, our formalism provides a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of both extremal and non-extremal RN black holes, offering additional interesting implications.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum criticality near the BTZ black hole horizon: Insights from coupled fermion-antifermion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analytically examine the behavior of a fermion-antifermion pair near the horizon of a static BTZ black hole using a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation with a position-dependent mass. This formulation leads to a set of four first-order equations that can be reduced to a second-order wave equation, enabling the analysis of gravitational effects on quantum interactions. Two mass modifications are considered: (i) \(m \rightarrow m - a/r\), representing an attractive Coulomb interaction, and (ii) \(m \rightarrow m - a/r + b r\), corresponding to a Cornell potential. For case (i), an exact analytical solution is obtained, while for case (ii), conditionally exact solutions involving biconfluent Heun functions are derived. For the lowest mode (\(n=0\)), the results indicate that real oscillations without energy loss occur when \(a &gt; 0.25\) in scenario (i) and \(a &gt; 0.75\) in scenario (ii), suggesting stable oscillatory behavior. When \(a &lt; 0.25\) in scenario (i) or \(a &lt; 0.75\) in scenario (ii), the state exhibits decay, indicating instability below these critical thresholds. At \(a = 0.25\) (scenario (i)) and \(a = 0.75\) (scenario (ii)), the system reaches a state where its evolution ceases over time. These findings provide insights into the stability conditions of fermion-antifermion pairs near the black hole horizon and may have relevance for determining critical coupling strengths in systems such as holographic superconductors. Furthermore, this work adopts an effective semi-classical quantum gravity approach, offering a practical framework for incorporating gravitational effects.</description>

Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

      <title>What exactly does Bekenstein bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound posits a maximum entropy for matter with finite energy confined to a spatial region. It is often interpreted as a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored by physical objects. In this work, we test this interpretation by asking whether the Bekenstein bound imposes constraints on a channel's communication capacity, a context in which information can be given a mathematically rigorous and operationally meaningful definition. We study specifically the \emph{Unruh channel} that describes a stationary Alice exciting different species of free scalar fields to send information to an accelerating Bob, who is confined to a Rindler wedge and exposed to the noise of Unruh radiation. We show that the classical and quantum capacities of the Unruh channel obey the Bekenstein bound that pertains to the decoder Bob. In contrast, even at high temperatures, the Unruh channel can transmit a significant number of \emph{zero-bits}, which are quantum communication resources that can be used for quantum identification and many other primitive protocols. Therefore, unlike classical bits and qubits, zero-bits and their associated information processing capability are generally not constrained by the Bekenstein bound. However, we further show that when both the encoder and the decoder are restricted, the Bekenstein bound does constrain the channel capacities, including the zero-bit capacity.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quantum Yang--Mills at finite temperature beyond lattice: a Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Dyson--Schwinger approach, we perform an analysis of the non-trivial ground state of thermal $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in the non-perturbative regime where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Basic thermodynamic observables such as energy density and pressure are derived analytically, using Jacobi Elliptic functions. The results are compared with lattice results. Good agreement is found at low temperatures, providing a viable scenario of a gas of massive glue states populating higher levels of the spectrum of the theory. At high temperatures a scenario without glue states consistent with a massive scalar field is observed, showing an interesting agreement with lattice data. The possibility is discussed that the results derived in this analysis open up a novel pathway beyond lattice to precision studies of phase transitions with false vacuum and cosmological relics that depend on QCD-like equations of state in strongly coupled gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr data set: Posterior predictive checks for gravitational-wave detection with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar-timing-array experiments have reported evidence for a stochastic background of nanohertz gravitational waves consistent with the signal expected from a population of supermassive--black-hole binaries. Their analyses assume power-law spectra for intrinsic pulsar noise and for the background, as well as a Hellings--Downs cross-correlation pattern among the gravitational-wave--induced residuals across pulsars. These assumptions may not be realized in actuality. We test them in the NANOGrav 15 yr data set using Bayesian posterior predictive checks. After fitting our fiducial model to real data, we generate a population of simulated data-set replications. We use the replications to assess whether the optimal-statistic significance, inter-pulsar correlations, and spectral coefficients are extreme. We recover Hellings--Downs correlations in simulated data sets at significance levels consistent with the correlations measured in the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. A similar test on spectral coefficients shows that their values in real data are not extreme compared to their distributions across replications. We also evaluate the evidence for the stochastic background using posterior-predictive versions of the frequentist optimal statistic and of Bayesian model comparison, and find comparable significance (3.2 $\sigma$ and 3 $\sigma$ respectively) to what was previously reported for the standard statistics. We conclude with novel visualizations of the reconstructed gravitational waveforms that enter the residuals for each pulsar. Our analysis strengthens confidence in the identification and characterization of the gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <title>Condensate decay in a radiation dominated cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\,\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\gamma(t)$ is always \emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: To be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Towards a String Realization of the Dark Dimension via T-folds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Tests for model misspecification in simulation-based inference: from local distortions to global model checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</description>

      <title>Black hole information turbulence and the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major outstanding challenge in cosmology is the persistent discrepancy between the Hubble constant obtained from early and late universe measurements -- the Hubble tension. Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics.</description>
