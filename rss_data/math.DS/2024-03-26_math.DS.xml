      <title>A note on the orbit equivalence of global attractors for S1-equivariant parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we clarify the proof of Theorem 3 of \cite{roc12} about the characterization of global attractors $\cA_f$ for semiflows generated by scalar one-dimensional semilinear parabolic equations of the form $u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x)$, defined on the circle $x\in S^1$, for a class of nonlinearities called of simple type. We modify the proof to make it simpler and amenable to generalization. In addition, we extend this result to the general case of nonlinearities $f=f(u,u_x)$ obtaining a complete orbit equivalence for the global attractors.</description>

      <title>A Triangular Normal Form for x-Flat Control-Affine Two-Input Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to normal forms for x-flat control-affine systems with two inputs. We propose a general triangular normal form which contains several other normal forms discussed in the literature as special cases. We derive conditions under which a system with given x-flat output can be transformed into the proposed triangular form. Based on the triangular form we motivate a simple algorithm for identifying candidates for flat outputs.</description>

      <title>A Linear Time-Delay Scheme to Propagate Reduced Electron Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff and box dimension bounds for subfractals induced by $S$-gap shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider subsets of an attractor of an iterated function system in which each point is associated with an allowable word from an $S$-gap shift. The main result shows that bounds for the box dimension and Hausdorff dimension of a subfractal induced by an $S$-gap shift are given by the zeros of the upper and lower topological pressure functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Y. Azouzi, M.A. Ben Amor, J.M. Homann, M. Masmoudi, B.A. Watson, {\em The Kac formula and Poincar\'e recurrence formula in Riesz spaces}, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 10(2023), 182-194.] we established the Kac formula and Poincar\'e recurrence theorem for conditional expectation preserving systems. Based on the structures built there to study recurrence times, we now give a formulation of the Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition in terms of components of weak order units of Riesz spaces. In addition, we prove that every aperiodic conditional expectation preserving system can be approximated by a periodic one.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Learning of Infinitesimal Generators without Operator Logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has gained significant attention in recent years for its ability to verify evolutionary properties of continuous-time nonlinear systems by lifting state variables into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. The challenge remains in providing estimations for transitional properties pertaining to the system's vector fields based on discrete-time observations. To retrieve such infinitesimal system transition information, leveraging the structure of Koopman operator learning, current literature focuses on developing techniques free of time derivatives through the use of the Koopman operator logarithm. However, the soundness of these methods has so far been demonstrated only for maintaining effectiveness within a restrictive function space, together with knowledge of the operator spectrum properties. To better adapt to the practical applications in learning and control of unknown systems, we propose a logarithm-free technique for learning the infinitesimal generator without disrupting the Koopman operator learning framework. This approach claims compatibility with other system verification tools using the same set of training data. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness in applications of system identification and stability prediction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $\Phi=\{\varphi_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ be a continuous flow on $X$. We introduce two types of topological pressure for family of discontinuous potentials $a=\{a_t\}_{t&gt;0}$. First, define the topological pressure of family of measurable potentials $a=\{a_t\}_{t&gt;0}$ on a subset $Z$ for flow and proof its invariant principle. The second topological pressure is defined on a invariant subset having a nested family of subsets, we also proof its invariant principle.</description>

      <title>The Shadowing Properties Of Nonautonomous Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\left(X_n, d_n\right)$ be a sequence of metric spaces and let $\mathcal{F}=\left\{f_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ be a sequence of continuous and onto maps $f_n: X_n \rightarrow X_{n+1}, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$. In this paper, we prove that if the compression ratio meets $\prod \lambda_i=0$, then there exists $\delta_n&gt;0$ such that any $\delta_n$ - pseudo-orbit $\left\{x_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is $\varepsilon$ - shadowed by a unique point $x \in X_0$. For the asymptotic average shadowing property, we prove that if $\left.\mathcal{F}\right|_A$ has asymptotically average shadowing property, then $\mathcal{F}$ also has a asymptotically average shadowing propertywhen a density-related condition is satisfied. Additionally, the conclusion that the shadowing performance of strong equicontinuity and pseudo-shadowing property implies limit shadowing is also obtained. Furthermore, the shadowing property of non-autonomous product space is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent localized patterns in a predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical continuation is used to compute solution branches in a two-component reaction-diffusion model of Leslie--Gower type. %in the vicinity of a Turing-Hopf interaction. Two regimes are studied in detail. In the first, the homogeneous state loses stability to supercritical spatially uniform oscillations, followed by a subcritical steady state bifurcation of Turing type. The latter leads to spatially localized states embedded in an oscillating background that bifurcate from snaking branches of localized steady states. Using two-parameter continuation we uncover a novel mechanism whereby disconnected segments of oscillatory states zip up into a continuous snaking branch of time-periodic localized states, some of which are stable. In the second, the homogeneous state loses stability to supercritical Turing patterns, but steady spatially localized states embedded either in the homogeneous state or in a small amplitude Turing state are nevertheless present. We show that such behavior is possible when sideband Turing states are strongly subcritical and explain why this is so in the present model. In both cases the observed behavior differs significantly from that expected on the basis of a supercritical primary bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation and Phase Patterns in Symmetric Ring Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of ODEs coupled with the topology of a closed ring are common models in biology, robotics, electrical engineering, and many other areas of science. When the component systems and couplings are identical, the system has a cyclic symmetry group for unidirectional rings and a dihedral symmetry group for bidirectional rings. Hopf bifurcation in equivariant and network dynamics predicts the generic occurrence of periodic discrete rotating waves whose phase patterns are determined by the symmetry group. We review basic aspects of the theory in some detail and derive general properties of such rings. New results are obtained characterising the first bifurcation for long-range couplings and the direction in which discrete rotating wave states rotate.</description>

      <title>Blender-producing mechanisms and a dichotomy for local dynamics for heterodimensional cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blenders are special hyperbolic sets used to produce various robust dynamical phenomena which appear fragile at first glance. We prove for $C^r$ diffeomorphisms ($r=2,\dots,\infty,\omega$) that blenders naturally exist (without perturbation) near non-degenerate heterodimensional cycles of coindex-1, and the existence is determined by arithmetic properties of moduli of topological conjugacy for diffeomorphisms with heterodimensional cycles. In particular, we obtain a $C^r$-generic dichotomy for dynamics in any small neighborhood $U$ of a non-degenerate heterodimensional cycle: either there exist infinitely many blenders accumulating on the cycle, forming robust heterodimensional dynamics in most cases, or there are no orbits other than those constituting the cycle lying entirely in $U$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaker governs synchrony patterns in neuronal inspired networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments in the human brain reveal switching between different activity patterns and functional network organization over time. Recently, multilayer modeling has been employed across multiple neurobiological levels (from spiking networks to brain regions) to unveil novel insights into the emergence and time evolution of synchrony patterns. We consider two layers with the top layer directly coupled to the bottom layer. When isolated, the bottom layer would remain in a specific stable pattern. However, in the presence of the top layer, the network exhibits spatiotemporal switching. The top layer in combination with the inter-layer coupling acts as a symmetry breaker, governing the bottom layer and restricting the number of allowed symmetry-induced patterns. This structure allows us to demonstrate the existence and stability of pattern states on the bottom layer, but most remarkably, it enables a simple mechanism for switching between patterns based on the unique symmetry-breaking role of the governing layer. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaker prevents complete synchronization in the bottom layer, a situation that would not be desirable in a normal functioning brain. We illustrate our findings using two layers of Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) oscillators, employing the Master Stability function approach in small networks to investigate the switching between patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to obtain Berry--Esseen type error bounds in the multivariate central limit theorem for non-stationary processes generated by time-dependent compositions of uniformly expanding dynamical systems. In a particular case of random dynamical systems with a strongly mixing base transformation, we derive an error estimate of order $O(N^{-1/2})$ in the quenched multivariate CLT, provided that the covariance matrix \say{grows linearly} with the number of summands $N$. The error in the normal approximation is estimated for the class of all convex sets.</description>

      <title>Unfolding numbers for interval maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new invariant (\emph{rotation number}) for a \emph{cycle} of an \emph{interval map}, called its \emph{unfolding number} to circumvent some difficulties faced in the \emph{over-rotation theory} for \emph{interval maps}. We corroborate the \emph{completeness} of the theory and exhibit that the set of \emph{unfolding numbers} of points under a given interval map $f$ forms an \emph{interval} of the form $[u_f, \frac{1}{2}]$ where $u_f$ can be \emph{computed} by a simple \emph{algorithm} for any \emph{interval} map $f$. Further, $u_f$ is realized on a \emph{closed invariant} subset $Z_f \subset [0,1]$ such that $f|_{Z_f}$ is \emph{strictly ergodic}. In the end we forge connection between \emph{unfolding numbers} and \emph{over-rotation numbers}: we reveal that while disparate in essence, there exists \emph{special patterns} $\pi_s$ called \emph{sheer patterns} for whom \emph{unfolding numbers} equals \emph{over-rotation numbers}.</description>

      <title>On divergent on average trajectories for higher rank actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $d\ge 3$ we first show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $A$-divergent on average points in the $(d-1)$-dimensional closed horosphere in the space of $d$-dimensional Euclidean lattices, where $A$ is the group of positive diagonal matrices, is at most $\frac{d-1}{2}$. In particular, this upper bound is sharp for $d=3$.
  We apply this to compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of exceptions to the inhomogeneous uniform version of Littlewood conjecture. We say that a pair $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfies the inhomogeneous Littlewood conjecture if $$\liminf_{q\to\infty}q\|q\xi_1-\theta_1\|_{\mathbb{Z}}\|q\xi_2-\theta_2\|_{\mathbb{Z}}=0$$ for all $(\theta_1,\theta_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\|\cdot\|_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the distance to the nearest integer. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of pairs $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ not satisfying the inhomogeneous Littlewood conjecture is $1$, which is equal to the Hausdorff dimension of the conjectural set of exceptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the moments of the Margulis $\alpha$-function integrating over expanding translates of a unipotent orbit in $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$. We show that for some $\lambda&gt;1$ the $\lambda$-moments of the Margulis $\alpha$-function over expanding translates of a unipotent orbit are uniformly bounded, under suitable Diophantine conditions of the initial unipotent orbit.
  As an application, we prove that for any indefinite irrational ternary quadratic form $Q$ with suitable Diophantine conditions and $a&lt;b$ the number of integral vectors of norm at most $T$ satisfying $a&lt;Q(v)&lt;b$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\mathsf{C}_Q(b-a)T$ as $T$ tends to infinity, where the constant $\mathsf{C}_Q&gt;0$ depends only on $Q$.</description>

Abstract: This article presents an innovative approach to integrating port-Hamiltonian systems with neural network architectures, transitioning from deterministic to stochastic models. The study presents novel mathematical formulations and computational models that extend the understanding of dynamical systems under uncertainty and complex interactions. It emphasizes the significant progress in learning and predicting the dynamics of non-autonomous systems using port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs). It also explores the implications of stochastic neural networks in various dynamical systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have demonstrated that the controllers designed by a classical motion planning tool, namely artificial potential fields (APFs), can be derived from a recently prevalent approach: control barrier function quadratic program (CBF-QP) safety filters. By integrating APF information into the CBF-QP framework, we establish a bridge between these two methodologies. Specifically, this is achieved by employing the attractive potential field as a control Lyapunov function (CLF) to guide the design of the nominal controller, and then the repulsive potential field serves as a reciprocal CBF (RCBF) to define a CBF-QP safety filter. Building on this integration, we extend the design of the CBF-QP safety filter to accommodate a more general class of dynamical models featuring a control-affine structure. This extension yields a special CBF-QP safety filter and a general APF solution suitable for control-affine dynamical models. Through a reach-avoid navigation example, we showcase the efficacy of the developed approaches.</description>

      <title>Balancing art and money in pursuit of a Kelly-type optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a mathematical model of an art collector. In our model, the collector is a rational agent whose actions in the art market are driven by two competing long-term objectives, namely sustainable financial health and maintaining the collection. Mathematically, our model is a two-dimensional random linear dynamical system with transformation matrix of a peculiar type. In some examples we are able to show that within the Kelly-type optimization paradigm, that is optimizing the system's Lyapunov exponent over a set of policy parameters, the dilemma ``art or money" can be successfully resolved, namely the optimal policy creates a coexistence equilibrium where the value of both is increasing over the time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ with bounded random but not necessarily identically distributed values of the potential. We prove spectral localization (with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions) as well as dynamical localization for this model. An important ingredient of the proof is a non-stationary version of the parametric Furstenberg Theorem on random matrix products, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide deterministic controllability conditions that imply exponential mixing properties for randomly forced constrained dynamical systems with possibly unbounded state space. As an application, new ergodicity results are obtained for non-smooth models in elasto-plasticity driven by various types of noise, including white noise. It is thereby illustrated how tools from control theory can be utilized to tackle regularity issues that commonly arise in the qualitative study of constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of continuous-time neural networks for linear dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering a suitable neural network architecture for modeling complex dynamical systems poses a formidable challenge, often involving extensive trial and error and navigation through a high-dimensional hyper-parameter space. In this paper, we discuss a systematic approach to constructing neural architectures for modeling a subclass of dynamical systems, namely, Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. We use a variant of continuous-time neural networks in which the output of each neuron evolves continuously as a solution of a first-order or second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Instead of deriving the network architecture and parameters from data, we propose a gradient-free algorithm to compute sparse architecture and network parameters directly from the given LTI system, leveraging its properties. We bring forth a novel neural architecture paradigm featuring horizontal hidden layers and provide insights into why employing conventional neural architectures with vertical hidden layers may not be favorable. We also provide an upper bound on the numerical errors of our neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of our constructed networks on three numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Low Rank Groupwise Deformations for Motion Tracking in Cardiac Cine MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphic image registration is a commonly used method to deform one image to resemble another. While warping a single image to another is useful, it can be advantageous to warp multiple images simultaneously, such as in tracking the motion of the heart across a sequence of images. In this paper, our objective is to propose a novel method capable of registering a group or sequence of images to a target image, resulting in registered images that appear identical and therefore have a low rank. Moreover, we aim for these registered images to closely resemble the target image. Through experimental evidence, we will demonstrate our method's superior efficacy in producing low-rank groupwise deformations compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

Abstract: The paper is concerned with maximal subgroups of the ample (better known as topological full) groups of homeomorphisms of totally disconnected compact metrizable topological spaces. We describe all maximal subgroups that are stabilizers of finite sets. Under certain assumptions on the ample group (including minimality), we describe all maximal subgroups that are stabilizers of closed sets or stabilizers of partitions into clopen sets. In particular, our results apply to the ample groups associated with Cantor minimal systems.</description>

      <title>Gap distribution of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ and the circle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the properly renormalized gaps of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ with $n &lt; N$ converges (when $N\rightarrow \infty$) to a non-standard limit distribution, as Elkies and McMullen proved in 2004 using techniques from homogeneous dynamics. In this paper we give an essentially self-contained proof based on the circle method. Our main innovation consists in showing that a new type of correlation functions of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ converge. To define these correlation functions we restrict, smoothly, to those $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ that lie in minor arcs, i.e. away from rational numbers with small denominators.</description>

Abstract: A heterodimensional cycle is an invariant set of a dynamical system consisting of two hyperbolic periodic orbits with different dimensions of their unstable manifolds and a pair of orbits that connect them. For systems which are at least $C^2$, we show that bifurcations of a coindex-1 heterodimensional cycle within a generic 2-parameter family create robust heterodimensional dynamics, i.e., a pair of non-trivial hyperbolic basic sets with different numbers of positive Lyapunov exponents, such that the unstable manifold of each of the sets intersects the stable manifold of the second set and these intersections persist for an open set of parameter values. We also give a solution to the so-called local stabilization problem of coindex-1 heterodimensional cycles in any regularity class $r=2,\ldots,\infty,\omega$. The results are based on the observation that arithmetic properties of moduli of topological conjugacy of systems with heterodimensional cycles determine the emergence of Bonatti-D\'iaz blenders.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classical framework developed by Brin, Pesin and others to study ergodicity and mixing properties of isometric extensions of volume-preserving Anosov flows, using the microlocal framework developed in the theory of Pollicott-Ruelle resonances. The approach developed in the present note is reinvested in the companion paper [arXiv:2111.14811] in order to show ergodicity of the frame flow on negatively-curved Riemannian manifolds under nearly $1/4$-pinched curvature assumption (resp. nearly $1/2$-pinched) in dimension $4$ and $4\ell+2, \ell &gt; 0$ (resp. dimension $4\ell, \ell &gt; 0$).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that finite-dimensional topological flows without fixed points and having a countable number of periodic orbits, have the small flow boundary property. This enables us to answer positively a question of Bowen and Walters from 1972: Any expansive topological flow has a strongly isomorphic symbolic flow extension, i.e. an extension by a suspension flow over a subshift. Previously Burguet had shown this is true if the flow is assumed to be $C^2$-smooth.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of Locally Compact Groups, Symbolic Dynamics and the Scale Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown how to model any automorphism of a totally disconnected, locally compact group by a symbolic dynamical system. The model is an inverse limit of a product of a full-shift, on a finite number of symbols, with one of two types of systems. One is a countable discrete space with a permutation having every point periodic and the other is an essentially wandering, countable state Markov shift. Some of the ideas used are from dynamics and some from the study of totally disconnected, locally compact groups. The later ideas concern the scale function and tidy subgroups. There is a discussion of the connections between those ideas and the dynamical ideas. It is seen that only the essentially wandering, countable state Markov shift affects the scale function. Finally, it's shown that transitivity or ergodicity with respect to Haar measure implies that the system has no countable discrete or essentially wandering component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses time embedding and Mahalanobis scaling to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The time embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis scaling, applied to kernel or random Fourier features, adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We find that the Mahalanobis scaling from FKMD can be used for effective dimensionality reduction of alanine dipeptide data. We also show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

Our results concern a more general class of decoupled measures on shift spaces over a finite alphabet and in particular imply strong asymptotic consistency of the modified estimator for all pairs of functions of stationary, irreducible, finite-state Markov chains satisfying a mild decay condition. Our approach is based on the study of a rescaled cumulant-generating function called the cross-entropic pressure, importing to information theory some techniques from the study of large deviations within the thermodynamic formalism.</description>

Abstract: We discuss questions by Mostow \cite{Mo1}, Bers \cite{B} and Krushkal \cite{Kr1, Kr2} about uniqueness of a conformal or spherical CR structure on the sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ of symmetric rank one space $H_\mathbb{F}^n$ over division algebra $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}\,,\mathbb{C}\,,\mathbb{H}\,,\text{or}\,\, \mathbb{O} $ compatible with the action of a discrete group $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$. Introducing a nilpotent Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet with a positive Lebesgue measure in the nilpotent geometry in $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n\setminus\{\infty\}$ and its stretching, we construct a non-rigid discrete $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic groups $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$ whose non-trivial deformations are induced by $G$-equivariant homeomorphisms of the space. Here we consider two situations: either the limit set $\Lambda(G)$ is the whole sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ or restrictions of such non-trivial deformations to components of the discontinuity set $\Omega(G)\subset \partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ are given by restrictions of $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic isometries. In both cases the demonstrated non-rigidity is related to non-ergodic dynamics of the discrete group action on the limit set which could be the whole sphere at infinity.</description>

      <title>Iterated Monodromy Group With Non-Martingale Fixed-Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct families of rational functions $f: \mathbb{P}^1_k \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_k$ of degree $d \geq 2$ over a perfect field $k$ with non-martingale fixed-point processes. Then for any normal variety $X$ over $\mathbb{P}_{\bar{k}}^N$, we give conditions on $f: X \rightarrow X$ to guarantee that the associated fixed-point process is a martingale. This work extends the previous work of Bridy, Jones, Kelsey, and Lodge on martingale conditions and answers their question on the existence of a non-martingale fixed-point process associated with the iterated monodromy group of a rational function.</description>
