      <title>Expressive Power of Graph Transformers via Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO), GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for floats).</description>

      <title>Relative Completeness of Incorrectness Separation Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorrectness Separation Logic (ISL) is a proof system that is tailored specifically to resolve problems of under-approximation in programs that manipulate heaps, and it primarily focuses on bug detection. This approach is different from the over-approximation methods that are used in traditional logics such as Hoare Logic or Separation Logic. Although the soundness of ISL has been established, its completeness remains unproven. In this study, we establish relative completeness by leveraging the expressiveness of the weakest postconditions; expressiveness is a factor that is critical to demonstrating relative completeness in Reverse Hoare Logic. In our ISL framework, we allow for infinite disjunctions in disjunctive normal forms, where each clause comprises finite symbolic heaps with existential quantifiers. To compute the weakest postconditions in ISL, we introduce a canonicalization that includes variable aliasing.</description>

      <title>Causality and Decision-making: A Logical Framework for Systems and Security Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal reasoning is essential for understanding decision-making about the behaviour of complex `ecosystems' of systems that underpin modern society, with security -- including issues around correctness, safety, resilience, etc. -- typically providing critical examples. We present a theory of strategic reasoning about system modelling based on minimal structural assumptions and employing the methods of transition systems, supported by a modal logic of system states in the tradition of van Benthem, Hennessy, and Milner, and validated through equivalence theorems. Our framework introduces an intervention operator and a separating conjunction to capture actual causal relationships between component systems of the ecosystem, aligning naturally with Halpern and Pearl's counterfactual approach based on Structural Causal Models. We illustrate the applicability through examples of of decision-making about microservices in distributed systems. We discuss localized decision-making through a separating conjunction. This work unifies a formal, minimalistic notion of system behaviour with a Halpern--Pearl-compatible theory of counterfactual reasoning, providing a logical foundation for studying decision making about causality in complex interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Separation Logic of Generic Resources via Sheafeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separation logic was conceived in order to make the verification of pointer programs scalable to large systems and it has proven extremely effective. The key idea is that programs typically access only small parts of memory, allowing for local reasoning. This idea is implemented in separation logic by extending first-order logic with separating connectives, which inspect local regions of memory. It turns that this approach not only applies to pointer programs, but also to programs involving other resource structures. Various theories have been put forward to extract and apply the ideas of separation logic more broadly. This resulted in algebraic abstractions of memory and many variants of separation logic for, e.g., concurrent programs and stochastic processes. However, none of the existing approaches formulate the combination of first-order logic with separating connectives in a theory that could immediately yield program logics for different resources. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the idea that separation logic can obtained by making first-order logic resource-aware. First-order logic can be understood in terms of categorical logic, specifically fibrations. Our contribution is to make these resource-aware by developing categorical logic internally in categories of sheaves, which is what we call sheafeology. The role of sheaves is to model views on resources, through which resources can be localised and combined, which enables the scalability promised by separation logic. We contribute constructions of an internal fibration in sheaf categories that models predicates on resources, and that admits first-order and separating connectives. Thereby, we attain a general framework of separation logic for generic resources, a claim we substantiate by instantiating our framework to various memory models and random variables.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Hyperproperties over Observed and Constructed Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring at runtime whether a system fulfills a specification defined by a hyperproperty, such as linearizability or variants of non-interference. For this purpose, we introduce specifications with both passive and active quantification over traces. While passive trace quantifiers range over the traces that are observed, active trace quantifiers are instantiated with \emph{generator functions}, which are part of the specification. Generator functions enable the monitor to construct traces that may never be observed at runtime, such as the linearizations of a concurrent trace. As specification language, we extend hypernode logic with trace quantifiers over generator functions and interpret these hypernode formulas over possibly infinite domains. We present a corresponding monitoring algorithm, which we implemented and evaluated on a range of hyperproperties for concurrency and security applications. Our method enables, for the first time, the monitoring of asynchronous hyperproperties that contain alternating trace quantifiers.</description>

      <title>A Myhill-Nerode Theorem for Generalized Automata, with Applications to Pattern Matching and Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06506v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of generalized automata, introduced by Eilenberg in 1974, allows representing a regular language more concisely than conventional automata by allowing edges to be labeled not only with characters, but also strings. Giammaresi and Montalbano introduced a notion of determinism for generalized automata [STACS 1995]. While generalized deterministic automata retain many properties of conventional deterministic automata, the uniqueness of a minimal generalized deterministic automaton is lost.
  In the first part of the paper, we show that the lack of uniqueness can be explained by introducing a set $ \mathcal{W(A)} $ associated with a generalized automaton $ \mathcal{A} $. By fixing $ \mathcal{W(A)} $, we are able to derive for the first time a full Myhill-Nerode theorem for generalized automata, which contains the textbook Myhill-Nerode theorem for conventional automata as a degenerate case.
  In the second part of the paper, we show that the set $ \mathcal{W(A)} $ leads to applications for pattern matching and data compression. Wheeler automata [TCS 2017, SODA 2020] are a popular class of automata that can be compactly stored using $ e \log \sigma (1 + o(1)) + O(e) $ bits ($ e $ being the number of edges, $ \sigma $ being the size of the alphabet) in such a way that pattern matching queries can be solved in $ \tilde{O}(m) $ time ($ m $ being the length of the pattern). In the paper, we show how to extend these results to generalized automata. More precisely, a Wheeler generalized automata can be stored using $ \mathfrak{e} \log \sigma (1 + o(1)) + O(e + rn) $ bits so that pattern matching queries can be solved in $ \tilde{O}(r m) $ time, where $ \mathfrak{e} $ is the total length of all edge labels, $ r $ is the maximum length of an edge label and $ n $ is the number of states.</description>

      <title>A Formal Framework for the Definition of 'State': Hierarchical Representation and Meta-Universe Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of 'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a 'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers (ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration, introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we formulate the Positivity Problem for nearly linear
  recurrent sequences. This is a generalisation of the Positivity
  Problem for linear recurrence sequences and is a special case of the
  non-reachability problem for linear time-invariant systems. Our main
  contribution is a decision procedure for the Positivity Problem for
  nearly linear recurrences of order at most 3 whose characteristic
  roots have absolute value at most one. The decision procedure
  relies on a new transcendence result for infinite series that is of
  independent interest.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Systems as Structured Processes: Foundations, Failures, and Formal Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems, intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains. We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena, explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.</description>

      <title>PFL: a Probabilistic Logic for Fault Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety-critical infrastructures must operate in a safe and reliable way. Fault tree analysis is a widespread method used for risk assessment of these systems: fault trees (FTs) are required by, e.g., the Federal Aviation Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In spite of their popularity, little work has been done on formulating structural queries about FT and analyzing these, e.g., when evaluating potential scenarios, and to give practitioners instruments to formulate queries on FTs in an understandable yet powerful way. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by extending BFL [32], a logic that reasons about Boolean FTs. To do so, we introduce a Probabilistic Fault tree Logic (PFL). PFL is a simple, yet expressive logic that supports easier formulation of complex scenarios and specification of FT properties that comprise probabilities. Alongside PFL, we present LangPFL, a domain specific language to further ease property specification. We showcase PFL and LangPFL by applying them to a COVID-19 related FT and to a FT for an oil/gas pipeline. Finally, we present theory and model checking algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs).</description>

      <title>Generalized Parameter Lifting: Finer Abstractions for Parametric Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMCs) are Markov chains (MCs) with symbolic probabilities. A pMC encodes a family of MCs, where each member is obtained by replacing parameters with constants. The parameters allow encoding dependencies between transitions, which sets pMCs apart from interval MCs. The verification problem for pMCs asks whether each MC in the corresponding family satisfies a given temporal specification. The state-of-the-art approach for this problem is parameter lifting (PL) -- an abstraction-refinement loop that abstracts the pMC to a non-parametric model analyzed with standard probabilistic model checking techniques. This paper presents two key improvements to tackle the main limitations of PL. First, we introduce generalized parameter lifting (GPL) to lift various restrictive assumptions made by PL. Second, we present a big-step transformation algorithm that reduces parameter dependencies in pMCs and, therefore, results in tighter approximations. Experiments show that GPL is widely applicable and that the big-step transformation accelerates pMC verification by up to orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2405.10094 (also published at LICS'24 conference), the authors answer the question of the decidability of quasi-dense modal logics, and give an upper bound in EXPSPACE. Unfortunately, their proof is erroneous, leaving the question wide open. In this paper we provide a quite direct proof of their decidability by introducing a new variant of the well-know filtration method based on paths in a canonical model and prove that satisfiability is in NEXPTIME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the problem of explaining observations in contexts involving statements with truth degrees such as `the lift is loaded', `the symptoms are severe', etc. To formalise these contexts, we consider infinitely-valued {\L}ukasiewicz fuzzy logic. We define and motivate the notions of abduction problems and explanations in the language of {\L}ukasiewicz logic expanded with `interval literals' of the form $p\geq\mathbf{c}$, $p\leq\mathbf{c}$, and their negations that express the set of values a variable can have. We analyse the complexity of standard abductive reasoning tasks (solution recognition, solution existence, and relevance / necessity of hypotheses) in {\L}ukasiewicz logic for the case of the full language and for the case of theories containing only disjunctive clauses and show that in contrast to classical propositional logic, the abduction in the clausal fragment has lower complexity than in the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a category of probability spaces and measure-preserving Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. This category contains, among its isomorphisms, mod-zero isomorphisms of probability spaces. It also gives an isomorphism between the space of values of a random variable and the sigma-algebra that it generates on the outcome space, reflecting the standard mathematical practice of using the two interchangeably, for example when taking conditional expectations.
  We show that a number of constructions and results from classical probability theory, mostly involving notions of equilibrium, can be expressed and proven in terms of this category. In particular: - Given a stochastic dynamical system acting on a standard Borel space, we show that the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra can be obtained as a limit and as a colimit; - In the setting above, the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra gives rise, up to isomorphism of our category, to a standard Borel space; - As a corollary, we give a categorical version of the ergodic decomposition theorem for stochastic actions; - As an example, we show how de Finetti's theorem and the Hewitt-Savage and Kolmogorov zero-one laws fit in this limit-colimit picture.
  This work uses the tools of categorical probability, in particular Markov categories, as well as the theory of dagger categories.</description>

      <title>MacroSwarm: A Field-based Compositional Framework for Swarm Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10969v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.</description>

      <title>On the Counting Complexity of the Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks, given an integer linear recurrence sequence (LRS), to determine whether the sequence contains a zero term or not. Its decidability is a longstanding open problem in theoretical computer science and automata theory. Currently, decidability is only known for LRS of order at most 4. On the other hand, the sole known complexity result is NP-hardness, due to Blondel and Portier.
  A fundamental result in this area is the celebrated Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem, which asserts that the zero set of any LRS is the union of a finite set and finitely many arithmetic progressions. This paper focuses on a computational perspective of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem: we show that the problem of counting the zeros of a given LRS is #P-hard, and in fact #P-complete for the instances generated in our reduction.</description>

      <title>Modeling Deontic Modal Logic in the s(CASP) Goal-directed Predicate Answer Set Programming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how (deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation (negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming (ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being elegantly resolved.</description>
