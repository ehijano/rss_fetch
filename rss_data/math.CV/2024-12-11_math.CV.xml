      <title>Fractal zeta functions at infinity and the $\phi$-shell Minkowski content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of unbounded domains with infinite Lebesgue measure via their complex fractal dimensions. These complex dimensions are defined as poles of a suitable defined Lapidus fractal zeta function at infinity and are a generalization of the Minkowski dimension for a special kind of a degenerated relative fractal drum at infinity. It is a natural generalization of a similar approach applied to unbounded domains of finite Lebesgue measures investigated previously by the author. In this case we adapt the definition of Minkowski content and dimension at infinity by introducing the so-called $\phi$-shells where $\phi$ is a real parameter. We show that the new notion of the upper $\phi$-shell Minkowski dimension is independent on the paramter $\phi$ and well adapted to the fractal zeta function at infinity. We also study how the new definition connects with the one-point compactification and the classical fractal properties of the corresponding compactified domain. We also give a construction of maximally hyperfractal and of quasperiodic domains at infinity of infinite Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Transcendental Minimal Model Program for Projective Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove that if $(X,B+\beta)$ is a projective generalized klt pair such that $B+\beta$ is big, then $(X,B+\beta)$ admits a good Minimal Model or Mori fiber space. In particular, this implies Tossati's transcendental base-point-free conjecture for projective manifolds.</description>

      <title>Relationship between the zeros of a polynomial and its critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F(z)=\prod\limits_{k=1}^n(z-z_k)$ be a monic complex polynomial of degree $n$. In 1998, Pawlowski [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 350 (1998)] studied the radius $\gamma_n$ of the smallest concentric disk with center at $\tfrac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^nz_k}{n}$ contained at least one critical point of $F(z)$. He showed that $\gamma_n\le \tfrac{2n^\frac{1}{n-1}}{n^\frac{2}{n-1}+1}$. In this paper, we refine Pawlowski's result in the spirit of Borcea variance conjectures and classic Schoenberg inequality, specifically, we show that $\gamma_n\le\sqrt{\tfrac{n-2}{n-1}}$ in a very concise manner. Moreover, we obtain various generalizations of Schoenberg inequalities based on classic Schoenberg inequality including refining Lin-Xie-Zhang's result [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 502 (2021)], which is inspired by the author's recent work on Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities [arXiv:2410.21961] . Finally, we make $D$-companion matrix introduced by Cheung-Ng [Linear Algebra Appl. 432 (2010)] and operator inequalities involved Schatten $p$-norm react so that we provide an additional relationship between the zeros of $F(z)$ and its critical points in the case where all $z_k\ge 0$, which can be regarded as complements of Schmeisser's result [Comput. Methods Funct. Theory 3 (2003)]. By an operator 2-norm identity, we also prove Sendov conjecture with a condition that depends only on $\left( \tfrac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}\left|z_k-z_n\right|^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity in the dynamics of holomorphic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies ergodic properties of certain measures arising in the dynamics of holomorphic correspondences. These measures, in general, are not invariant in the classical sense of ergodic theory. We define a notion of ergodicity, and prove a version of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem in this setting. We also show the existence of ergodic measures when a holomorphic correspondence is defined on a compact complex manifold. Lastly, we give an explicit class of dynamically interesting measures that are ergodic as in our definition.</description>

      <title>Commutation relations for two-sided radial SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the commutation relation for 2-radial SLE in the unit disc starting from two boundary points. We follow the framework introduced by Dub\'{e}dat. Under an additional requirement of the interchangeability of the two curves, we classify all locally commuting 2-radial SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (0,8)$: it is either a two-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with spiral of constant spiraling rate or a chordal SLE$_\kappa$ weighted by a power of the conformal radius of its complement. Namely, for fixed $\kappa$ and starting points, we have exactly two one-parameter continuous families of locally commuting 2-radial SLE. Two-sided radial SLE with spiral is a generalization of two-sided radial SLE (without spiral) and satisfies the resampling property. We also discuss the semiclassical limit of the commutation relation as $\kappa \to 0$. In particular, we show that the limit for the second family with an appropriately chosen power of conformal radius is a chord that minimizes a modified chordal Loewner energy, which is unique only when the endpoints are not antipodal.</description>

      <title>Constructive solution of Zariski's Moduli Problem for Plane Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an explicit solution to Zariski's moduli problem for plane branches. We compute (in an algorithmic way) the set of K\"{a}hler differentials of an irreducible germ of holomorphic plane curve. We show that there is a basis of this set whose main elements correspond to dicritical foliations. Indeed, we discuss several concepts of generation for the semimodule of values of K\"{a}hler differentials of the curve and provide basis of K\"{a}hler differentials, for every of these concepts, whose geometric properties are described. Moreover, we give an algorithmic construction of the bases.</description>

      <title>$SLE_6$ and 2-d critical bond percolation on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>
