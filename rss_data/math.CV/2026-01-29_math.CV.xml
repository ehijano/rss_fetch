      <title>A Canonical Characterization of Normal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize normal families in the unit ball as those families of analytic functions whose restrictions to each complex line through the origin are normal. We then generalize this result to a characterization of normal functions according to behavior on analytic discs. A simple proof of an old theorem of Hartog's that a formal power series at 0 in $\Cn$ is convergent if its restriction to each complex line through the origin is convergent are given.</description>

      <title>Angle duality and a gap principle for convex combinations of incomplete polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an angle duality and a gap principle for convex combinations of incomplete polynomials, extending two results of Ge and Gonek in [IMRN, 2024].Our approach is geometric: we introduce an ``angle gain'' mechanism for points inside the lune region and quantify how moving away from the unit circle forces a definite increase in the relevant angle functional.This yields a robust lower bound that is uniform under convex mixing and leads to the desired separation phenomenon.The main difficulty is that incomplete polynomials and their convex combinations may have highly nonuniform root distributions on the unit circle, so classical convex-hull type constraints are too coarse; one must instead control the local geometry of chords and boundary arcs and relate it to critical-point behavior through sharp trigonometric inequalities.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the Berger--Coburn conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berger and Coburn proposed an endpoint boundedness criterion for Toeplitz operators on the Bargmann--Fock space in which the decisive quantity is the heat transform of the symbol at the borderline time $t=\tfrac14$, the time naturally singled out by the Weyl calculus under the Bargmann transform. We show that this criterion fails for general measurable symbols in every complex dimension $n\ge 1$. Concretely, we construct a measurable symbol $g\in L^2(\mathbb C^n,d\mu)$ such that $gk_a\in L^2(d\mu)$ for every normalized reproducing kernel $k_a$, and the associated Toeplitz form extends to a bounded operator on $H^2(\mathbb C^n,d\mu)$, but the heat transform $g^{(1/4)}$ is unbounded on $\mathbb C^n$. The example is obtained by summing translated bounded "blocks" whose Toeplitz norms are summable while their $t=\tfrac14$ heat profiles have fixed size. The blocks are produced by combining a Hilbert--Schmidt estimate for Weyl quantization with the Bargmann correspondence between Weyl and Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>Versal deformation of transversely holomorphic flows on the boundary of strongly convex domains of $\mathbb C^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give a versal deformation for any transversely holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}_0$ given by the intersection of the orbits of a holomorphic vector field $\xi$ defined on a neighborhood of the closure of a bounded strongly convex open domain $\Omega \subset\mathbb C^n$ ($n\geq2$) with smooth boundary, with its boundary $\partial \Omega$. That is, any germ of deformation of $\mathcal{F}_0$ is also obtained by intersecting the orbits of a deformation of $\xi$ with the boundary of $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions (basins/neighbourhoods of equilibria) in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for topological and geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors:
  First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time.
  Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in ["The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows", K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions.
  Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>
