      <title>Laser-driven bunch compression for ultrashort free-electron laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of ultrashort X-ray pulses in a free-electron laser relies on high-density electron bunches with a precisely adjusted current and energy distribution. To this end, robust and flexible electron bunch manipulation techniques are required that allow a high degree of control over the phase space density of the bunch. This paper reports on the demonstration of ultrashort current spikes with femtosecond duration, created by compressing an electron bunch after a laser-induced energy modulation with linearly varying envelope. This scheme is implemented at the free-electron laser FLASH, where the energy modulation is created early in the linear accelerator before the bunch is accelerated to its final energy. Formation of the spikes is observed in measurements of the longitudinal phase space density. It is demonstrated that, in conjunction with conventional compression techniques, this laser-based scheme allows to create two spikes with variable temporal separation. Therefore, the demonstrated compression scheme shows great potential of enabling flexible ultrashort single- and double-pulse operation modes of free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Deployment and validation of predictive 6-dimensional beam diagnostics through generative reconstruction with standard accelerator elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the 6-dimensional phase space distribution of particle beams is essential for optimizing accelerator performance. Conventional diagnostics such as use of transverse deflecting cavities offer detailed characterization but require dedicated hardware and space. Generative phase space reconstruction (GPSR) methods have shown promise in beam diagnostics, yet prior implementations still rely on such components. Here we present the first experimental implementation and validation of the GPSR methodology, realized by the use of standard accelerator elements including accelerating cavities and dipole magnets, to achieve complete 6-dimensional phase space reconstruction. Through simulations and experiments at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free Electron Laser facility, we successfully reconstruct complex, nonlinear beam structures. Furthermore, we validate the methodology by predicting independent downstream measurements excluded from training, revealing near-unique reconstruction closely resembling ground truth. This advancement establishes a pathway for predictive diagnostics across beamline segments while reducing hardware requirements and expanding applicability to various accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>To the theoretical description of the losses in inductance coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.04884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article discusses a theory that allows to describe losses in conductors taking into account the skin effect and the proximity effect. The developed theory is applied to inductance coils. In contrast to the classical Butterworth theory the condition of the strong skin effect, which is frequent in practice, is introduced from the very beginning. This approach makes possible to obtain extremely simple formulas, which show that Q-factor of a coil is determined mainly by the diameter of its winding.</description>
