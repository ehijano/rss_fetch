      <title>Absoluteness of the Riemann integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the concept of absoluteness in the context of mathematical analysis, focusing specifically on the Riemann integral on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In mathematical logic, "absoluteness" refers to the invariance of the truth value of certain statements in different mathematical universes. Leveraging this idea, we investigate the conditions under which the Riemann integral on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ remains absolute between transitive models of ZFC, the standard axiomatic system in which current mathematics is usually formalized. To this end, we develop a framework for integration on Boolean algebras with respect to finitely additive measures and show that the classical Riemann integral is a particular case of this generalized approach. Our main result establishes that the Riemann integral over rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is absolute in the following sense: if $M \subseteq N$ are transitive models of ZFC, $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \cap M$, and $f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is a bounded function in $M$, then $f$ is Riemann integrable in $M$ if, and only if, in $N$ there exists some Riemann integrable function $g \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ extending $f$. In this case, the values of the integrals computed in each model are the same. Furthermore, the function $g$ is unique except for a measure zero set.</description>

      <title>Finitely additive measures on Boolean algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we conduct a detailed study of \emph{finitely additive measures} (fams) in the context of Boolean algebras, focusing on three specific topics: freeness and approximation, existence and extension criteria, and integration theory. In the first topic, we present a classification of \emph{free} finitely additive measures, that is, those for which the measure of finite sets is zero, in terms of approximation to uniform probability measures. This inspires a weaker version of this notion, which we call the \emph{uniform approximation property}, characterized in terms of freeness and another well-determined type of fams we call \emph{uniformly supported}. In the second topic, we study criteria for existence and extension of finitely additive measures for Boolean algebras, offering a relatively short proof of the \emph{compatibility theorem} for fams.
  Finally, we study a Riemann-type integration theory on fields of sets with respect to finitely additive measures, allowing us to extend and generalize some classical concepts and results from real analysis, such as Riemann integration over rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the Jordan measure. We also generalize the extension criteria for fams allowing desired values of integrals of a given set of functions. At the end, we explore the connection between integration in fields of sets and the Lebesgue integration in the Stone space of the corresponding field, where we establish a characterization of integrability in the sense of the Lebesgue-Vitali theorem, which follows as a consequence of our results.</description>

      <title>Ramsey's witnesses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Ramsey partition regularity, a generalisation of partition regularity involving infinitary configurations. We provide characterisations of this notion in terms of certain ultrafilters related to tensor products and dubbed Ramsey's witnesses; and we also consider their nonstandard counterparts as pairs of hypernatural numbers, called Ramsey pairs. These characterisations are then used to determine whether various configurations involving polynomials and exponentials are Ramsey partition regular over the natural numbers.</description>

      <title>Quasianalytic algebras with weakly smooth germs generate o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:1303.3724, the authors provide an axiomatic way of constructing new polynomially bounded o-minimal structures. However, all of the structures satisfying these axioms must also have smooth cell-decomposition. In this paper, we generalize their approach by allowing weakly smooth germs into the construction. In particular, we showed in arXiv:2501.17583 that the o-minimal structure constructed in [O. Le Gal, J.-P. Rolin. "An o-minimal structure which does not admit $C^\infty$ cellular decomposition" Ann. Inst. Fourier 59 (2009), pp 543-562] satisfies the assumptions of our theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short paper is a small contribution to the field of Boolean Contact Algebras. We analyze the non-definability of the property of internal connectedness, and we prove certain minimality conditions for algebras and spaces that can be used in demonstrating that the aforementioned property cannot be expressed by means of contact within regular closed algebras.</description>

      <title>Stratifiable formulae are not context-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10291v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stratified formulae were introduced by Quine as an alternative way to attack Russell's Paradox. Instead of limiting comprehension by size (as in $\mathsf{ZF}$ set theory, using its axiom scheme of separation), unlimited comprehension is given to formulae that are in some sense descended from formulae of typed set theory. By keeping variables in a stratified structure, the most common candidates for inconsistency such as $\{x\mid x\notin x\}$ are eliminated. Under the usual syntax of set theory, the set of stratified formulae form a formal language. We show that, unlike the full class of well-formed formulae of set theory, this language is not context-free, and extend the result to its complement. Therefore, much like the axioms of $\mathsf{PA}$ and $\mathsf{ZF}$ (under their usual axiomatizations), the theory $\mathsf{NF}$ as a formal language is not context-free. We then introduce a non-standard syntax of set theory and show that with this syntax there is a restricted class of formulae, the exo-stratified formulae, that is context-free and full (up to relabelling of variables).</description>

      <title>Axiomatizing modal inclusion logic and its variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete axiomatization of modal inclusion logic - team-based modal logic extended with inclusion atoms. We review and refine an expressive completeness and normal form theorem for the logic, define a natural deduction proof system, and use the normal form to prove completeness of the axiomatization. Complete axiomatizations are also provided for two other extensions of modal logic with the same expressive power as modal inclusion logic: one augmented with a might operator and the other with a single-world variant of the might operator.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free abelian groups are faithfully Borel complete and pure embeddability is a complete analytic quasi-order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [9] we proved that the space of countable torsion-free abelian groups is Borel complete. In this paper we show that our construction from [9] satisfies several additional properties of interest. We deduce from this that countable torsion-free abelian groups are faithfully Borel complete, in fact, more strongly, we can $\mathfrak{L}_{\omega_1, \omega}$-interpret countable graphs in them. Secondly, we show that the relation of pure embeddability (equiv., elementary embeddability) among countable models of $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}^{(\omega)})$ is a complete analytic quasi-order.</description>

      <title>Quantifier-free formulas and quantifier alternation depth in doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to incorporate the notion of quantifier-free formulas modulo a first-order theory and the stratification of formulas by quantifier alternation depth modulo a first-order theory into the algebraic treatment of classical first-order logic.
  The set of quantifier-free formulas modulo a theory is axiomatized by what we call a quantifier-free fragment of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Rather than being an intrinsic notion, a quantifier-free fragment is an additional structure on a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Under a smallness assumption, the structures occurring as quantifier-free fragments of some Boolean doctrine with quantifiers are precisely the Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers). In particular, every Boolean doctrine over a small category is a quantifier-free fragment of its quantifier completion.
  Furthermore, the sequences obtained by stratifying an algebra of formulas by quantifier alternation depth modulo a theory are axiomatized by what we call QA-stratified Boolean doctrines. While quantifier-free fragments are defined in relation to an "ambient" Boolean doctrine with quantifiers, a QA-stratified Boolean doctrine requires no such ambient doctrine, and it consists of a sequence of Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers) with connecting axioms. QA-stratified Boolean doctrines are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs consisting of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers and a quantifier-free fragment of it.</description>

Abstract: We consider the topological dynamics of the automorphism group of a particular sparse graph M_1 resulting from an ab initio Hrushovski construction. We show that minimal subflows of the flow of linear orders on M_1 have all orbits meagre, partially answering a question of Tsankov regarding results of Evans, Hubicka and Nesetril on the topological dynamics of automorphism groups of sparse graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the assumption of small violations of choice with seed $S$ ($\mathsf{SVC}(S)$), the failure of many choice principles reflect to to local properties of $S$, which can be a helpful characterisation for preservation proofs. We demonstrate the reflections of $\mathsf{DC}$, $\mathsf{AC}_\lambda$, $\mathsf{PP}$, and other important forms of choice. As a consequence, we show that if $S$ is infinite then $S$ can be partitioned into $\omega$ many non-empty subsets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove motivic versions of the Langlands-Shelstad Fundamental Lemma and Ng\^o's Geometric Stabilization. To achieve this, we follow the strategy from the recent proof by Groechenig, Wyss and Ziegler which avoided the use of perverse sheaves using instead $p$-adic integration and Tate duality. We make a key use of a construction of Denef and Loeser which assigns a virtual motive to any definable set in the theory of pseudo-finite fields.</description>
