      <title>On the order of Brauer classes capturing Brauer-Manin Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined over a number field $k$ that has Brauer-Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points. We study the orders of the Brauer classes which capture the obstruction. We prove that one may require elements of arbitrarily large order to capture the obstruction. In other words, the exponent of the group which captures the obstruction has no upper bound.</description>

      <title>Base change conductors through intersection theory and quotient singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the base change conductor for Jacobians. Through the lens of intersection theory and Deligne's Riemann-Roch theorem, we present novel computational approaches for both the tame and wild parts of the base change conductor. Our key results include a general formula of the tame part, as well as a computation of the wild part in terms of Galois quotients of semistable models of the curves. We treat in detail the case of potential good reduction when the quotient only has weak wild quotient singularities, relying on recent advances by Obus and Wewers.</description>

      <title>Rost injectivity for classical groups over function fields of curves over local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let F be a complete discretely valued field with residue field a global field or a local field with no real orderings. Let G be an absolutely simple simply connected group of outer type A_n. If 2 and the index of the underlying algebra of G are coprime to the characteristic of the residue field of F, then we prove that the Rost invariant map from the first Galois cohomology set of G to the degree three Galois cohomology group is injective. Let L be the function field of a curve over a local field K and G an absolutely simple simply connected linear algebraic group over L of classical type. Suppose that
  the characteristic of the residue field of K is a good prime for G. As a consequence of our result and some known results we conclude that the Rost invariant of G is injective.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kronecker fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few years ago Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko introduced an interesting quantization of the real numbers as certain power series in a quantization parameter $q.$ It is known now that the golden ratio has minimal radius among all these series. We study the rational numbers having maximal radius of convergence equal to 1, which we call Kronecker fractions. We prove that the corresponding continued fraction expansions must be palindromic and describe all Kronecker fractions with prime denominators. We found several infinite families of Kronecker fractions and all Kronecker fractions with denominator less than 2000. We also comment on the irrational case and on the relation with braids, rational knots and links.</description>

      <title>Higher local duality in Galois cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field $K$ is $d$-local if there exist fields $K=k_d,\dots,k_0$ with $k_{i+1}$ completely discretely valued with residue field $k_i$, and $k_0$ quasi-finite. We prove a duality theorem for the Galois cohomology of such $K$ with many coefficients, including finite coefficients of any order. Previously, such duality was only known in few cases : as a perfect pairing of finite groups for finite coefficients prime to $\mathrm{char} k_0$ in general, or for any finite coefficients when $k_1$ is $p$-adic ; or as a perfect pairing of locally compact Hausdorff groups for the $\mathrm{fppf}$ cohomology of finite group schemes when $K$ is local. With no obvious reasonable topology available, we abandon perfectness altogether and instead obtain nondegenerate pairings of abstract abelian groups. This is done with new diagram-chasing results for pairings of torsion groups, allowing an approach by d\'evissage which breaks our results down to the study of pairings $K^M_r(K)/p\times H^{d+1-r}_p(K)\to\mathbb Z/p$ using results of Kato.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the support of semiclassical measures for higher-dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cat maps are toy models in quantum chaos associated to hyperbolic symplectic matrices $A\in \operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{Z})$. The macroscopic limits of sequences of eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map are characterized by semiclassical measures on the torus $\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. We show that if the characteristic polynomial of every power $A^k$ is irreducible over the rationals, then every semiclassical measure has full support. The proof uses an earlier strategy of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] and the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen [arXiv:2305.05022]. Our irreducibility condition is generically true, in fact we show that asymptotically for $100\%$ of matrices $A$, the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $S_2 \wr S_n$.
  When the irreducibility condition does not hold, we show that a semiclassical measure cannot be supported on a finite union of parallel non-coisotropic subtori. On the other hand, we give examples of semiclassical measures supported on the union of two transversal symplectic subtori for $n=2$, inspired by the work of Faure-Nonnenmacher-De Bi\`evre [arXiv:nlin/0207060] in the case $n=1$. This is complementary to the examples by Kelmer [arXiv:math-ph/0510079] of semiclassical measures supported on a single coisotropic subtorus.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. Specifically, we construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively controls the aforementioned averages subject to necessary nondegeneracy conditions on the Hardy sequences. Combining this with a variant of the seminorm smoothing argument, we obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. In conjunction with joint ergodicity criteria and classical equidistribution results, these estimates yield a number of novel joint ergodicity results that reach far beyond the state of the art. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) irrationally strongly independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We also positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for all pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned three families are special cases. Lastly, we use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own, including the theory of generalized box seminorms, an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument, improved simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, and a generalization of the seminorm smoothing argument.</description>

Abstract: Let G be an even orthogonal or unitary group over a number field. Based on the same observation used in arXiv:1705.10106, we prove the Arthur's multiplicity formula for the generic part of the automorphic discrete spectrum of G by using the theta lift. We also consider a class of non-generic A-parameters and obtain a multiplicity formula in this case. In particular, we obtain a description of the full automorphic discrete spectrum of even orthogonal or unitary groups with Witt index less or equal to one.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the main results of a 2024 \emph{Advances in Applied Mathematics} paper \cite{XuZhao2021c} about Ap\'{e}ry-type series involving central binomial coefficients and the multiple ($t-$)harmonic sums to parametric Ap\'{e}ry-type series involving parametric binomial coefficients and Hurwitz-type multiple harmonic (star) sums. In particular, we will establish many explicit relations between parametric Ap\'{e}ry-type series involving one or two parametric binomial coefficients and Hurwitz-type multiple zeta values (with $r$-variables) by using the method of iterated integrals.</description>

      <title>Integers expressible as the sum of two rational cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a positive proportion of integers are expressible as the sum of two rational cubes, and a positive proportion are not so expressible, thus proving a conjecture of Davenport. More generally, we prove that a positive proportion (in fact, at least one sixth) of elliptic curves in any cubic twist family have rank 0, and a positive proportion (in fact, at least one sixth) of elliptic curves with good reduction at 2 in any cubic twist family have rank 1.
  Our method involves proving that the average size of the 2-Selmer group of elliptic curves in any cubic twist family, having any given root number, is 3. We accomplish this by generalizing a parametrization, due to the second author and Ho, of elliptic curves with extra structure by pairs of binary cubic forms. We then use a novel combination of geometry-of-numbers methods and the circle method that builds on earlier work of Ruth and the first author. In particular, we make use of a new interpretation of the singular integral and series arising in the circle method in terms of real and $p$-adic Haar measures on the relevant group. We prove a uniformity estimate for integral points on the relevant quadric, which along with a sieve allows us to prove that the average size of the 2-Selmer group over the cubic twist family is 3. By suitably partitioning the subset of curves in the family with given root number, we effect a further sieve to show that the root number is equidistributed and that the same average, now taken over only those curves of given root number, is again 3. Finally, we apply the $p$-parity theorem of Dokchitser-Dokchitser and a $p$-converse theorem of Burungale-Skinner to conclude.
  We also prove the analogue of the above results for the sequence of square numbers: namely, we prove that a positive proportion of square integers are expressible as the sum of two rational cubes, and a positive proportion are not.</description>

      <title>Stacked Pseudo-Convergent Sequences and Polynomial Dedekind Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p\in\mathbb Z$ be a prime, $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ a fixed algebraic closure of the field of $p$-adic numbers and $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}$ the absolute integral closure of the ring of $p$-adic integers. Given a residually algebraic torsion extension $W$ of $\mathbb Z_{(p)}$ to $\mathbb Q(X)$, by Kaplansky's characterization of immediate extensions of valued fields, there exists a pseudo-convergent sequence of transcendental type $E=\{s_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}\subset\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),E}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(s_n)\in\overline{\mathbb Z_p},\text{ for all sufficiently large }n\in\mathbb N\}$. We show here that we may assume that $E$ is stacked, in the sense that, for each $n\in\mathbb N$, the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_n)$ is contained in the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_{n+1})$; this property of $E$ allows us to describe the residue field and value group of $W$. In particular, if $W$ is a DVR, then there exists $\alpha$ in the completion $\mathbb C_p$ of $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$, $\alpha$ transcendental over $\mathbb Q$, such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),\alpha}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(\alpha)\in O_p\}$, where $O_p$ is the unique local ring of $\mathbb C_p$; $\alpha$ belongs to $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ if and only if the residue field extension $W/M\supseteq\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ is finite.
  As an application, we provide a full characterization of the Dedekind domains between $\mathbb Z[X]$ and $\mathbb Q[X]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We show that for each $b \in B(G)$, the strongly regular locus of the inertia stack of $\mathrm{Bun}_G^b$ is open in the inertia stack of $\mathrm{Bun}_G$. As a consequence, we extend the computation of Hansen--Kaletha--Weinstein of trace distributions of the cohomology of local shtuka spaces $\mathrm{Sht}_{G,b,\mu}$ to non-basic $b$ and in some cases beyond the elliptic locus. If $b$ is closed in $B(G,\mu)$, or $b$ is basic and has only one specialization in $B(G,\mu)$, then we compute the trace distribution of the entire strongly regular locus. In the process, we prove some results on the behavior of characteristic classes under cohomologically smooth pullback.</description>

      <title>Mass equidistribution for Poincar\'e series of large index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P_{k,m}$ denote the Poincar\'e series of weight $k$ and index $m$ for the full modular group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, and let $\{P_{k,m}\}$ be a sequence of Poincar\'e series for which $m(k)$ satisfies $m(k) / k \rightarrow\infty$ and $m(k) \ll k^{\frac{3}{2} - \epsilon}$. We prove that the $L^2$ mass of such a sequence equidistributes on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H}$ with respect to the hyperbolic measure as $k$ goes to infinity. As a consequence, we deduce that the zeros of such a sequence $\{P_{k,m}\}$ become uniformly distributed in $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H}$ with respect to the hyperbolic measure.</description>

      <title>Sparse Admissible Sets and a Problem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham asked whether any sparse enough admissible set of natural numbers can be translated into a subset of the primes. By using a greedy construction involving powers of primitive roots, we prove that there exist arbitrarily sparse infinite admissible sets that cannot be translated into a subset of the primes, thus answering this question in the negative. We present three additional constructions as well.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the twisted first moment of central values of the family of primitive quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions using the method of double Dirichlet series together with a recursive argument.

      <title>Classification of the types for which every Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be any finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. It is known by Chase and Sweedler that the Hopf--Galois correspondence is injective for every Hopf--Galois structure on $L/K$, but it need not be bijective in general. Hopf--Galois structures are known to be related to skew braces, and recently, the first-named author and Trappeniers proposed a new version of this connection with the property that the intermediate fields of $L/K$ in the image of the Hopf--Galois correspondence are in bijection with the left ideals of the associated skew brace. As an application, they classified the groups $G$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure on any $G$-Galois extension. In this paper, using a similar approach, we shall classify the groups $N$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$ on any Galois extension.</description>

      <title>The basis problem for modular forms for the Weil representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vector valued theta series of a positive-definite even lattice is a modular form for the Weil representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We show that the space of cusp forms for the Weil representation is generated by such functions. This gives a positive answer to Eichler's basis problem in this case. As applications we derive Waldspurger's result on the basis problem for scalar valued modular forms and give a new proof of the surjectivity of the Borcherds lift based on the analysis of local Picard groups.</description>

Abstract: We determine the distribution of discriminants of wildly ramified elementary-abelian extensions of local and global function fields in characteristic $p$. For local and rational function fields, we also give precise formulae for the number of elementary-abelian extensions with a fixed discriminant divisor, which describe a local-global principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study partitions of totally positive integral elements $\alpha$ in a real quadratic field $K$. We prove that for a fixed integer $m \geq 1$, an element with $m$ partition exists in almost all $K$. We also obtain an upper bound for the norm of $\alpha$ that can be represented as a sum of indecomposables in at most $m$ ways, completely characterize the $\alpha$'s represented in exactly $2$ ways, and subsequently apply this result to complete the search for fields containing an element with $m$ partitions for $1 \leq m \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>A proof of van der Waerden's Conjecture on random Galois groups of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Of the $(2H+1)^n$ monic integer polynomials $f(x)=x^n+a_1 x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_n$ with $\max\{|a_1|,\ldots,|a_n|\}\leq H$, how many have associated Galois group that is not the full symmetric group $S_n$? There are clearly $\gg H^{n-1}$ such polynomials, as may be obtained by setting $a_n=0$. In 1936, van der Waerden conjectured that $O(H^{n-1})$ should in fact also be the correct upper bound for the count of such polynomials. The conjecture has been known previously for degrees $n\leq 4$, due to work of van der Waerden and Chow and Dietmann.
  In this expository article, we outline a proof of van der Waerden's Conjecture for all degrees $n$.</description>

      <title>Schottky-Invariant $p$-Adic Diffusion Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</description>

      <title>The finite products of shifted primes and Moreira's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $r\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{r}C_{i}$. Do there exist $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$ and $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$ such that $\left\{x,y,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$? This is still an unanswered question asked by N. Hindman. Joel Moreira in [Annals of Mathematics 185 (2017) 1069-1090] established a partial answer to this question and proved that for infinitely many $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$, $\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$ for some $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$, which is called Moreira's Theorem. Recently, H. Hindman and D. Strauss established a refinement of Moreira's Theorem and proved that for infinitely many $y$, $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is a piecewise syndetic set. In this article, we will prove infinitely many $y\in FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ such that $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{xy,x+f(y):f\in F\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is piecewise syndetic, where $F$ is a finite subset of $x\mathbb{Z}\left[x\right]$. We denote $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ and $FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ is the set of all finite products of distinct elements of $\mathbb{P}-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra of rank $N$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Associated to $\mathcal{L}$ is a family of polynomial folding maps $$\textsf{F}_{n}:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N\quad\text{for}\quad n\ge1$$ having the property that $\textsf{F}_{n}$ has topological degree $n^N$ and $$\textsf{F}_{m}\circ\textsf{F}_{n}=\textsf{F}_{n}\circ\textsf{F}_{m}\quad\text{for all}\quad m,n\ge1.$$ We derive formulas for the leading terms of the folding maps on $\mathbb{A}^2$ associated to the Lie algebras $\mathcal{A}_2$, $\mathcal{B}_2$, and $\mathcal{G}_2$, and we use these formulas to compute the affine automorphism group of each folding map.</description>
