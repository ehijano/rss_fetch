      <title>Regular Electric Black Holes from EMS Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theories that admit regular electric black holes. Such a Maxwell-scalar theory is equivalent to some nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) at the level of equations of motion, but it has the advantage of circumventing the no-go theorem of regular electric black holes under a given Lagrangian of NLED. We study the thermodynamics and show that the mass of the regular black hole can be determined solely by the Maxwell field, without having to know the metric profile function. Our formalism allows to study the applications of the electrically-charged regular black holes in areas that were previously available only to the non-regular ones.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>Evolution of creases on the event horizon of a black hole merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic black hole merger occurs through a restructuring of creases (sharp edges) on the event horizon. This process is studied for a black hole merger in the limit of infinite mass ratio, for which constructing the event horizon reduces to finding a null hypersurface that asymptotes to a Rindler horizon in the Kerr spacetime. Geometrical properties of the creases on this horizon are determined and the results are compared with the predictions of an exact local description of the event horizon in a generic merger. The crease set is shown to have finite area. A recently proposed expression for the gravitational entropy of a crease is shown to diverge at the instant of merger. Caustics on (and off) the event horizon are determined by exploiting the correspondence with the problem of gravitational lensing by a Kerr black hole. Caustics form an "astroid tube" in spacetime, two edges of which lie on the event horizon of the merger. Perturbative expressions for the location of this tube are presented, extending previous work to much higher perturbative order.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the gravitational scattering in the absence of peeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetries of the gravitational scattering are intimately tied to the symmetries which preserve asymptotic flatness at null infinity. In Penrose's definition of asymptotic flatness, a central role is played by the notion of asymptotic simplicity and the ensuing peeling behavior which dictates the decay rate of the Weyl tensor. However, there is now accumulating evidence that in a generic gravitational scattering the peeling property is broken, so that the spacetime is not asymptotically-flat in the usual sense. These obstructions to peeling can be traced back to the existence of universal radiative low frequency observables called ''tails to the displacement memory''. The universality of these tail modes is the statement of the classical logarithmic soft graviton theorem of Sahoo, Saha and Sen. Four-dimensional gravitation scattering therefore exhibits a rich infrared interplay between tail to the memory, loss of peeling, and universal logarithmic soft theorems. In this paper we study the solution space and the asymptotic symmetries for logarithmically-asymptotically-flat spacetimes. These are defined by a polyhomogeneous expansion of the Bondi metric which gives rise to a loss of peeling, and represent the classical arena which can accommodate a generic gravitational scattering containing tails to the memory. We show that while the codimension-two generalized BMS charges are sensitive to the loss of peeling at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the flux is insensitive to the fate of peeling. Due to the tail to the memory, the soft superrotation flux contains a logarithmic divergence whose coefficient is the quantity which is conserved in the scattering by virtue of the logarithmic soft theorem. In our analysis we also exhibit new logarithmic evolution equations and flux-balance laws, whose presence suggests the existence of an infinite tower of subleading logarithmic soft graviton theorems.</description>

      <title>Motion of a weakly charged rotating black hole in a homogeneous electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a rotating black hole with electric and magnetic monopole charges that moves in a static homogeneous electromagnetic field. We assume that both the charges and the fields are weak, so that they have no effect on the spacetime geometry, which is described by the Kerr metric. We present exact solutions to Maxwell's equations describing the field of a charged rotating black hole moving in an external field background. We use these solutions to calculate the energy, momentum, and angular momentum fluxes of the electromagnetic field into the black hole. Using these results, we obtain expressions for the torque and force acting on the moving charged rotating black hole arising as a result of its interaction with the external electromagnetic field. We calculate these quantities both in the frame comoving with the black hole and in the frame of the external background field. We use this result to derive the equations that govern the change in the black hole's mass and spin, as well as the motion of the black hole. We provide exact solutions for specific cases which illustrate the role of charge and spin on the motion of the black hole.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe quantization schemes for scalar field cosmology in the metric variables with fundamental discreteness imposed with a lattice. The variables chosen for quantization determine the lattice, and each lattice produces its own "effective" equations derived from semiclassical states. We show that requiring a bounce at the Planck density uniquely selects the volume lattice and gives the same effective Friedmann equation as that obtained in loop quantum cosmology. We also present conditions for the validity of the effective equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars: the massive scalar field scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze numerically the dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars in the framework of a scalar-tensor theory of gravity where the scalar field is free but massive, and it is coupled non minimally to gravity in the Jordan frame. We show that the quasi-static configuration of the star that settles after the transition can avoid the observational constraints imposed on the amount of scalarization by several observations in binary systems due to the presence of the mass term, which suppresses the range of the scalar field. We also study the impact of the scalar field mass on the total mass of the star relative to the massless scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work deals with Einstein-aether Scalar tensor gravity in the background of homogeneous and isotropic flat FLRW space-time model. The Noether symmetry vector identifies a transformation in the augmented space so that the field equations become solvable. The cosmological solutions are analyzed from the observational point of view. Finally, for quantum cosmology, the Wheeler-DeWitt (WD) has been formulated and solutions have been determined by identifying the periodic nature of the wave function using conserved (Noether) charge.</description>

      <title>Scalarization of Taub-NUT Black Holes in Extended scalar-tensor-Gauss-Bonnet Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, scalarization of Schwarzschild black hole are extensively studied. In this work, we explore the scalarization of Taub-NUT black hole. The theory we consider is the extended scalar-tensor-Gauss-Bonnet theory, which admits Ricci-flat Taub-NUT black hole as a solution. An analysis of probe scalar field is carried out to identify the mass parameter and NUT parameter (m,n) where the hairy black holes start to emerge. Then, we use shooting method to construct the scalarized Taub-NUT black hole numerically. Being different from the Schwarzschild case, there exists two branches of new hairy black holes which are smoothly connected to each other. We calculate the entropy of scalarized black holes and compare it with the entropy of scalar-free Taub-NUT black holes, it turns out that the entropy of the new hairy black holes are larger than that of scalar-free black holes. A novel phenomena emerges in this system that the entropy of the black holes at the bifurcation point is constant for positive mass parameter. We then conjecture a maximal entropy bound for all the scalarized black hole whose mass parameter at the bifurcation point is greater than zero.</description>

      <title>A description of classical and quantum cosmology for a single scalar field torsion gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the background of homogeneous and isotropic flat FLRW space-time, both classical and quantum cosmology has been studied for teleparallel dark energy (DE) model. Using Noether symmetry analysis, not only the symmetry vector but also the coupling function in the Lagrangian and the potential of the scalar field has been determined. Also symmetry analysis identifies a cyclic variable in the Lagrangian along the symmetry vector and as a result the Lagrangian simplifies to a great extend so that classical solution is obtained. Subsequently, in quantum cosmology Wheeler-DeWitt(WD) equation has been constructed and the quantum version of the conserved momenta corresponding to Noether symmetry identifies the periodic part of the wave function of the universe and as a result the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes solvable. Finally, quantum description shows finite non-zero probability at the classical big-bang singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel thermodynamic phenomenon has been observed in the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, utilizing generalized free energy and Kramer escape rate. This phenomenon also reveals the unique property of the quantum black hole. The stochastic thermal motion of various thermodynamic states within the black hole system induces phase transitions, under the influence of generalized free energy which obtained by extending Maxwell's construction. Through the analysis of Kramer escape rate, it is discovered that the qBTZ black hole thermodynamic system exhibits a bounce effect. Furthermore, the overall thermodynamic picture of the qBTZ black hole has been obtained under different quantum backreactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global time is a gauge or relational choice of time variable in canonical gravity. Local time is the time used in a flat patch of spacetime. We compare the dynamics of a scalar field with respect to choices of global time and Minkowski patch time in an expanding cosmology. Our main results are that evolutions starting from the same initial conditions are similar on the time scales of terrestrial experiments, and that global time leads to a mechanism for evolving coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Characterizing a class of accelerating wormholes with periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly discovered Wormhole C--metric is a solution of Einstein's field equation coupled with a phantom scalar field which describes the accelerated wormholes. In the zero acceleration limit the solution reduces to an asymptotically flat wormhole. For certain range of parameter space this solution doesn't possess any horizon, thus making it a viable candidate of wormhole. To completely unveil this property we have studied the topological properties of this spacetime and shown that the throat is marginally connected. In the aforementioned range of parameters, the spacetime doesn't posses any photon orbit confirming the absence of shadow. We further analysed the stability of this spacetime under scalar perturbation. Under the usual boundary conditions (outgoing waves at both spatial infinities) there exists a continuous spectra. On the contrary one may achieve the quantization of the modes by exploiting a different but physically intuitive boundary condition. The lowest lying mode behaves as normal mode, and the imaginary part comes into play for the modes corresponding to first overtone number $(n=1)$ marking the onset of quasi-nomral modes for all azimuthal quantum number, $L$. We have also argued that the spacetime has a tendency to hold the excitation in it due to the external perturbation, rather than a fast de-excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the development of Brans-Dicke gravity, it has become well-known that a conformal transformation of the metric can reformulate this theory, transferring the coupling of the scalar field from the Ricci scalar to the matter sector. Specifically, in this new frame, known as the Einstein frame, Brans-Dicke gravity is reformulated as General Relativity supplemented by an additional scalar field. In 1959, Hans Adolf Buchdahl utilized an elegant technique to derive a set of solutions for the vacuum field equations within this gravitational framework. In this paper, we extend Buchdahl's method to incorporate the cosmological constant and to the scalar-tensor cases beyond the Brans-Dicke archetypal theory, thereby, with a conformal transformation of the metric, obtaining solutions for a version of Brans-Dicke theory that includes a quadratic potential. More specifically, we obtain synchronous solutions in the following contexts: in scalar-tensor gravity with massless scalar fields, Brans-Dicke theory with a quadratic potential, where we obtain specific synchronous metrics to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, the Nariai solution, and a hyperbolically foliated solution.</description>

      <title>Topological AdS black holes surrounded by Chaplygin dark fluid: from stability to geometrothermodynamic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing the concept of Dark Fluid with a Chaplygin-like equation of state within General Relativity, we construct a new higher-dimensional, static, and spherically symmetric anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole solution. Energy conditions are explored alongside curvature singularity tools. The inspection at the level of the phase structure and $P-v$ critical behavior is carried out in the context of the extended phase space, where the cosmological constant appears as pressure. Our findings disclose non-trivial similarities between the small/large phase transition of AdS black holes surrounded by Chaplygin dark fluid and van der Waals systems' liquid/gas phase transition. This analysis offers insights into the physical interpretation of the $P-v$ diagram and identifies critical exponents that reveal the scaling behavior of thermodynamic quantities close to criticality in a universal manner. We finally deepen our understanding of the thermodynamic properties and microstructure of AdS black holes by leveraging the geometrothermodynamic formalism. Specifically, we employ tools, including Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Hendi-Panahiyan-Eslam-Momennia (HPEM) and Quevedo classes I and II. We show that each class of metrics predicts either the physical limitation point and/or the phase-transition critical points, with HPEM and Quevedo formulations providing richer information about the phase transitions. Altogether, this study contributes to advancing our knowledge of the role of Chaplygin gas in General Relativity and thoroughly examining the thermodynamic phase structure of high-dimensional AdS black holes under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <title>Quantized area of the Schwarzschild black hole: A non-hermitian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work our aim is to link Bekenstein's quantized form of the area of the event horizon to the Hamiltonian of the non-Hermitian Swanson oscillator which is known to be parity-time-symmetric. We achieve this by employing a similarity transformation that maps the non-Hermitian quantum system to a scaled harmonics oscillator. To this end, we consider the unconstrained reduced Hamiltonian which is directly expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild mass and implies a periodic character for the conjugate momentum (which represents the asymptotic time coordinate), the period being the inverse Hawking temperature. This leads to the quantization of the event-horizon area in terms of the harmonic oscillator levels. Next, in the framework of the Swanson oscillator model, we proceed to derive novel expressions for the corresponding Hawking temperature and black hole entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present charged spherically symmetric black hole solutions and slowly rotating charged solutions in bumblebee gravity with and without a cosmological constant. The static spherically symmetric solutions describe the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole and ReissnerNordstr\"om-(anti) de Sitter-like black hole, while the stationary and axially symmetric soltuions describe Kerr-Newman-like black hole and Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter-like black hole. We utilize the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to study the shadows of the black holes. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the electric charge and Lorentz-violating parameters on the radius of the shadow reference circle and the distortion parameter. We find that the radius of the reference circle decreases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and charge parameter, while the distortion parameter increases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and the charge parameter.</description>

      <title>The Memory of Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves, after they enter the horizon and decay away, leave a residual displacement in test particles: a memory, in analogy with gravitational waves generated by astrophysical sources. The displacement in the distance between test particles $\xi^i$ does not depend on the cosmological evolution, but only on the primordial value $\bar h^i_{j}$ of the gravitational wave: $\Delta \xi^i = -\frac 12 \bar h^i_{j} \xi^j$. The memory is thus related to the adiabatic tensor mode that maps the unperturbed FLRW geometries at early and late times; this is analogous to the relation between memory in Minkowski spacetime and the BMS group. The primordial memory is also connected to the consistency relations of cosmological correlators, as the flat-space memory is related to the soft theorems for gravitational wave emission. We comment on the signature of the effect on the CMB $B$-modes and on the large-scale structure. There is also a primordial memory effect that is subleading in the spatial gradients of the wave: it is encoded in the rotation of free-falling gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>PhenomGSF: A phenomenological model of gravitational self-force enhanced tides in inspiralling binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiralling binary neutron stars provide unique access to ultra-dense nuclear matter and offer the ability to constrain the currently unknown neutron star equation-of-state through tidal measurements. This, however, requires the availability of accurate and efficient tidal waveform models. In this paper we present PhenomGSF, a new phenomenological tidal phase model for the inspiral of neutron stars in the frequency-domain, which captures the gravitational self-force informed tidal contributions of the time-domain effective-one-body model TEOBResumS. PhenomGSF is highly faithful and computationally efficient, and by choosing a modular approach, it can be used in conjunction with any frequency-domain binary black hole waveform model to generate the complete phase for a binary neutron star inspiral. PhenomGSF is valid for neutron star binaries with unequal masses and mass ratios between 1 and 3, and dimensionless tidal deformabilities up to 5000. Furthermore, PhenomGSF does not assume universal relations or parameterised equations-of-state, hence allowing for exotic matter analyses and beyond standard model physics investigations. We demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of our model through comparisons against TEOBResumS, numerical relativity waveforms and full Bayesian inference, including a reanalysis of the binary neutron star observation GW170817.</description>

      <title>The Potential Impact of Noise Correlation in Next-generation Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the statistical formulation for parameter estimation in the presence of correlated noise proposed by Cireddu et al., we present an initial study to incorporate the effects of correlated noise into the analyses of various detector designs' performance. We consider a two L-shaped detector configuration located in the European Union, and compare the expectation of parameter estimation between the non-colocated and a hypothetical colocated configurations. In our study, we posit the existence of low-frequency correlated noise within the $5\text{ Hz}$ to $10\text{ Hz}$ range for the colocated detector configuration, with a varying degree of correlation. In this specific detector setup, our observations indicate an enhancement in the precision of intrinsic parameter measurements as the degree of correlation increases. This trend suggests that higher degrees of noise correlation may beneficially influence the accuracy of parameter estimation. In particular, when the noise is highly correlated, the uncertainty on chirp mass decreases by up to $30\%$. The absence of an inter-European baseline does hinder the estimation of the extrinsic parameters. However, given a realistic global network with the additional detector located in the United States, the uncertainty of extrinsic parameters is significantly reduced. This reduction is further amplified as the degree of noise correlation increases. When noise correlation exceeds a certain level, the colocated configuration outperforms the non-colocated one, reducing the $90\%$ credible area of sky location by up to $10\%$. We conclude that noise correlation significantly impacts detector performance, potentially altering both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. Thus, we recommend including noise correlation in comprehensive assessments of third-generation gravitational wave detector designs.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Fragmention in Gravitationally-Unstable Collapsar Disks and Sub-Solar Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although stable neutron stars (NS) can in principle exist down to masses Mns ~ 0.1Msun, standard models of stellar core-collapse predict a robust lower limit Mns &gt;~ 1.2Msun, roughly commensurate with the Chandrasekhar mass Mch of the progenitor's iron core (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.5). However, this limit may be circumvented in sufficiently dense neutron-rich environments (Ye &lt;&lt; 0.5) for which Mch ~ Ye^2 is reduced to &lt; Msun. Such physical conditions could arise in the black hole accretion disks formed from the collapse of rapidly-rotating stars (``collapsars''), as a result of gravitational instabilities and cooling-induced fragmentation, similar to models for planet formation in protostellar disks. We confirm that the conditions to form sub-solar mass NS (ssNS) may be marginally satisfied in the outer regions of massive neutrino-cooled collapsar disks. If the disk fragments into multiple ssNS, their subsequent coalescence offers a channel for precipitating sub-solar mass LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave mergers that does not implicate primordial black holes. The model makes several additional predictions: (1) ~Hz frequency Doppler modulation of the ssNS-merger gravitational wave signals due to the binary's orbital motion in the disk; (2) at least one additional gravitational wave event (coincident within &lt;~ hours), from the coalescence of the ssNS-merger remnant(s) with the central black hole; (3) an associated gamma-ray burst and supernova counterpart, the latter boosted in energy and enriched with r-process elements from the NS merger(s) embedded within the exploding stellar envelope (``kilonovae inside a supernova'').</description>

      <title>General relativistic viscous accretion flow around a gravitational wave inspired black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of accretion flows around Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black hole, proposed by deforming Kerr spacetime to address the inaccuracies in the observation of gravitational waves resulting from a binary black hole merger. The dynamical equations describing the general relativistic viscous accreting flow are solved self-consistently to find the transonic accretion solutions in terms of global constants, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($\mathcal{L}$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), spin ($a_{k}$), and deformation parameter ($\eta_0$). We obtain five distinct types of accretion solutions (O, A, $\text{A}^{\prime}$, W, and I-types) and observe that those solutions are not unique but rather continue to exist for wide range of parameter spaces in the $\mathcal{L}-E$ plane. Furthermore, we find that the viscous accretion flows can harbor shock waves when relativistic shock conditions are satisfied. Consequently, the shock-induced global accretion solutions are obtained and the effect of $\eta_0$ on shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$) and change in electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) across the shock front are investigated. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accretion flow using the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung emission coefficient and study the modification of SEDs due to the increase of $\eta_0$ for both shock-induced and shock-free solutions. In addition, it has been noticed that the observable quantities, like quasi-periodic oscillation frequency ($\nu_{\rm QPO}$) and bolometric disc luminosity ($L$), are strongly depend on $\eta_0$. Finally, we phenomenologically show that the KZ black hole is consistent with the observed high-frequency QPOs, commonly observed in black hole binaries and black hole candidates.</description>

Abstract: Supernova theory has struggled to explain the lightest known neutron star candidate with an accurate mass determination, the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ companion in the eccentric compact binary system J0453+1559. To improve the theoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova simulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core collapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a substantial kick of $\mathord{\sim} 100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Given residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ object remains plausible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach, we construct, at the linearized level, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric curvatures generalizing scalar curvature, Ricci curvature and Weyl tensor. These supercurvatures are the building blocks of various linearized $4D, \, \mathcal{N}=2$ Einstein supergravity invariants. The supercurvatures involving the scalar and Ricci curvatures are analytic harmonic ${\cal N}=2$ superfields, while the Weyl supertensor is a chiral $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield. As the basic distinguished feature of our construction, all these objects are expressed through the fundamental analytic gauge prepotentials $h^{++M}, M= (\alpha\dot\alpha, +\alpha, +\dot\alpha, 5)$. The related characteristic features are the heavy use of harmonic derivatives and harmonic zero-curvature equations. On a number of instructive examples, we describe the component reduction of the superfield invariants constructed.</description>

Abstract: We implemented symbolic regression techniques to identify suitable analytical functions that map various properties of neutron stars (NSs), obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, to a few key parameters of the equation of state (EoS). These symbolic regression models (SRMs) are then employed to perform Bayesian inference with a comprehensive dataset from nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. The posterior distributions of EoS parameters obtained from Bayesian inference using SRMs closely match those obtained directly from the solutions of TOV equations. Our SRM-based approach is approximately 100 times faster, enabling efficient Bayesian analyses across different combinations of data to explore their sensitivity to various EoS parameters within a reasonably short time.</description>

Abstract: Scalar field theories with a shift symmetry come equipped with the $K$-mouflage (or kinetic screening) mechanism that suppresses the scalar interaction between massive objects below a certain distance, the screening radius. In this work, we study the linear response of the scalar field distribution around a screened (point-like) object subject to a long range external scalar field perturbation for the Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. We find that, for regular boundary conditions at the position of the particle, some multipoles have vanishing response for a lacunar series of the multipole order $\ell$ for any dimension. Some multipoles also exhibit a logarithmic running when the number of spatial dimensions is even. We construct a ladder operator structure, with its associated ladder symmetries, formed by two sets of ladders that are related to the properties of the linear response and the existence of conserved charges. Our results exhibit a remarkable resemblance with the Love numbers properties of black holes in General Relativity, although some intriguing differences subsist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of prior selection on the inferred mass and spin parameters of the neutron star-black hole merger GW230529\_181500. Specifically, we explore models motivated by astrophysical considerations, including massive binary and pulsar evolution. We examine mass and spin distributions of neutron stars constrained by radio pulsar observations, alongside black hole spin observations from previous gravitational wave detections. We show that the inferred mass distribution highly depends upon the spin prior. Specifically, under the most restrictive, binary stellar evolution models, we obtain narrower distributions of masses with a black hole mass of $4.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3} \,M_\odot$ and neutron star mass of $1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ where, somewhat surprisingly, it is the prior on component spins which has the greatest impact on the inferred mass distributions. Re-weighting using neutron star mass and spin priors from observations of radio pulsars, with black hole spins from observations of gravitational waves, yields the black hole and the neutron star masses to be $3.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6} \,M_\odot$ and $1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ respectively. The sequence of compact object formation -- whether the neutron star or the black hole formed first -- cannot be determined at the observed signal-to-noise ratio. However, there is no evidence that the black hole was tidally spun up.</description>

Abstract: Coincident multi-messenger observation of cosmic sources can offer numerous benefits. One significant advantage is enhancing the detection significance of separate detectors by correlating their data and assuming a joint emission. We have formulated an approach for updating the Bayesian posterior probability of an astrophysical origin, namely $p_{\rm astro}$, relying on multi-messenger coincidences. We demonstrated this with candidate coincident gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos. Applying our method to the public data of candidate coincident high-energy neutrinos with subthreshold gravitational-wave triggers, we found that in the case of highly energetic neutrino coincidences, $p_{\rm astro}$ can increase from approximately $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.9$. This marked improvement makes subthreshold detections much more confident.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the cosmological dynamics arising from the interaction between a 2-form field and cold dark matter within a Bianchi I background. Employing a dynamical system analysis, we identify two attractors yielding to exponential expansion of the Universe, i.e., de-Sitter solutions. Notably, these solutions exhibit a pivotal distinction: one is indistinguishable from the cosmological constant scenario, while the other corresponds to an \emph{anisotropic de-Sitter} expansion sourced by the 2-form field. To validate the asymptotic behavior of our model, we conduct a numerical exploration of its expansion history. Our analysis reveals that the coupling between the dark sectors amplifies the shear during the matter-dominated epoch, offering a potential avenue to address certain observational discrepancies related to the structure formation process. Then, we constrain the parameter space of the model using recent observational datasets. Remarkably, we find that the current shear is precisely constrained to be approximately $\Sigma_0 \approx - 10^{-4}$. We also discuss some key differences in the expansionary dynamics sourced by the 2-form field compared to a 1-form field, i.e., a vector field, offering insights into their respective impacts on the support they provide to late-time anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Investigating the hyperbolic and hybrid scalar field cosmologies with varying cosmological constant in $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04076v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigated two scalar field cosmological models in $f(R,T)$ gravity with cosmic transit and varying cosmological constant $\Lambda(t)$.The cosmological constant tends to have a tiny positive value in the current epoch.The scalar field pressure $p_{\phi}$ shows a sign reversal for a normal scalar field. For the phantom field, the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ is negative and the energy density $\rho_{\phi}=E_k+V$ takes negative values when the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\phi}$ is less than $-1$. While the weak energy condition WEC implies that the total energy density $\rho=\sum_i\rho_i\geq 0$, we still can have a negative $\rho$ term as long as the total $\rho$ is positive. In the current work we argue that the WEC, $\rho=\sum_i \rho_i \geq 0$ and $p_i+\rho_i \geq 0$, is not violated but with an instability for the second model at late-times. For a scalar field $\phi$, The condition $\rho_{\phi}+p_{\phi}=\rho_{\phi} (1+\omega_{\phi})=2E_k\geq 0$ allows for $\rho_{\phi}&lt;0$ if $\omega_{\phi}&lt;-1$. The causality and energy conditions have been discussed for both models.
  The cosmology in both models was studied using a given function $a(t)$ derived from the desired cosmic behavior, which is the opposite of the traditional view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By refining the method proposed in arXiv:2010.07660, entropy current and entropy density for a relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium system with spherical symmetry are constructed as a non-Noether conserved charge in the Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. It is shown that the constructed entropy density satisfies both the local Euler relation and the first law of thermodynamics non-perturbatively with respect to the Newton constant. Finally the established relativistic thermodynamics is applied to one of the systems with uniform energy density as a crude model of a degenerate star and its local thermodynamic observables are determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Mass, charge, and distance to Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in terms of directly measurable quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a general relativistic formalism and develop new theoretical tools that allow us to analytically express the mass and electric charge of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole as well as its distance to a distant observer in terms of few directly observable quantities, such as the total frequency shift, aperture angle of the telescope, and redshift rapidity. Our analytic and concise formulas are valid on the midline, and the redshift rapidity is a relativistic invariant observable that represents the evolution of the frequency shift with respect to the proper time in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. This procedure is applicable for particles undergoing circular motion around a spherically symmetric and electrically charged black hole, which is the case for accretion disks orbiting supermassive black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei. Although this type of black hole is expected to be electrically neutral, our results provide a novel method to measure the electric charge of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, hence can shed some light on this claim. Besides, these results allow us to measure the mass of the black hole and its distance from the Earth, and we can employ the general formulas in black hole parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting string-inspired running-vacuum models under the lens of light primordial black holes</title>

Abstract: Light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}&lt;10^9\mathrm{g}$ can interestingly dominate the Universe's energy budget and give rise to early matter-dominated (eMD) eras before Big Bang Nucleosyntesis (BBN). During this eMD era, one is met with an abundant production of induced gravitational waves (GWs) serving as a portal to constrain the underlying theory of gravity. In this work, we study this type of induced GWs within the context of string-inspired running-vaccuum models (StRVMs), which, when expanded around de Sitter backgrounds, include logarithmic corrections of the space-time curvature. In particular, we discuss in detail the effects of StRVMs on the source as well as on the propagation of these PBH-induced GWs. Remarkably, under the assumption that the logarithmic terms represent quantum gravity corrections in the PBH era, we show that GW overproduction can be avoided if one assumes a coefficient of these logarithmic corrections that is much larger than the square of the reduced Planck mass. The latter cannot characterise quantum gravity corrections, though, prompting the need for revision of the quantisation of StRVMs in different than de Sitter backgrounds, such as those characterising PBH-driven eMD eras. This non trivial result suggests the importance of light PBHs as probes of new physics.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves in horizon cosmology and constraints on entropic parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hallmark of the 4-parameter generalized entropy is that it can represent various known entropies proposed so far for suitable limits of the parameters, and thus the 4-parameter generalized entropy can be applied on additive as well as on non-additive systems. Thereafter the proposal of the generalized entropy, it becomes important to constrain the corresponding parameters. In the present work, we intend to do this from the perspective of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated during inflation. In the background level, the generalized entropy successfully drives a viable and smooth evolution of the universe, particularly from inflation to reheating followed by a radiation era, for certain ranges of the entropic parameters. Consequently we investigate whether such viable ranges of the entropic parameters (coming from the background level) allow the primordial GWs spectrum to pass through the sensitivity curves of various GWs observatories. Therefore, if the future observatories can detect the signal of primordial GWs, then our theoretical expectation carried in the present work may provide a possible tool for the measurement of the generalized entropic parameters.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <title>Graviton Mass and Entanglement Islands in Low Spacetime Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured and proven that entanglement island is not consistent with long-range (massless) gravity in a large class of spacetimes, including typical asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, in high spacetime dimensions. The conjecture and its proof are motivated by the observation that existing constructions of entanglement islands in high dimensions are all in gravitational theories where the graviton is massive for which the standard gravitational Gauss' law doesn't apply. In this letter, we show that this observation persists to lower dimensional cases. We achieve this goal by providing a unified description of the gravitational Gauss' law violation in island models that can work in any dimensions. This unified description teaches us new lessons on entanglement islands and subregion physics in quantum gravity. We focus on the case of the (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity for the purpose of demonstration.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity signatures in gravitational wave detectors placed inside a harmonic trap potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general gravitational wave detector of gravitational wave interacting with an incoming gravitational wave carrying plus polarization only placed inside a harmonic trap. This model can be well acquainted with the description of a resonant detector of gravitational wave as well. The well known detector-gravitational wave interaction scenario uses the method of a semi classical approach where the detector is treated quantum mechanically but the gravitational wave is considered at a classical level. In our analysis, we use a discrete mode decomposition of the gravitational wave perturbation which results in a Hamiltonian involving the position and momentum operators corresponding to the gravitational wave and the harmonic oscillator. We have then calculated the transition probability for the harmonic oscillator-gravitational wave tensor product state for going from an initial state to some unknown final state. Using the energy flux relation of the gravitational waves, we observe that if we consider the total energy as a combination of the number of gravitons in the initial state of the detector then the transition probability for the resonant absorption case scenario takes the analytical form which is exactly similar to the semi-classical absorption case. In case of the emission scenario, we observe a spontaneous emission of a single graviton which was completely absent in the semi-classical analouge of this model. This therefore gives a direct signature of linearized quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Accelerated protons produced by magnetic Penrose process in Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical mechanisms to extract energies from a rotating black hole are the Blandford-Znajek process and the Penrose process. The Penrose process requires a special condition that is difficult to occur in common astrophysical situations. However, the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) does not require such a special condition, and can produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays. When neutrons decay near a rotating black hole, the MPP efficiency of the produced proton is maximized. The supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow that is hot enough to produce neutrons by nuclear reactions, which can be subsequently accelerated to high-energy by the MPP. We calculate the production rate of accelerated protons from the Sgr A* to estimated the gamma-ray flux at Earth produced by these accelerated protons and the flux of the accelerated protons themselves transported from Sgr A* to Earth. We find that these very high-energy gamma rays ($E_{\gamma}\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{TeV}$) amount to a significant fraction of the flux of the gamma-ray from the HESS J1745-290 and the central molecular zone around $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The accelerated proton flux, when the dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}=0.5$ and the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the black hole $B_{0}=100\,\mathrm{G}$, is about $1.6-4.1\%$ of the cosmic ray proton flux from KASCADE experiment at about $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. Due to the finite decay time of neutrons which need to be transported from the accretion flow to the acceleration zone, our acceleration model can operate only around black holes with mass not much greater than $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We embed the Penrose limit into the Weyl classical double copy. Thereby, we provide a lift of the double copy properties of plane wave spacetimes into black hole geometries and we open a novel avenue towards taking the classical double copy beyond statements about algebraically special backgrounds. In particular, the Penrose limit, viewed as the leading order Fermi coordinate expansion around a null geodesic, complements approaches leveraging asymptotic flatness such as the asymptotic Weyl double copy. Along the way, we show how our embedding of the Penrose limit within the Weyl double copy naturally fixes the functional ambiguity in the double copy for Petrov type N spacetimes. We also highlight the utility of a spinorial approach to the Penrose limit. In particular, we use this spinorial approach to derive a simple analytical expression for arbitrary Penrose limits of four-dimensional, vacuum type D spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Exponential Modification of AdS Black Hole and Thermodynamic Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an exponential modification for the action of an AdS black hole in the absence of a matter field. An approximated black hole solution is obtained up to the third order of perturbation coefficient. A thermodynamic investigation in canonical ensemble shows that the behavior of a Van der Waals fluid is not seen in this model. Nevertheless, the study of thermodynamic potentials and other related quantities suggests that the thermodynamic phase transitions of the first and second types can occur in this model. The forms of the phase transitions are more similar to the Hawking-Page phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a set of cosmological N-body simulations with standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology but characterized by a scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type featuring a power-law dependence of the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}(k)$ at large scales followed by a saturation to a constant value at smaller scales where non-linear growth leads to the formation of collapsed cosmic structures. Such models are built to ensure consistency with current Cosmic Microwave Background bounds on primordial non-Gaussianity yet allowing for large effects of the non-Gaussian statistics on the properties of non-linear structure formation. We show the impact of such scale-dependent non-Gaussian scenarios on a wide range of properties of the resulting cosmic structures, such as the non-linear matter power spectrum, the halo and sub-halo mass functions, the concentration-mass relation, the halo and void density profiles, and we highlight for the first time that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter for several of such observables</description>
