      <title>Tax systems for sustainable economic development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete description of taxation systems that ensure sustainable economic development is given. These tax systems depend on production technologies and gross output volumes. Explicit formulas for such dependencies are found. In a sustainable economy, the value added either exceeds or is strictly less than the value of the product produced. The latter is determined by the tax system. The concept of perfect taxation systems is introduced and their explicit form is found. For perfect taxation systems, it is proved that the vector of gross output should belong to the interior of the cone formed by the vectors of the columns of the total cost matrix. It is shown that under perfect taxation systems the vector of gross output must satisfy a certain system of linear homogeneous equations. It is shown, that under certain conditions there are tax systems under which certain industries require subsidies for their existence. Under such taxation systems, the industries that require subsidies are identified. The family of all non negative solutions of the system of linear equations and inequalities is constructed, which allowed us to formulate a criterion for describing all equilibrium states in which partial clearing of markets occurs.</description>

      <title>KANOP: A Data-Efficient Option Pricing Model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we introduce the KAN-based Option Pricing (KANOP) model to value American-style options, building on the conventional Least Square Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm. KANs, which are based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a data-efficient alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons, requiring fewer hidden layers to achieve a higher level of performance. By leveraging the flexibility of KANs, KANOP provides a learnable alternative to the conventional set of basis functions used in the LSMC model, allowing the model to adapt to the pricing task and effectively estimate the expected continuation value. Using examples of standard American and Asian-American options, we demonstrate that KANOP produces more reliable option value estimates, both for single-dimensional cases and in more complex scenarios involving multiple input variables. The delta estimated by the KANOP model is also more accurate than that obtained using conventional basis functions, which is crucial for effective option hedging. Graphical illustrations further validate KANOP's ability to accurately model the expected continuation value for American-style options.</description>

      <title>Tighter 'uniform bounds for Black-Scholes implied volatility' and the applications to root-finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the option delta systematically, we derive tighter lower and upper bounds of the Black-Scholes implied volatility than those in Tehranchi [SIAM J. Financ. Math. 7 (2016), 893-916]. As an application, we propose a Newton-Raphson algorithm on the log price that converges rapidly for all price ranges when using a new lower bound as an initial guess. Our new algorithm is a better alternative to the widely used naive Newton-Raphson algorithm, whose convergence is slow for extreme option prices.</description>
