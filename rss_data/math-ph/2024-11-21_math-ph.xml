      <title>Time-harmonic waves in Korteweg and nematic-Korteweg fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Helmholtz--Korteweg equation, which models acoustic waves in Korteweg fluids. We further derive a nematic variant of the Helmholtz-Korteweg equation, which incorporates an additional orientational term in the stress tensor. Its dispersion relation coincides with that arising in Virga's analysis of the Euler-Korteweg equations, which we extend to consider imaginary wave numbers and the effect of boundary conditions. In particular, our extensions allow us to analyze the effect of nematic orientation on the penetration depth of evanescent plane waves, and on the scattering of sound waves by obstacles. Furthermore, we make new, experimentally-verifiable predictions for the effect of boundary conditions for a modification of the Mullen-L\"uthi-Stephen experiment, and for the scattering of acoustic waves in nematic-Korteweg fluids by a circular obstacle.</description>

      <title>Shell Models on Recurrent Sequences: Fibonacci, Padovan and Other Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new class of shell models is proposed, where the shell variables are defined on a recurrent sequence of integer wave-numbers such as the Fibonacci or the Padovan series, or their variations including a sequence made of square roots of Fibonacci numbers rounded to the nearest integer. Considering the simplest model, which involves only local interactions, the interaction coefficients can be generalized in such a way that the inviscid invariants, such as energy and helicity, can be conserved even though there is no exact self-similarity. It is shown that these models basically have identical features with standard shell models, and produce the same power law spectra, similar spectral fluxes and analogous deviation from self-similar scaling of the structure functions implying comparable levels of turbulent intermittency. Such a formulation potentially opens up the possibility of using shell models, or their generalizations along with discretized regular grids, such as those found in direct numerical simulations, either as diagnostic tools, or subgrid models. It also allows to develop models where the wave-number shells can be interpreted as sparsely decimated sets of wave-numbers over an initially regular grid. In addition to conventional shell models with local interactions that result in forward cascade, a particular helical shell model with long range interactions is considered on a similarly recurrent sequence of wave numbers, corresponding to the Fibonacci series, and found to result in the usual inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>An exceptionally simple family of Orthosymplectic 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at a family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 orthosymplectic quiver gauge theories. We define a superconformal field theory (SCFT) to be rank-0 if either the Higgs branch or Coulomb branch is trivial. This family of non-linear orthosymplectic quivers has Coulomb branches that can be factorized into products of known moduli spaces. More importantly, the Higgs branches are all trivial. Consequently, the full moduli space of the smallest member is simply $\mathrm{(one-}F_4 \; \mathrm{instanton}) \times \mathrm{(one-}F_4 \; \mathrm{instanton})$. Although the $3d$ mirror is non-Lagrangian, it can be understood through the gauging of topological symmetries of Lagrangian theories. Since the 3d mirror possesses a trivial Coulomb branch, we discuss some implications for rank-0 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and symplectic duality.</description>

      <title>On the ill-posedness of kinetic wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we identify a sharp ill-posedness/well-posedness threshold for kinetic wave equations (KWE) derived from quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger models. Our analysis shows that KWE becomes ill-posed in a range where the original quasilinear equation is itself well-posed. We also prove that both the gain-only and full equation share the same well-posedness threshold, thus legitimizing a gain-only approach to solving 4-wave kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Height-offset variables and pinning at infinity for gradient Gibbs measures on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general theory of height-offset variables and their properties for nearest-neighbor integer-valued gradient models on trees. This notion goes back to Sheffield [25], who realized that such tail-measurable variables can be used to associate to gradient Gibbs measures also proper Gibbs measures, via the procedure of pinning at infinity. On the constructive side, our theory incorporates the existence of height-offset variables, regularity properties of their Lebesgue densities and concentration properties of the associated Gibbs measure. On the pathological side, we show that pinning at infinity necessarily comes at a cost. This phenomenon will be analyzed on the levels of translation invariance, the tree-indexed Markov chain property, and extremality. The scope of our theory incorporates free measures, and also height-periodic measures of period 2, assuming only finite second moments of the transfer operator which encodes the nearest neighbor interaction. Our proofs are based on investigations of the respective martingale limits, past and future tail-decompositions, and infinite product representations for moment generating functions.</description>

      <title>Measurement in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topic of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory is addressed in this article. Some of the long standing problems of this subject are highlighted, including the incompatibility of an instantaneous ``collapse of the wavefunction'' with relativity of simultaneity, and the difficulty of maintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by ``impossible measurement'' scenarios. Thereafter, the issue is considered from the perspective of mathematical physics. To this end, quantum field theory is described in a model-independent, operator algebraic setting, on generic Lorentzian spacetime manifolds. The process of measurement is modelled by a localized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the ``system'', and another quantum field, called the ``probe''. The result of the dynamical coupling is a scattering map, whereby measurements carried out on the probe can be interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system. The localization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for the induced observables. It will be discussed how this approach leads to the concept of selective or non-selective system state updates conditioned on the result of probe measurements, which in turn allows it to obtain conditional probabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic causality and general covariance, without the need for a physical collapse of the wavefunction. In particular, the problem of impossible measurements is resolved. Finally, there is a brief discussion of accelerated detectors and other related work.</description>

      <title>Conformal and Contact Kinetic Dynamics and Their Geometrization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a conformal generalization of the reversible Vlasov equation of kinetic plasma dynamics, called conformal kinetic theory. In order to arrive at this formalism, we start with the conformal Hamiltonian dynamics of particles and lift it to the dynamical formulation of the associated kinetic theory. The resulting theory represents a simple example of a geometric pathway from dissipative particle motion to dissipative kinetic motion. We also derive the kinetic equations of a continuum of particles governed by the contact Hamiltonian dynamics, which may be interpreted in the context of relativistic mechanics. Once again we start with the contact Hamiltonian dynamics and lift it to a kinetic theory, called contact kinetic dynamics. Finally, we project the contact kinetic theory to conformal kinetic theory so that they form a geometric hierarchy.</description>

      <title>New Partial Trace Inequalities and Distillability of Werner States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in quantum information theory is to study if there exists a state with negative partial transpose which is undistillable. This problem has been open for almost 30 years, and still no one has been able to give a complete answer to it. This work presents a new strategy to try to solve this problem by translating the distillability condition on the family of Werner states into a problem of partial trace inequalities, this is the aim of our first main result. As a consequence we obtain a new bound for the $2$-distillability of Werner states, which does not depend on the dimension of the system. On the other hand, our second main result provides new partial trace inequalities for bipartite systems, connecting some of them also with the separability of Werner states. Throughout this work we also present numerous partial trace inequalities, which are valid for many families of matrices.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is ever-increasing, driven largely by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with decomposing the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is unambiguous for massive particles, there are numerous proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here, we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, such as photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. The obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-SO(3) symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between dynamical symmetries, Cartan symmetries, and dynamical similarities in contact mechanics. Using an alternative decomposition of vector fields, we provide a characterization of those symmetries and a new description in terms of tensor densities. Additionally, we show that, in certain cases, this construction enables the recovery of integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>Dg Loday-Pirashvili modules over Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Loday-Pirashvili module over a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie algebra object $\bigl(G\xrightarrow{X} \mathfrak{g} \bigr)$ in the category of linear maps, or equivalently, a $\mathfrak{g}$-module $G$ which admits a $\mathfrak{g}$-equivariant linear map $X:G\to \mathfrak{g}$. We study dg Loday-Pirashvili modules over Lie algebras, which is a generalization of Loday-Pirashvili modules in a natural way, and establish several equivalent characterizations of dg Loday-Pirashvili modules. To provide a concise characterization, a dg Loday-Pirashvili module is a non-negative and bounded dg $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$ paired with a weak morphism of dg $\mathfrak{g}$-modules $\alpha\colon V\rightsquigarrow \mathfrak{g}$. Such a dg Loday-Pirashvili module resolves an arbitrarily specified classical Loday-Pirashvili module in the sense that it exists and is unique (up to homotopy). Dg Loday-Pirashvili modules can be characterized through dg derivations. This perspective allows the calculation of the corresponding twisted Atiyah classes. By leveraging the Kapranov functor on the dg derivation arising from a dg Loday-Pirashvili module $(V,\alpha)$, a Leibniz$_\infty[1]$ algebra structure can be derived on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^\vee\otimes V[1]$. The binary bracket of this structure corresponds to the twisted Atiyah cocycle. To exemplify these intricate algebraic structures through specific cases, we utilize this machinery to a particular type of dg Loday-Pirashvili modules stemming from Lie algebra pairs.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the constant Yang-Baxter equation: additive charge conservation in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find all solutions to the constant Yang--Baxter equation $R_{12}R_{13}R_{23}=R_{23}R_{13}R_{12}$ in three dimensions, subject to an additive charge-conservation ansatz. This ansatz is a generalisation of (strict) charge-conservation, for which a complete classification in all dimensions was recently obtained. Additive charge-conservation introduces additional sector-coupling parameters -- in 3 dimensions there are $4$ such parameters. In the generic dimension 3 case, in which all of the $4$ parameters are nonzero, we find there is a single 3 parameter family of solutions. We give a complete analysis of this solution, giving the structure of the centraliser (symmetry) algebra in all orders. We also solve the remaining cases with three, two, or one nonzero sector-coupling parameter(s).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Markov chains (QMCs) are positive maps on a trace-class space describing open quantum dynamics on graphs. Such objects have a statistical resemblance with classical random walks, while at the same time it allows for internal (quantum) degrees of freedom. In this work we study continuous-time QMCs on the integer line, half-line and finite segments, so that we are able to obtain exact probability calculations in terms of the associated matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials and measures. The methods employed here are applicable to a wide range of settings, but we will restrict to classes of examples for which the Lindblad generators are induced by a single positive map, and such that the Stieltjes transforms of the measures and their inverses can be calculated explicitly.</description>

Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and Burgers turbulence in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of initial long-wavelength excitations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain has been the subject of intense investigations since the pioneering work of Fermi and collaborators. We have recently found a new regime where the spectrum of the Fourier modes decays with a power-law and we have interpreted this regime as a transient turbulence associated with the Burgers equation. In this paper we present the full derivation of the latter equation from the lattice dynamics using a newly developed infinite dimensional Hamiltonian perturbation theory. This theory allows us to relate the time evolution of the Fourier spectrum $E_k$ of the Burgers equation to the one of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain. As a consequence, we derive analytically both the shock time and the power-law $-8/3$ of the spectrum at this time. Using the shock time as a unit, we follow numerically the time-evolution of the spectrum and observe the persistence of the power $-2$ over an extensive time window. The exponent $-2$ has been widely discussed in the literature on the Burgers equation. The analysis of the Burgers equation in Fourier space also gives information on the time evolution of the energy of each single mode which, at short time, is also a power-law depending on the $k$-th wavenumber $E_k \sim t^{2k-2}$. This approach to the FPUT dynamics opens the way to a wider study of scaling regimes arising from more general initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of charged dual-unitary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all modular invariant representations of the Kac--Moody algebras. For the Kac--Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ the string functions of admissible representations are allowed to have certain rational levels and were realized by Ahn, Chung, and Tye as the characters of the generalized Fateev--Zamolodchikov parafermionic theories. For the $1/2$-level string functions, we present their mixed mock modular properties as well as elegant mock theta conjecture-like identities involving two mock theta functions from Ramanujan's Lost Notebook. In addition, we demonstrate that the negative level string functions can be evaluated in terms of false theta functions.</description>

      <title>Condensation effects in kinetic models for consensus dynamics: finite-time blow-up and regularity aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The analysis shows that the regularity of the solution is strongly linked to the degree of nonlinearity in the drift, and that finite-time blow-up of the solution can occur when the degree of nonlinearity is sufficiently high. However, the presence of diffusion prevents the solution from forming condensation after the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <title>Infinite series involving special functions obtained using simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analytically evaluate certain classes of infinite sums involving special functions such as generalized hypergeometric functions, associated Laguerre polynomials, Bessel and Struve functions. The calculations are founded on the basic quantum mechanical principles applied to simple quantum mechanical models, namely half harmonic oscillator and model of a particle trapped inside an infinite potential well. We also show that some classes of functions which are not regular wave functions allow evaluation of additional infinite sums.</description>
