      <title>How much are LLMs changing the language of academic papers after ChatGPT? A multi-database and full text analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) are influencing the language of academic papers by tracking 12 LLM-associated terms across six major scholarly databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), Dimensions, and OpenAlex) from 2015 to 2024. Using over 2.4 million PMC open-access publications (2021-July 2025), we also analysed full texts to assess changes in the frequency and co-occurrence of these terms before and after ChatGPT's initial public release. Across databases, delve (+1,500%), underscore (+1,000%), and intricate (+700%) had the largest increases between 2022 and 2024. Growth in LLM-term usage was much higher in STEM fields than in social sciences and arts and humanities. In PMC full texts, the proportion of papers using underscore six or more times increased by over 10,000% from 2022 to 2025, followed by intricate (+5,400%) and meticulous (+2,800%). Nearly half of all 2024 PMC papers using any LLM term also included underscore, compared with only 3%-14% of papers before ChatGPT in 2022. Papers using one LLM term are now much more likely to include other terms. For example, in 2024, underscore strongly correlated with pivotal (0.449) and delve (0.311), compared with very weak associations in 2022 (0.032 and 0.018, respectively). These findings provide the first large-scale evidence based on full-text publications and multiple databases that some LLM-related terms are now being used much more frequently and together. The rapid uptake of LLMs to support scholarly publishing is a welcome development reducing the language barrier to academic publishing for non-English speakers.</description>

      <title>Examining Different Research Communities: Authorship Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Google Scholar is one of the top search engines to access research articles across multiple disciplines for scholarly literature. Google scholar advance search option gives the privilege to extract articles based on phrases, publishers name, authors name, time duration etc. In this work, we collected Google Scholar data (2000-2021) for two different research domains in computer science: Data Mining and Software Engineering. The scholar database resources are powerful for network analysis, data mining, and identify links between authors via authorship network. We examined coauthor-ship network for each domain and studied their network structure. Extensive experiments are performed to analyze publications trend and identifying influential authors and affiliated organizations for each domain. The network analysis shows that the networks features are distinct from one another and exhibit small communities within the influential authors of a particular domain.</description>
