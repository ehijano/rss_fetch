      <title>A Review of Artificial Intelligence in Brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize brachytherapy's clinical workflow. This review comprehensively examines the application of AI, focusing on machine learning and deep learning, in facilitating various aspects of brachytherapy. We analyze AI's role in making brachytherapy treatments more personalized, efficient, and effective. The applications are systematically categorized into seven categories: imaging, preplanning, treatment planning, applicator reconstruction, quality assurance, outcome prediction, and real-time monitoring. Each major category is further subdivided based on cancer type or specific tasks, with detailed summaries of models, data sizes, and results presented in corresponding tables. This review offers insights into the current advancements, challenges, and the impact of AI on treatment paradigms, encouraging further research to expand its clinical utility.</description>

      <title>Real-time fetAl brain and placental T2* mapping at 0.55T low-field MRI (RAT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To provide real-time quantitative organ-specific information - specifically placental and brain T2* - to allow optimization of the MR examination to the individual patient.
  Methods: A FIRE-based real-time setup segmenting placenta and fetal brain in real-time, performing T2* fitting and analysis and calculation of the centile was implemented. A nn-UNet were trained and tested on 2989 datasets for the fetal brain and a second one trained on 210 datasets for the placenta for automatic segmentation. T2* normal curves were obtained from 106 cases and prospective evaluation was performed on 10 cases between 35 and 39 weeks GA.
  Results: Quantitative brain and placental T2* maps and centiles were available in all prospective cases within 30 seconds. The robustness of the method was shown with intra-scan repeats (mean difference 1.04+/-12.39 ms for fetal brain and -3.15+/-8.88 ms for placenta) and direct validation with vendor-processed offline results (mean difference 1.62+/-4.33 ms for fetal brain and 0.16+/-6.19 ms for placenta).
  Discussion and Conclusion: Real-time available organ-specific quantitative information enables more personalized MR examinations, selection of the most pertinent sequences and thus the promise of reduced recalls and specific insights into tissue properties. The here enabled placental T2*, demonstrated in multiple recent studies to be a biomarker sensitive to a range of pregnancy complications, and fetal brain T2* will be explored in further studies in pregnancies with pre-eclampsia, growth restriction as a way of enabling future MR-guided fetal interventions.</description>

      <title>A dosimetric and robustness analysis of Proton Arc Therapy (PAT) with Early Energy Layer and Spot Assignment (ELSA) for lung cancer versus conventional Intensity modulated therapy (IMPT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and purpose: IMPT faces challenges in lung cancer treatment, like maintaining plan robustness for moving tumors against setup, range errors, and interplay effects. Proton Arc Therapy (PAT) is an alternative to maintain target coverage, potentially improving organ at risk (OAR) sparing, reducing beam delivery time (BDT), and enhancing patient experience. We aim to perform a systematic plan comparison study between IMPT and ELSA-PAT to assess its potential for lung cancer treatment. Material and Methods: 14 Lung ELSA-PAT plans were compared retrospectively with IMPT plans. 4D worst-case minimax robust optimization was performed, including 84 scenarios (3%,3 mm). Dosimetry assessment included target (CTV) and important OARs, on nominal and worst-case scenarios. Most relevant normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP), target coverage robustness against interplay effect and beam delivery time (BDT) were evaluated. Results: CTV D95% and D98% showed no significant difference in comparison. PAT demonstrated better conformality by 66% (p = 0.00012) but delivered a higher heart mean dose (HMD,23%). There was a 2% increase in NTCP 2-year mortality risk with PAT. Total BDT was comparable among techniques. IMPT was more robust than PAT against interplay effect, considering both D1% (1,0 $\pm$ 0.8 Gy vs 1.1 $\pm$ 1.4 Gy) and D98% bandwidths (0.9$\pm$0.9 Gy vs 1.1 $\pm$ 1.3 Gy). Interpretation: both techniques provide a similar level of dose coverage to the target volume. Although PAT improved dose conformality, higher HMD translated into increased heart toxicity, presumably due to chosen planning methodology and OAR proximity to target. Increased energy layers and spots raised PAT beam delivery time, although it could improve daily treatment workflow.</description>

      <title>Tailored 3D microphantoms: an essential tool for quantitative phase tomography analysis of organoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for benchmarking and validating quantitative phase tomography (QPT) systems using three-dimensional microphantoms. These microphantoms, crafted from biological and imaging data, replicate the optical and structural properties of multicellular biological samples. Their fabrication featuring refractive index modulation at sub-micrometer details is enabled by two-photon polymerization. We showcase the effectiveness of our technique via a round-robin test of healthy and tumoral liver organoid phantoms across three different QPT systems. This test reveals sample- and system-dependent errors in measuring dry mass and morphology. Tailored microphantoms establish the gold standard for the optimization of hardware setups, reconstruction strategies and error assessment, paving the way for novel non-invasive, label-free measurements of 3D biological samples.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal scintillation using one-dimensional magneto-optical photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scintillation describes the conversion of high-energy particles into light in transparent media and finds diverse applications such as high-energy particle detection and industrial and medical imaging. This process operates on multiple timescales, with the final radiative step consisting of spontaneous emission, which can be modeled within the framework of quasi-equilibrium fluctuational electrodynamics. Scintillation can therefore be controlled and enhanced via nanophotonic effects, which has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Such designs have thus far obeyed Lorentz reciprocity, meaning there is a direct equivalence between scintillation emission and absorption by the scintillator. However, scintillators that do not obey Lorentz reciprocity have not been explored, even though they represent a novel platform for probing emission which is both nonequilibrium and nonreciprocal in nature. In this work, we propose to harness nonreciprocity to achieve directional control of scintillation emission, granting an additional degree of control over scintillation. Such directionality of light output is important in improving collection efficiencies along the directions where detectors are located. We present the design of a nonreciprocal scintillator using a one-dimensional magnetophotonic crystal in the Voigt configuration. Our work demonstrates the potential of controlling nonequilibrium emission such as scintillation by breaking reciprocity and expands the space of nanophotonic design for achieving such control.</description>

      <title>Collimator-less SPECT System Design for Dynamic Whole-body Imaging</title>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a Compton SPECT system for whole-body imaging of Actinium-225 (225Ac), one of the trending radionuclides for targeted alpha therapy (TAT). The Compton SPECT system enables multi-energy gamma photon detection with higher efficiency compared to mechanically collimated SPECT. The system consists of two detectors, providing a field of view (FOV) adequate for whole-body imaging, while achieving high sensitivity and clinically usable imaging resolution within a reasonable scanning time. This work focuses on the system design and evaluation using the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Gate. The imaging performance is evaluated at two energy peaks (218 keV, 440 keV), representing the major detectable gamma energies generated from 225Ac. We explore the possibility of using the Compton SPECT system for treatment response monitoring in TAT. Results demonstrate an image resolution of 1.0 cm using a NEMA IQ phantom with 5.7 MBq of 225Ac simulated in a cold background. An image resolution of 1.3 cm can be achieved with a hot to background ratio of 30:1, and a resolution of 3.7 cm can be achieved with an activity ratio of 12:1. The best achievable sensitivity at 10 cm distance to the detector is 0.5% with the two energy windows (211-225 keV, 430-450 keV) selected. The proposed system may serve as an alternative imaging tool for TAT scanning in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Characterization of Oral Soft Tissues in vivo Using the Burr Speckle Model</title>

Abstract: Periodontal diseases, reportedly affect 4 out of 10 adults in the USA. The standard of care for clinical assessments of these diseases is invasive, subjective and semi-qualitative. Thus, research on proposing alternate noninvasive modalities for clinical assessments of periodontal tissues is crucial. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) has shown promises in noninvasive assessments of various diseases in soft biological tissues; however, it has not been employed in periodontology. Here as the first step, we focused on QUS-based characterization of two very adjacent oral soft tissues of alveolar mucosa and attached gingiva in an in vivo animal study. We investigated first order ultrasonic speckle statistics using the two-parameter Burr model (b and l). Our QUS analysis was compared with the Masson$'$s Trichrome histology images of the two oral tissue types quantitatively using the RGB color thresholding. QUS study included 10 swine and US scanning was performed at the first and second molars, resulting in 80 scans. US scan data was acquired at the frequency of 24 MHz. Results at both oral sites (molar 1 and molar 2) showed that difference between the two tissue types using Burr parameters were statistically significant (p$&lt;0.0001$). The average Burr b was reported higher in attached gingiva while the average Burr l was lower compared to mucosa. The color thresholding of these images confirmed that the percent of blue, which stains collagenous regions, was at least two times higher in gingiva compared with alveolar mucosa. It was suggested that the elevated Burr b (related to potential scatterer densities) in gingiva could be aligned with findings from histology. This study showed a promising potential of QUS for clinical assessment of periodontal soft tissues.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy for Model-Based Reconstruction in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging is a tracer-based tomographic imaging technique that allows the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles to be determined with high spatio-temporal resolution. To reconstruct an image of the tracer concentration, the magnetization dynamics of the particles must be accurately modeled. A popular ensemble model is based on solving the Fokker-Plank equation, taking into account either Brownian or N\'eel dynamics. The disadvantage of this model is that it is computationally expensive due to an underlying stiff differential equation. A simplified model is the equilibrium model, which can be evaluated directly but in most relevant cases it suffers from a non-negligible modeling error. In the present work, we investigate an extended version of the equilibrium model that can account for particle anisotropy. We show that this model can be expressed as a series of Bessel functions, which can be truncated based on a predefined accuracy, leading to very short computation times, which are about three orders of magnitude lower than equivalent Fokker-Planck computation times. We investigate the accuracy of the model for 2D Lissajous magnetic particle imaging sequences and show that the difference between the Fokker-Planck and the equilibrium model with anisotropy is sufficiently small so that the latter model can be used for image reconstruction on experimental data with only marginal loss of image quality, even compared to a system matrix-based reconstruction.</description>
