      <title>Classical electrodynamics as a tool to examine optical effects of chiral dielectrics and media with magnetic conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how classical electromagnetic techniques are useful to describe optical effects in conventional and chiral dielectric systems endowed with optical activity. Starting from the Maxwell equations and constitutive relations of the medium, we obtain the wave equation (for the electric field) that yields the refractive indices and the corresponding propagating modes that define the electromagnetic wave polarization. This procedure is employed for bi-isotropic and bi-anisotropic dielectrics, allowing us to determine birefringence, a manifestation of the space or time inversion breaking, typical of the chiral media. Such a method can also be applied for axion electrodynamics and a dielectric supporting an isotropic chiral magnetic current, similar to the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). For a diagonal magnetic conductivity, two distinct refractive indices are found, associated with left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) waves, and yielding circular birefringence (evaluated in terms of the optical rotatory power). Additionally, the scenario of a bi-isotropic medium endowed with isotropic magnetic current is examined, where a rotatory power marked by sign reversal may work as an optical signature of this particular system.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale sub-Doppler atomic spectroscopy enabled by a metasurface integrated photonic emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate chip-scale sub-Doppler spectroscopy in an integrated and fiber-coupled photonic-metasurface device. The device is a stack of three planar components: a photonic mode expanding grating emitter circuit with a monolithically integrated tilt compensating dielectric metasurface, a microfabricated atomic vapor cell and a mirror. The metasurface photonic circuit efficiently emits a 130 micrometer-wide $1/e^2$ diameter) collimated surface-normal beam with only -6.3 dB loss and couples the reflected beam back into the connecting fiber, requiring no alignment between the stacked components. We develop a simple model based on light propagation through the photonic device to interpret the atomic spectroscopy signals and explain spectral features covering the full Rb hyperfine state manifold.</description>

      <title>Low-power threshold optical bistability enabled by hydrodynamic Kerr nonlinearity of free-carriers in heavily doped semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate nanoscale optical bistability at an exceptionally low power threshold of 1 mW by leveraging Kerr-type hydrodynamic nonlinearities due to the heavily doped semiconductor's free carriers. This high nonlinearity is enabled by a strong coupling between metallic nanopatch surface plasmons and longitudinal bulk plasmons (LBP) that arise in heavily doped semiconductors due to the nonlocality. Through the coupling, an efficient, near-unity conversion of far-field energy into LBP states could be achieved. These findings offer a viable approach to experimentally probe LBPs and lay the groundwork for developing efficient and ultrafast all-optical nonlinear devices.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Quantum Cascade Laser Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-layer perceptron neural network was used to predict the laser transition figure of merit, a measure of the laser threshold gain, of over 900 million Quantum Cascade Laser designs using only layer thicknesses and the applied electric field as inputs. Designs were generated by randomly altering the layer thicknesses of an initial 10-layer design. Validating the predictions with our 1D Schr\"odinger solver, the predicted values show 5% to 15% error for structures where a laser transition could occur, and 35% to 70% error for structures where there was no laser transition. The algorithm allowed (i) for the identification of high figure of merit structures, (ii) recognition of which layers should be altered to maximize the figure of merit at a given electric field, and (iii) increased the original design figure of merit of 94.7 to 141.2 eV ps \r{A}^2, a 1.5-fold improvement and significant for QC lasers. The computational time for laser design data collection is greatly reduced from 32 hours for 27000 designs using our 1D Schr\"odinger solver on a virtual machine, to 8 hours for 907 million designs using the machine learning algorithm on a laptop computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iridophore networks in the skin of neon tetra fish are investigated for use as biologically sourced, tunable, Bragg reflector arrays. This paper reports on a method for immediate and fast post-processing of tissue to modify the structural color of iridophores found in the lateral color stripe. Conditions for fixation as well as the environment post-fixation to improve longevity of the structural color are also presented. Recent results from attempts to further increase the lifetime of post-mortem iridophore color through infiltration and embedding in low-acid glycol methacrylate are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Growth of VO2-ZnS Thin Film Cavity for Adaptive Thermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-weight, passive, thermal-adaptive radiation technologies are needed to maintain an operable temperature for spacecraft while they experience various energy fluxes. In this study, we used a thin-film coating with the Fabry-Perot (FP) effect to enhance emissivity contrast ({\Delta}{\epsilon}) between VO2 phase-change states. This coating utilizes a novel hybrid material architecture that combines VO2 with a mid- and long-wave infrared transparent chalcogenide, zinc sulfide (ZnS), as a cavity spacer layer. We simulated the design parameter space to obtain a theoretical maximum {\Delta}{\epsilon} of 0.63 and grew prototype devices. Using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, we determined that an intermediate buffer layer of TiO2 is necessary to execute the crystalline growth of monoclinic VO2 on ZnS. Through temperature-dependent FTIR spectroscopy measurements, our fabricated devices demonstrated FP-cavity enhanced adaptive thermal emittance.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of the localization length for TE waves at critical incidence on short-range correlated stratified random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the scaling behavior of the localization length for $s$-polarized electromagnetic waves incident at a critical angle on stratified random media with short-range correlated disorder. By employing the invariant embedding method, extended to waves in correlated random media, and utilizing the Shapiro-Loginov formula of differentiation, we accurately compute the localization length $\xi$ of $s$ waves incident obliquely on stratified random media that exhibit short-range correlated dichotomous randomness in the dielectric permittivity. The random component of the permittivity is characterized by the disorder strength parameter $\sigma^2$ and the disorder correlation length $l_c$. Away from the critical angle, $\xi$ depends on these parameters independently. However, precisely at the critical angle, we discover that for waves with wavenumber $k$, $k\xi$ depends on the single parameter $kl_c\sigma^2$, satisfying a universal equation $k\xi\approx 1.3717\left(kl_c\sigma^2\right)^{-1/3}$ across the entire range of parameter values. Additionally, we find that $\xi$ scales as ${\lambda}^{4/3}$ for the entire range of the wavelength $\lambda$, regardless of the values of $\sigma^2$ and $l_c$. We demonstrate that under sufficiently strong disorder, the scaling behavior of the localization length for all other incident angles converges to that for the critical incidence.</description>

      <title>Designing metasurface optical interfaces for solid-state qubits using many-body adjoint shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general strategy for the inverse design of metasurfaces composed of elementary shapes. We use it to design a structure that collects and collimates light from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Such metasurfaces constitute scalable optical interfaces for solid-state qubits, enabling efficient photon coupling into optical fibers and eliminating free-space collection optics. The many-body shape optimization strategy is a practical alternative to topology optimization that explicitly enforces material and fabrication constraints throughout the optimization, while still achieving high performance. The metasurface is easily adaptable to other solid-state qubits, and the optimization method is broadly applicable to fabrication-constrained photonic design problems.</description>

      <title>Optical microscope with nanometer longitudinal resolution based on a Linnik interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscope based on the Linnik interferometer was designed, built, and tested. Two methods were used for interference pattern measurement: phase-shifting and polarized single-shot methods. The former uses a low coherence light emitting diode as a light source, providing 10 nm resolution in the Z direction and diffraction-limited resolution in the X and Y directions. The second method is insensitive to vibrations and enables observation of moving objects. The simplicity and low cost of this instrument make it valuable for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Single MoS2-flake as a high TCR non-cryogenic bolometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of a bolometer can be tuned by modifying the thermal conductance of an absorbing materials since they sense radiations via the temperature change in the absorber. However, the thermal conductance of the absorber can be reduced by engineering the appropriate thermal isolation, which can be an ultimate solution towards making a highly sensitive thermal detector. Here, we have developed an atomically thin 2D bolometer detector made up of a mechanically transferred suspended multilayer-MoS2 flake, eliminating the use of challenging thin-film fabrication process. The strength of our detector lies on the two factors: its large surface-to-volume window to absorb the radiations; the suspended configuration which prevents the heat dissipation through the substrate and therefore reduces the thermal conductance. The bolometric response of the detector is tested in both modes, via the photoresponse and the thermal response. The prototype is found to exhibit a very high TCR ~ -9.5%/K with the least achievable thermal noise-equivalent power (NEP) ~ 0.61 pWHz-1/2, in ambient conditions at 328 K.</description>

      <title>Optical Investigations of Coherence and Relaxation Dynamics of a Thulium-doped Yttrium Gallium Garnet Crystal at sub-Kelvin Temperatures for Optical Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth ion-doped crystals are of great interest for quantum memories, a central component in future quantum repeaters. To assess the promise of 1$\%$ Tm$^{3+}$-doped yttrium gallium garnet (Tm:YGG), we report measurements of optical coherence and energy-level lifetimes of its $^3$H$_6$ $\leftrightarrow$ $^3$H$_4$ transition at a temperature of around 500 mK and various magnetic fields. Using spectral hole burning, we find hyperfine ground-level (Zeeman level) lifetimes of several minutes at magnetic fields of less than 1000 G. We also measure coherence time exceeding one millisecond using two-pulse photon echoes. Three-pulse photon echo and spectral hole burning measurements reveal that due to spectral diffusion, the effective coherence time reduces to a few $\mu$s over a timescale of around two hundred seconds. Finally, temporal and frequency-multiplexed storage of optical pulses using the atomic frequency comb protocol is demonstrated. Our results suggest Tm:YGG to be promising for multiplexed photonic quantum memory for quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence enhancement of single V2 centers in a 4H-SiC cavity antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid state quantum emitters are a prime candidate in distributed quantum technologies since they inherently provide a spin-photon interface. An ongoing challenge in the field, however, is the low photon extraction due to the high refractive index of typical host materials. This challenge can be overcome using photonic structures. Here, we report the integration of V2 centers in a cavity-based optical antenna. The structure consists of a silver-coated, 135 nm thin 4H-SiC membrane functioning as a planar cavity with a broadband resonance yielding a theoretical photon collection enhancement factor of 34. The planar geometry allows us to identify over 20 single V2 centers at room temperature with a mean (maximum) count rate enhancement factor of 9 (15). Moreover, we observe 10 V2 centers with a mean absorption linewidth below 80MHz at cryogenic temperatures. These results demonstrate a photon collection enhancement that is robust to the lateral emitter position.</description>

      <title>Light-induced fictitious magnetic fields for quantum storage in cold atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have demonstrated that optically generated fictitious magnetic fields can be utilized to extend the lifetime of quantum memories in cold atomic ensembles. All the degrees of freedom of an AC Stark shift such as polarization, spatial profile, and temporal waveform can be readily controlled in a precise manner. Temporal fluctuations over several experimental cycles, and spatial inhomogeneities along a cold atomic gas have been compensated by an optical beam. The advantage of the use of fictitious magnetic fields for quantum storage stems from the speed and spatial precision that these fields can be synthesized. Our simple and versatile technique can find widespread application in coherent pulse and single-photon storage in any atomic species.</description>

      <title>Towards a sub-kelvin cryogenic Fabry-Perot silicon cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a sub-kelvin, single-crystal silicon Fabry-Perot cavity. Operating such a cavity below 1~K should reduce the thermal noise limit of the cavity, and by this way address the current limitations of ultrastable lasers. To further decrease mechanical losses, mirrors with silicon substrates and crystalline coatings are optically contacted to the spacer, resulting in a room-temperature finesse of 220,000. To operate our cavity at sub-kelvin temperatures, we use a dilution refrigerator able to reach temperatures down to 10 mK. We have designed a mechanical mount to house our cavity in such a cryostat, with optimized heat transfer that will decrease the cooldown time for temperatures below 1~K. The estimated thermal noise is projected to be $\sim 7{\times}10^{-19}$ at 100~mK. However, silicon cavities with crystalline mirror coatings at cryogenic temperatures have shown birefringence correlated frequency fluctuations as well as unknown additional noise mechanisms \cite{yu2023, kedar2023}. We have measured a room-temperature TEM$_{00}$ birefringent mode splitting of about 250 kHz. Understanding and measuring these noise mechanisms will be a key to attaining fractional frequency stabilities beyond state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Invariant multiscale neural networks for data-scarce scientific applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Success of machine learning (ML) in the modern world is largely determined by abundance of data. However at many industrial and scientific problems, amount of data is limited. Application of ML methods to data-scarce scientific problems can be made more effective via several routes, one of them is equivariant neural networks possessing knowledge of symmetries. Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states. The suggested invariant multiscale architectures increase expressibility of networks, which allow them to perform better in all considered cases.</description>

      <title>Coherent Optical Modems for Full-Wavefield Lidar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the digital age has driven the development of coherent optical modems -- devices that modulate the amplitude and phase of light in multiple polarization states. These modems transmit data through fiber optic cables that are thousands of kilometers in length at data rates exceeding one terabit per second. This remarkable technology is made possible through near-THz-rate programmable control and sensing of the full optical wavefield. While coherent optical modems form the backbone of telecommunications networks around the world, their extraordinary capabilities also provide unique opportunities for imaging. Here, we introduce full-wavefield lidar: a new imaging modality that repurposes off-the-shelf coherent optical modems to simultaneously measure distance, axial velocity, and polarization. We demonstrate this modality by combining a 74 GHz-bandwidth coherent optical modem with free-space coupling optics and scanning mirrors. We develop a time-resolved image formation model for this system and formulate a maximum-likelihood reconstruction algorithm to recover depth, velocity, and polarization information at each scene point from the modem's raw transmitted and received symbols. Compared to existing lidars, full-wavefield lidar promises improved mm-scale ranging accuracy from brief, microsecond exposure times, reliable velocimetry, and robustness to intererence from ambient light or other lidar signals.</description>

      <title>Inversion of simulated and experimental light scattering data for characterization of two-dimensional randomly rough metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An approach is presented for the inversion of simulated and experimental in-plane, co-polarized light scattering data in p and s polarization to obtain the normalized surface-height autocorrelation function and the rms-roughness of a two-dimensional randomly rough metal surface. The approach is based on an expression, obtained on the basis of second-order phase perturbation theory, for the contribution to the mean differential reflection coefficient from the light scattered diffusely by the rough surface. The inversion scheme is validated by using several sets of computer generated scattering data for rough silver surfaces defined by Gaussian surface height correlation functions. The reconstructions obtained by this approach are found to be rather accurate for weakly rough surfaces illuminated by p- and s-polarized incident light; this is also true in cases where the contributions to the input data from multiple scattering of surface plasmon polaritons is not insignificant. Finally, the inversion scheme is applied to experimental scattering data obtained for characterized two-dimensional randomly rough gold surfaces, and the results obtained in this way, compare favorably to what is obtained by directly analyzing the surface morphology. Such results testify to the attractiveness of the computationally efficient inversion scheme that we propose.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momenta and Geometric Phase Characteristics of Spin-polarized Components of a General Paraxial Beam-field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a subtle and fundamental nature of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in a general paraxial beam-field by mathematically characterizing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) flux densities of the spin-polarized component fields via Barnett's flux determination formalism. We show the application of our formalism by considering the special case of a Brewster-reflected paraxial beam, for which we explore specific details such as non-canonical vortex phase structures and single-photon interpretation of the field function. The phases of the spin-component fields are interpreted as geometric phases; and we devise an experimental method of direct measurement of these phases by transferring the spatial phase information to the polarization domain -- thus demonstrating a classical analog von Neumann measurement. Our complete mathematical characterization of SOI and its relevance to the direct measurement of geometric phase can find potential application in future methods exploring OAM and geometric phase characteristics in other general optical systems.</description>

      <title>GaSb-based Interband Cascade Laser with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an interband cascade laser (ICL) emitting at 5.2 {\mu}m consisting of an 8-stage active region and a hybrid cladding composed of outer plasmon-enhanced InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 and inner InAs/AlSb superlattice claddings. The hybrid cladding architecture shows an increase in mode-confinement in the active region by 11.2 % according to the simulation. This is a consequence of a significantly lower refractive index of plasmon-enhanced claddings. The threshold current density is 242 A/cm^2 in pulsed operation at room temperature. This is the lowest value reported to date for ICLs emitting at wavelengths longer than 5 {\mu}m. We also report close to record value threshold power density of 840 W/cm^2 for ICLs at such wavelengths.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuits on thin-film ScAlN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) has recently emerged as an attractive material for integrated photonics due to its favorable nonlinear optical properties and compatibility with CMOS fabrication. Despite the promising and versatile material properties, it is still an outstanding challenge to realize low-loss photonic circuits on thin-film ScAlN-on-insulator wafers. Here, we present a systematic study on the material quality of sputtered thin-film ScAlN produced in a CMOS-compatible 200 mm line, and an optimized fabrication process to yield 400 nm thick, fully etched waveguides. With surface polishing and annealing, we achieve micro-ring resonators with an intrinsic quality factor as high as $1.47\times 10^5$, corresponding to a propagation loss of 2.4 dB/cm. These results serve as a critical step towards developing future large-scale, low-loss photonic integrated circuits based on ScAlN.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second harmonic generation in high-$Q$ all-dielectric metasurfaces with backward frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we employ the quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonance in all-dielectric metasurfaces for efficient nonlinear processes in consideration of the backward frequency conversion. We theoretically study the second-harmonic generation (SHG) from symmetry-broken AlGaAs metasurfaces and reveal the efficiency enhancement empowered by high-$Q$ quasi-BIC resonances. By introducing the correction term of nonlinear polarization at the fundamental wave field to the conventional undepleted approximation, we uncover the effect of backward frequency conversion on the nonlinear conversation efficiency. The SHG efficiency as $2.45\times10^{-2}$ with the developed depleted model, shows a $14.3\%$ decrease compared with $2.86\times10^{-2}$ in conventional undepleted approximation, under the incident intensity of 10 MW/cm$^{2}$. Our results are of significant importance for designing efficient nonlinear metasurfaces supporting high-$Q$ resonances.</description>

      <title>Chiral-induced angular momentum radiation in single molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study angular momentum radiation from electrically-biased chiral single molecular junctions using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. Using single helical chains as examples, we make connections between the ability of a chiral molecule to emit photons with angular momentum to the geometrical factors of the molecule. We point out that the mechanism studied here does not involve the magnetic moment. Rather, it relies on inelastic transitions between scattering states originated from two electrodes with different chiral properties and chemical potentials. The required time-reversal symmetry breaking is provided by nonequilibrium electron transport. Our work sheds light on the relationship between geometrical and optoelectrical chiral properties at single molecular limit.</description>

      <title>5.0 $\mu$m emitting Interband Cascade Lasers with Superlattice and Bulk AlGaAsSb Claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19165v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparison between interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with a 6-stage active region emitting at 5 $\mu$m with AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings and with bulk Al_0.85 Ga_0.15 As_0.07 Sb_0.93 claddings. Utilizing bulk AlGaAsSb claddings with their lower refractive index compared to the more commonly used AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings, the mode-confinement in the active region increases by 14.4% resulting in an improvement of the lasing threshold current density. For broad area laser and under pulsed excitation, the ICL with AlGaAsSb claddings shows a lower threshold current density of J_th=396 A/cm$^2$ compared to J_th=521 A/cm$^2$ for the reference ICL with superlattice claddings. Additionally, a higher characteristic temperature was obtained for the ICL with bulk claddings. A measured pulsed operation is observed up to 65 C.</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb interaction in the valley photogalvanic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the photogalvanic current of the carriers of charge in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric Dirac materials possessing a nontrivial structure of valleys and exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The valley photogalvanic effect occurs here due to the trigonal warping of electrons and holes' dispersions in a given valley of the monolayer. We study the low-frequency limit of the external field: The field frequency is smaller than the temperature $T$, and the electron-electron and electron-hole scattering times are much larger than the electron-impurity and hole-impurity scattering times. In this regime, we employ the Boltzmann transport equations and show that electron-hole scattering dominates electron-electron scattering in intrinsic semiconductors. A Coulomb electron-hole interaction-related contribution to the valley photogalvanic current can reduce the value of the bare photogalvanic current as electron and hole currents flow in opposite directions.</description>

      <title>Bright Heralded Source Reaching Theoretical Single-Photon Purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the theoretical limit of single-photon purity of heralded single-photon sources, and accordingly demonstrate a bright, gigahertz-pulsed heralded source with the purity saturating the limit. Based on spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon spiral waveguide, this on-chip source is measured to have a coincidence rate exceeding 1.5 MHz at a coincidence to accidental (CAR) ratio of 16.77. The single-photon purity, quantified by the auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_h(0)$, reaches the theoretical limit with the lowest value of $0.00094 \pm 0.00002$ obtained at a coincidence rate of 0.8 kHz. We attribute our results to effective spectral filtering as well as the coherent pump condition helped by optical injection locking.</description>
