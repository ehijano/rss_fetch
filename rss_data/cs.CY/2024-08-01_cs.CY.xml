      <title>Understanding Public Safety Trends in Calgary through data mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper utilizes statistical data from various open datasets in Calgary to to uncover patterns and insights for community crimes, disorders, and traffic incidents. Community attributes like demographics, housing, and pet registration were collected and analyzed through geospatial visualization and correlation analysis. Strongly correlated features were identified using the chi-square test, and predictive models were built using association rule mining and machine learning algorithms. The findings suggest that crime rates are closely linked to factors such as population density, while pet registration has a smaller impact. This study offers valuable insights for city managers to enhance community safety strategies.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) in Health Data Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores the essential role of Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) in managing and facilitating secure health data transfers within corporate groups under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). BCRs are tailored to ensure compliance with the GDPR and similar international data protection laws, presenting a flexible mechanism for transferring sensitive health and genomic data. The chapter situates BCRs within the broader spectrum of the GDPR international data transfer mechanisms, addressing the unique challenges posed by the sensitive nature of health data and the increased adoption of AI technologies. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) Recommendations 1/2022 on BCRs, issued following the Schrems II decision, are critically analyzed, highlighting their stringent requirements and the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes data protection and an AI governance framework. The chapter outlines the BCR approval process, stressing the importance of streamlining this process to encourage broader adoption. It underscores the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach in developing BCRs, incorporating recently adopted international standards and frameworks, which offer valuable guidance for organizations to build trustworthy AI management systems. They guarantee the ethical development, deployment, and operation of AI, which is essential for its successful integration and the broader digital transformation. In conclusion, BCRs are positioned as essential tools for secure health data management, fostering transparency, accountability, and collaboration across international borders. The chapter calls for proactive measures to incentivize BCR adoption, streamline approval processes, and promote more innovative approaches, ensuring BCRs remain a robust mechanism for global data protection and compliance.</description>

      <title>Does the Source of a Warning Matter? Examining the Effectiveness of Veracity Warning Labels Across Warners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted an online, between-subjects experiment (N = 2,049) to better understand the impact of warning label sources on information trust and sharing intentions. Across four warners (the social media platform, other social media users, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and fact checkers), we found that all significantly decreased trust in false information relative to control, but warnings from AI were modestly more effective. All warners significantly decreased the sharing intentions of false information, except warnings from other social media users. AI was again the most effective. These results were moderated by prior trust in media and the information itself. Most noteworthy, we found that warning labels from AI were significantly more effective than all other warning labels for participants who reported a low trust in news organizations, while warnings from AI were no more effective than any other warning label for participants who reported a high trust in news organizations.</description>

      <title>ERIT Lightweight Multimodal Dataset for Elderly Emotion Recognition and Multimodal Fusion Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ERIT is a novel multimodal dataset designed to facilitate research in a lightweight multimodal fusion. It contains text and image data collected from videos of elderly individuals reacting to various situations, as well as seven emotion labels for each data sample. Because of the use of labeled images of elderly users reacting emotionally, it is also facilitating research on emotion recognition in an underrepresented age group in machine learning visual emotion recognition. The dataset is validated through comprehensive experiments indicating its importance in neural multimodal fusion research.</description>

      <title>Zero Shot Health Trajectory Prediction Using Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating modern machine learning and clinical decision-making has great promise for mitigating healthcare's increasing cost and complexity. We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development and deployment in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Rolling in the deep of cognitive and AI biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, we delegate many of our decisions to Artificial Intelligence (AI) that acts either in solo or as a human companion in decisions made to support several sensitive domains, like healthcare, financial services and law enforcement. AI systems, even carefully designed to be fair, are heavily criticized for delivering misjudged and discriminated outcomes against individuals and groups. Numerous work on AI algorithmic fairness is devoted on Machine Learning pipelines which address biases and quantify fairness under a pure computational view. However, the continuous unfair and unjust AI outcomes, indicate that there is urgent need to understand AI as a sociotechnical system, inseparable from the conditions in which it is designed, developed and deployed. Although, the synergy of humans and machines seems imperative to make AI work, the significant impact of human and societal factors on AI bias is currently overlooked. We address this critical issue by following a radical new methodology under which human cognitive biases become core entities in our AI fairness overview. Inspired by the cognitive science definition and taxonomy of human heuristics, we identify how harmful human actions influence the overall AI lifecycle, and reveal human to AI biases hidden pathways. We introduce a new mapping, which justifies the human heuristics to AI biases reflections and we detect relevant fairness intensities and inter-dependencies. We envision that this approach will contribute in revisiting AI fairness under deeper human-centric case studies, revealing hidden biases cause and effects.</description>

      <title>SmileyNet -- Towards the Prediction of the Lottery by Reading Tea Leaves with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SmileyNet, a novel neural network with psychic abilities. It is inspired by the fact that a positive mood can lead to improved cognitive capabilities including classification tasks. The network is hence presented in a first phase with smileys and an encouraging loss function is defined to bias it into a good mood. SmileyNet is then used to forecast the flipping of a coin based on an established method of Tasseology, namely by reading tea leaves. Training and testing in this second phase are done with a high-fidelity simulation based on real-world pixels sampled from a professional tea-reading cup. SmileyNet has an amazing accuracy of 72% to correctly predict the flip of a coin. Resnet-34, respectively YOLOv5 achieve only 49%, respectively 53%. It is then shown how multiple SmileyNets can be combined to win the lottery.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the influence of perceived AI features on user motivation in virtual interactions. AI avatars, being disclosed as being an AI, or embodying specific genders, could be used in user-AI interactions. Leveraging insights from AI and avatar research, we explore how AI disclosure and gender affect user motivation. We conducted a game-based experiment involving over 72,500 participants who solved search problems alone or with an AI companion. Different groups experienced varying AI appearances and disclosures. We measured play intensity. Results revealed that the presence of another avatar led to less intense play compared to solo play. Disclosure of the avatar as AI heightened effort intensity compared to non-disclosed AI companions. Additionally, a masculine AI appearance reduced effort intensity.</description>

      <title>Assessing the State of AI Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has accelerated rapidly. AI enabled technologies are facing the public in many ways including infrastructure, consumer products and home applications. Because many of these technologies present risks either in the form of physical injury, or bias, potentially yielding unfair outcomes, policy makers must consider the need for oversight. Most policymakers, however, lack the technical knowledge to judge whether an emerging AI technology is safe, effective, and requires oversight, therefore policy makers must depend on expert opinion. But policymakers are better served when, in addition to expert opinion, they have some general understanding of existing guidelines and regulations. This work provides an overview [the landscape] of AI legislation and directives at the international, U.S. state, city and federal levels. It also reviews relevant business standards, and technical society initiatives. Then an overlap and gap analysis are performed resulting in a reference guide that includes recommendations and guidance for future policy making.</description>

      <title>Safetywashing: Do AI Safety Benchmarks Actually Measure Safety Progress?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems grow more powerful, there has been increasing interest in "AI safety" research to address emerging and future risks. However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and inconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can contribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship between AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general knowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with upstream model capabilities, potentially enabling "safetywashing" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements. Based on these findings, we propose an empirical foundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety in a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research goals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In doing so, we aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research, advancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards measurable progress.</description>

      <title>In-class Data Analysis Replications: Teaching Students while Testing Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Science is facing a reproducibility crisis. Previous work has proposed incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students, educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve the state of science?
  In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL (N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities, such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward.
  Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and students.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Success of Computer Science Professors and Students Based on Their Academic and Personal Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After completing their undergraduate studies, many computer science (CS) students apply for competitive graduate programs in North America. Their long-term goal is often to be hired by one of the big five tech companies or to become a faculty member. Therefore, being aware of the role of admission criteria may help them choose the best path towards their goals. In this paper, we analyze the influence of students' previous universities on their chances of being accepted to prestigious North American universities and returning to academia as professors in the future. Our findings demonstrate that the ranking of their prior universities is a significant factor in achieving their goals. We then illustrate that there is a bias in the undergraduate institutions of students admitted to the top 25 computer science programs. Finally, we employ machine learning models to forecast the success of professors at these universities. We achieved an RMSE of 7.85 for this prediction task.</description>

      <title>Human vs. Machine: Behavioral Differences Between Expert Humans and Language Models in Wargame Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To some, the advent of AI promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness while reducing the influence of human error and emotions. However, there is still debate about how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) that can be applied to many tasks, behave compared to humans in high-stakes military decision-making scenarios with the potential for increased risks towards escalation and unnecessary conflicts. To test this potential and scrutinize the use of LLMs for such purposes, we use a new wargame experiment with 107 national security experts designed to examine crisis escalation in a fictional US-China scenario and compare the behavior of human player teams to LLM-simulated team responses in separate simulations. Here, we find that the LLM-simulated responses can be more aggressive and significantly affected by changes in the scenario. We show a considerable high-level agreement in the LLM and human responses and significant quantitative and qualitative differences in individual actions and strategic tendencies. These differences depend on intrinsic biases in LLMs regarding the appropriate level of violence following strategic instructions, the choice of LLM, and whether the LLMs are tasked to decide for a team of players directly or first to simulate dialog between a team of players. When simulating the dialog, the discussions lack quality and maintain a farcical harmony. The LLM simulations cannot account for human player characteristics, showing no significant difference even for extreme traits, such as "pacifist" or "aggressive sociopath." When probing behavioral consistency across individual moves of the simulation, the tested LLMs deviated from each other but generally showed somewhat consistent behavior. Our results motivate policymakers to be cautious before granting autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.</description>

      <title>Toward Automated Detection of Biased Social Signals from the Content of Clinical Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit bias can impede patient-provider interactions and lead to inequities in care. Raising awareness is key to reducing such bias, but its manifestations in the social dynamics of patient-provider communication are difficult to detect. In this study, we used automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to identify social signals in patient-provider interactions. We built an automated pipeline to predict social signals from audio recordings of 782 primary care visits that achieved 90.1% average accuracy across codes, and exhibited fairness in its predictions for white and non-white patients. Applying this pipeline, we identified statistically significant differences in provider communication behavior toward white versus non-white patients. In particular, providers expressed more patient-centered behaviors towards white patients including more warmth, engagement, and attentiveness. Our study underscores the potential of automated tools in identifying subtle communication signals that may be linked with bias and impact healthcare quality and equity.</description>

      <title>Explainable Natural Language Processing for Corporate Sustainability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sustainability commonly refers to entities, such as individuals, companies, and institutions, having a non-detrimental (or even positive) impact on the environment, society, and the economy. With sustainability becoming a synonym of acceptable and legitimate behaviour, it is being increasingly demanded and regulated. Several frameworks and standards have been proposed to measure the sustainability impact of corporations, including United Nations' sustainable development goals and the recently introduced global sustainability reporting framework, amongst others. However, the concept of corporate sustainability is complex due to the diverse and intricate nature of firm operations (i.e. geography, size, business activities, interlinks with other stakeholders). As a result, corporate sustainability assessments are plagued by subjectivity both within data that reflect corporate sustainability efforts (i.e. corporate sustainability disclosures) and the analysts evaluating them. This subjectivity can be distilled into distinct challenges, such as incompleteness, ambiguity, unreliability and sophistication on the data dimension, as well as limited resources and potential bias on the analyst dimension. Put together, subjectivity hinders effective cost attribution to entities non-compliant with prevailing sustainability expectations, potentially rendering sustainability efforts and its associated regulations futile. To this end, we argue that Explainable Natural Language Processing (XNLP) can significantly enhance corporate sustainability analysis. Specifically, linguistic understanding algorithms (lexical, semantic, syntactic), integrated with XAI capabilities (interpretability, explainability, faithfulness), can bridge gaps in analyst resources and mitigate subjectivity problems within data.</description>

Abstract: The scientific method is the cornerstone of human progress across all branches of the natural and applied sciences, from understanding the human body to explaining how the universe works. The scientific method is based on identifying systematic rules or principles that describe the phenomenon of interest in a reproducible way that can be validated through experimental evidence. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), there are discussions on how AI systems may discover new knowledge. We argue that human complex reasoning for scientific discovery remains of vital importance, at least before the advent of artificial general intelligence. Yet, AI can be leveraged for scientific discovery via explainable AI. More specifically, knowing what data AI systems deemed important to make decisions can be a point of contact with domain experts and scientists, that can lead to divergent or convergent views on a given scientific problem. Divergent views may spark further scientific investigations leading to new scientific knowledge.</description>

Abstract: Crime situations are race against time. An AI-assisted criminal investigation system, providing prompt but precise legal counsel is in need for police officers. We introduce LAPIS (Language Model Augmented Police Investigation System), an automated system that assists police officers to perform rational and legal investigative actions. We constructed a finetuning dataset and retrieval knowledgebase specialized in crime investigation legal reasoning task. We extended the dataset's quality by incorporating manual curation efforts done by a group of domain experts. We then finetuned the pretrained weights of a smaller Korean language model to the newly constructed dataset and integrated it with the crime investigation knowledgebase retrieval approach. Experimental results show LAPIS' potential in providing reliable legal guidance for police officers, even better than the proprietary GPT-4 model. Qualitative analysis on the rationales generated by LAPIS demonstrate the model's reasoning ability to leverage the premises and derive legally correct conclusions.</description>
