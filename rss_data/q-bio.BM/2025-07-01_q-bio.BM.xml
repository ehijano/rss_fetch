      <title>Resolving structural dynamics in situ through cryogenic electron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the structural heterogeneity of proteins and their complexes, offering insights into macromolecular dynamics directly within cells. Driven by recent computational advances, including powerful machine learning frameworks, researchers can now resolve both discrete structural states and continuous conformational changes from 3D subtomograms and stacks of 2D particle-images acquired across tilt-series. In this review, we survey recent innovations in particle classification and heterogeneous 3D reconstruction methods, focusing specifically on the relative merits of workflows that operate on reconstructed 3D subtomogram volumes compared to those using extracted 2D particle-images. We additionally highlight how these methods have provided specific biological insights into the organization, dynamics, and structural variability of cellular components. Finally, we advocate for the development of benchmarking datasets collected in vitro and in situ to enable a more objective comparison of existent and emerging methods for particle classification and heterogeneous 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Rotational Dynamics of ATP Synthase: Mechanical Constraints and Energy Dissipative Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton motive force (PMF) across the inner mitochondrial membrane delivers approximately 0.2 eV of energy per proton, powering the FoF1-ATP synthase molecular motor. Here, we provide a detailed accounting of how this energy is utilized: Approximately 75-83% is transduced into the chemical free energy of ATP synthesis, while the remaining 17-25% is dissipated through internal friction, viscous drag, proton leakage, electroviscous effects, elastic deformations, and information-theoretic costs. Each dissipation channel is quantitatively evaluated, revealing that internal friction in the F1 motor is the dominant loss mechanism. In this work, we did not account for the energy supplied/injected due to the intrinsic electrostatic potential of the enzyme itself. In addition to this energy bookkeeping, we also examine the quantum mechanical constraints on the Fo unit's rotation. We find that, as can be expected, the energy spacing between quantized rotational states is several orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energies at physiological temperature, and that the tunneling probability through rotational barriers practically totally non-existent. Furthermore, the biological rotation speed (100-650 revolutions per second (rps)) is between one and three orders of magnitude below the quantum limit implied by quantization of angular momentum of the c-ring (which would have been ca. 13,000 to 62,000 rps (depending on the size of the c-ring (17 to 8 subunits, respectively)) in the first rotational energy level of the c-ring). Nevertheless, experimental estimates of the rotation rates in isolated c-ring suggest rates in the vicinity of 43,000 rps, right within our theoretical quantum estimates. However, ATP synthase as a whole operates firmly within the classical regime, despite its nanoscale dimensions, and highlight its evolutionary optimization for robust and efficient energy conversion....</description>

      <title>Actively induced supercoiling can slow down plasmid solutions by trapping the threading entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22842</link>

Abstract: Harnessing the topology of ring polymers as a design motif in functional nanomaterials is becoming a promising direction in the field of soft matter. For example, the ring topology of DNA plasmids prevents the relaxation of excess twist introduced to the polymer, instead resulting in helical supercoiled structures. In equilibrium semi-dilute solutions, tightly supercoiled rings relax faster than their torsionally relaxed counterparts, since the looser conformations of the latter allow for rings to thread through each other and entrain via entanglements. Here we use molecular simulations to explore a non-equilibrium scenario, in which a supercoiling agent, akin to gyrase enzymes, rapidly induces supercoiling in the suspensions of relaxed plasmids. The activity of the agent not only alters the conformational topology from open to branched, but also locks-in threaded rings into supramolecular clusters, which relax very slowly. Ultimately, our work shows how the polymer topology under non-equilibrium conditions can be leveraged to tune dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems, suggesting a pathway to novel class of driven materials glassified by activity.</description>

      <title>Missing-Modality-Aware Graph Neural Network for Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients. Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET (Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at https://github.com/SinaTabakhi/MAGNET.</description>
