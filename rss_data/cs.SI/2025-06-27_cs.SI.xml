      <title>Establishing validated standards for Home and Work location Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphone location data have transformed urban mobility research, providing unprecedented insights into how people navigate and interact in cities. However, leveraging location data at scale presents methodological challenges. Accurately identifying individuals' home and work locations is critical for a range of applications, including commuting analysis, unemployment estimation, and urban accessibility studies. Despite their widespread use, home-work detection methods lack a standardized framework that accounts for differing data quality and that is validated against ground-truth observations. This limits the comparability and reproducibility of results across studies and datasets. In this paper, we present HoWDe, a robust algorithm for identifying home and work locations from mobility data, explicitly designed to handle missing data and varying data quality across individuals. Using two unique ground-truth datasets comprising over 5100 individuals from more than 80 countries, HoWDe achieves home and work detection accuracies of up to 97% and 88%, respectively, with consistent performance across countries and demographic groups. We examine how parameter choices shape the trade-off between accuracy and user retention, and demonstrate how these methodological decisions influence downstream applications such as employment estimation and commuting pattern analysis. By supporting in-house pre-processing through a transparent and validated pipeline, HoWDe also facilitates the sharing of privacy-preserving mobility data. Together, our tools and findings establish methodological standards that support more robust, scalable, and reproducible mobility research at both individual and urban scales.</description>

      <title>Malicious earworms and useful memes, how the far-right surfs on TikTok audio trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its features of remix, TikTok is the designated platform for meme-making and dissemination. Creative combinations of video, emoji, and filters allow for an endless stream of memes and trends animated by sound. The platform has focused its moderation on upholding physical safety, hence investing in the detection of harmful challenges. In response to the DSA, TikTok implemented opt-outs for personalized feeds and features allowing users to report illegal content. At the same time, the platform remains subject to scrutiny. Centering on the role of sound and its intersections with ambiguous memes, the presented research probed right-wing extremist formations relating to the 2024 German state elections. The analysis evidences how the TikTok sound infrastructure affords a sustained presence of xenophobic content, often cloaked through vernacular modes of communication. These cloaking practices benefit from a sound infrastructure that affords the ongoing posting of user-generated sounds that instantly spread through the use-this-sound button. Importantly, these sounds are often not clearly recognizable as networkers of extremist content. Songs that do contain hateful lyrics are not eligible for personalized feeds, however, they remain online where they profit from intersecting with benign meme trends, rendering them visible in search results.</description>

      <title>Where is AIED Headed? Key Topics and Emerging Frontiers (2020-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze 2,398 research articles published between 2020 and 2024 across eight core venues related to the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED). Using a three-step knowledge co-occurrence network analysis, we analyze the knowledge structure of the field, the evolving knowledge clusters, and the emerging frontiers. Our findings reveal that AIED research remains strongly technically focused, with sustained themes such as intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and natural language processing, alongside rising interest in large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). By tracking the bridging keywords over the past five years, we identify four emerging frontiers in AIED--LLMs, GenAI, multimodal learning analytics, and human-AI collaboration. The current research interests in GenAI are centered around GAI-driven personalization, self-regulated learning, feedback, assessment, motivation, and ethics.The key research interests and emerging frontiers in AIED reflect a growing emphasis on co-adaptive, human-centered AI for education. This study provides the first large-scale field-level mapping of AIED's transformation in the GenAI era and sheds light on the future research development and educational practices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Homophily-Heterophily Separation: Relation-Aware Learning in Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks usually have a property of node heterophily, that is, the connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various downstream tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/zhengziyu77/RASH.</description>

      <title>Institutional Noise, Strategic Deviation, and Intertemporal Collapse: A Formal Model of Miner Behaviour under Protocol Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a formal game-theoretic model to examine how protocol mutability disrupts cooperative mining behaviour in blockchain systems. Using a repeated game framework with stochastic rule shocks, we show that even minor uncertainty in institutional rules increases time preference and induces strategic deviation. Fixed-rule environments support long-term investment and stable equilibrium strategies; in contrast, mutable protocols lead to short-termism, higher discounting, and collapse of coordinated engagement. Simulation results identify instability zones in the parameter space where rational mining gives way to extractive or arbitrage conduct. These findings support an Austrian economic interpretation: calculability requires rule stability. Institutional noise undermines the informational basis for productive action. We conclude that protocol design must be treated as a constitutional economic constraint, not a discretionary variable, if sustainable cooperation is to emerge in decentralised systems.</description>

      <title>Evolution and determinants of firm-level systemic risk in local production networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have exposed vulnerabilities and caused disruptions of supply chains, leading to product shortages, increased costs, and economic instability. This has prompted increasing efforts to assess systemic risk, namely the effects of firm disruptions on entire economies. However, the ability of firms to react to crises by rewiring their supply links has been largely overlooked, limiting our understanding of production networks resilience. Here we study dynamics and determinants of firm-level systemic risk in the Hungarian production network from 2015 to 2022. We use as benchmark a heuristic maximum entropy null model that generates an ensemble of production networks at equilibrium, by preserving the total input (demand) and output (supply) of each firm at the sector level. We show that the fairly stable set of firms with highest systemic risk undergoes a structural change during COVID-19, as those enabling economic exchanges become key players in the economy -- a result which is not reproduced by the null model. Although the empirical systemic risk aligns well with the null value until the onset of the pandemic, it becomes significantly smaller afterwards as the adaptive behavior of firms leads to a more resilient economy. Furthermore, firms' international trade volume (being a subject of disruption) becomes a significant predictor of their systemic risk. However, international links cannot provide an unequivocal explanation for the observed trends, as imports and exports have opposing effects on local systemic risk through the supply and demand channels.</description>

      <title>A systematic comparison of measures for publishing k-anonymous social network data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharing or publishing social network data while accounting for privacy of individuals is a difficult task due to the interconnectedness of nodes in networks. A key question in k-anonymity, a widely studied notion of privacy, is how to measure the anonymity of an individual, as this determines the attacker scenarios one protects against. In this paper, we systematically compare the most prominent anonymity measures from the literature in terms of the completeness and reach of the structural information they take into account. We present a theoretical characterization and a distance-parametrized strictness ordering of the existing measures for k-anonymity in networks. In addition, we conduct empirical experiments on a wide range of real-world network datasets with up to millions of edges. Our findings reveal that the choice of the measure significantly impacts the measured level of anonymity and hence the effectiveness of the corresponding attacker scenario, the privacy vs. utility trade-off, and computational cost. Surprisingly, we find that the anonymity measure representing the most effective attacker scenario considers a greater node vicinity yet utilizes only limited structural information and therewith minimal computational resources. Overall, the insights provided in this work offer researchers and practitioners practical guidance for selecting appropriate anonymity measures when sharing or publishing social network data under privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>Schelling segregation dynamics in densely-connected social network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schelling segregation is a well-established model used to investigate the dynamics of segregation in agent-based models. Since we consider segregation to be key for the development of political polarisation, we are interested in what insights it could give for this problem. We tested basic questions of segregation on an agent-based social network model where agents' connections were not restricted by their spatial position, and made the network graph much denser than previous tests of Schelling segregation in social networks.
  We found that a dense social network does not become as strongly segregated as a sparse network, and that agents' numbers of same-group neighbours do not greatly exceed their desired numbers (i.e. they do not end up more segregated than they desire to be). Furthermore, we found that the network was very difficult to polarise when one group was somewhat smaller than the other, and that the network became unstable when one group was extremely small; both phenomena may help explain the complexity of real-world polarisation dynamics, such as unique risks faced by very small group sin a society. Finally we tested Fossett's (2006) "paradox of weak minority preferences", a well-established result in grid- and map-based models which shows that an increase in the minority group's desire for same-group neighbours can create more segregation than a similar increase for the majority group. In a densely connected social network, we find that the evidence for this effect is mixed.</description>

      <title>L-2 Regularized maximum likelihood for $\beta$-model in large and sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11856v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\beta$-model is a powerful tool for modeling large and sparse networks driven by degree heterogeneity, where many network models become infeasible due to computational challenge and network sparsity. However, existing estimation algorithms for $\beta$-model do not scale up. Also, theoretical understandings remain limited to dense networks. This paper brings several significant improvements over existing results to address the urgent needs of practice. We propose a new $\ell_2$-penalized MLE algorithm that can comfortably handle sparse networks of millions of nodes with much-improved memory parsimony. We establish the first rate-optimal error bounds and high-dimensional asymptotic normality results for $\beta$-models, under much weaker network sparsity assumptions than best existing results.
  Application of our method to large COVID-19 network data sets discovered meaningful results.</description>

      <title>Triadic Novelty: A Typology and Measurement Framework for Recognizing Novel Contributions in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress depends on novel ideas, but current reward systems often fail to recognize them. Many existing metrics conflate novelty with popularity, privileging ideas that fit existing paradigms over those that challenge them. This study develops a theory-driven framework to better understand how different types of novelty emerge, take hold, and receive recognition. Drawing on network science and theories of discovery, we introduce a triadic typology: Pioneers, who introduce entirely new topics; Mavericks, who recombine distant concepts; and Vanguards, who reinforce weak but promising connections. We apply this typology to a dataset of 41,623 articles in the interdisciplinary field of philanthropy and nonprofit studies, linking novelty types to five-year citation counts using mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Results show that novelty is not uniformly rewarded. Pioneer efforts are foundational but often overlooked. Maverick novelty shows consistent citation benefits, particularly rewarded when it displaces prior focus. Vanguard novelty is more likely to gain recognition when it strengthens weakly connected topics, but its citation advantage diminishes as those reinforced nodes become more central. To enable fair comparison across time and domains, we introduce a simulated baseline model. These findings improve the evaluation of innovations, affecting science policy, funding, and institutional assessment practices.</description>
