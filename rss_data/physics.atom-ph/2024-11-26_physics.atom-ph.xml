      <title>Theory of internal conversion of the thorium-229 nuclear isomer in solid-state hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser excitation of thorium-229 nuclei in doped wide bandgap crystals has been demonstrated recently, opening the possibility of developing ultrastable solid-state clocks and sensitive searches for new physics. We develop a quantitative theory of the internal conversion of isomeric thorium-229 in solid-state hosts. The internal conversion of the isomer proceeds by resonantly exciting a valence band electron to a defect state, accompanied by multi-phonon emission. We demonstrate that, if the process is energetically allowed, it generally quenches the isomer on timescales much faster than the isomer's radiative lifetime, despite thorium being in the +4 charge state in the valence band.</description>

      <title>Ro-vibrational quenching calculations of C$_2^-$ in collision with H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular anion C$_2^-$ has been of interest in the last few years as a candidate for laser cooling due to its electronic structure and favourable branching ratios to the ground electronic and vibrational state. Molecular hydrogen has been used by the Wester group in Innsbruck as a buffer gas to cool the molecule's internal ro-vibrational motion. In the present work, we generate a new, five dimensional (5D) interaction potential for the system by considering the H$_2$ as a rigid rotor and the C$_2^-$ as a rotating-vibrating diatomic molecule. We thereafter calculate the cross sections and rate coefficients for ro-vibrational inelastic collisions of C$_2^-$ with both para- and ortho-H$_2$ on this new 5D \textit{ab initio} potential energy surface using quantum scattering theory for the dynamics. The rates for vibrational quenching are obtained over the range of temperatures which covers the single value measured by the experiments. A comparison is also made with the earlier results using a simpler 3D interaction potential. Furthermore, para-H$_2$ is found to be more efficient than ortho-H$_2$ (with or without undergoing rotational excitation) in cooling C$_2^-$. The rate coefficients for cooling the anions has been computed by appropriately weighting the ortho- and para-H$_2$ and compared with the available experimental result at 20 K. When the vibrational de-excitation rate coefficients are taken to be the ones not causing any concurrent rotational excitations in the final C$_2^-$ anions, the properly averaged results are found to get smaller and to become very close to the experimental measurements. The implications of these new results for laser cooling of C$_2^-$ are analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Two-photon cooling of calcium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of calcium atoms using a two-photon transition from the ${^1}S_0$ ground state to the upper $4s5s~{^1}S_0$ state via the ${^1}P_1$ intermediate state. We achieve temperatures as low as $260~\mu\text{K}$ in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), well below the Doppler limit ($T_{\text{D}} = 0.8~\text{mK}$) of the ${^1}P_1$ state. We characterize temperature, lifetime and confinement of the MOT over a range of experimental parameters, observing no reduction in lifetime due to coupling to the higher state. We perform theoretical simulations of the cooling scheme and observe good agreement with the experimental results. The two-photon cooling scheme presented in this work provides an alternative to the standard Doppler cooling applied to alkaline-earth atoms, based on a sequence of two magneto-optical traps. The advantages of our scheme are the possibility of varying the effective linewidth of the ${^1}P_1$ state, a higher transfer efficiency (close to 100$\%$), and a more straightforward experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Luminosity predictions for the first three ionisation stages of W, Pt and Au to probe potential sources of emission in kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large number of R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation for heavy elements (Z &gt; 70) have been performed in recent years for applications in fusion and astrophysics research. With the expanding interest in heavy ions due to kilonova (KN) events such as AT2017gfo and GRB230307A, this new data can be utilised for the diagnosis and study of observed KN spectra. In this work recently computed electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths are used, for the first three ionisation stages of tungsten (W, Z = 74), platinum (Pt, Z = 78) and gold (Au, Z = 79), to construct basic collisional radiative models tailored for the late stage nebular phases of KN. Line luminosities are calculated at a range of electron temperatures and densities and the strengths of these lines for a representative ion mass are compared. For the case of W III, these optically thin intensities are additionally used to constrain the mass of this ion in both AT2017gfo and GRB230307A. Comparing with theoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis yields from neutron star merger simulations, broad agreement with the inferred ion masses of W is found. Furthermore, we highlight the value of W measurements by showing that the abundance of other groups of elements and outflow properties are constrained by exploiting theoretically motivated correlations between the abundance of W and that of lanthanides or third r-process peak elements.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Photoelectrons in the Vicinity of Spectral Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown by Fano (1969) https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.178.131 that photoionization of a c{\ae}sium atom by a laser pulse tuned to the vicinity of a Cooper minimum generates spin-polarized electrons. Here we show that while photoionization of rare gases does not provide large spin polarization in the vicinity of the Cooper minimum, the Fano resonances yield much higher overall spin polarization ($\ge40\%$). The spin polarization increases in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and reaches $100\%$ when measured in coincidence with the photoion. We provide a general framework for achieving spin polarization in photoionization irrespective of the ionization regime.</description>

      <title>Domain formation and structural stabilities in mixed-species Coulomb crystals induced by sympathetically cooled highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in high-precision spectroscopy and frequency metrology for fundamental studies using sympathetically cooled highly charged ions (HCIs) embedded in Coulomb crystals of laser-cooled ions. In order to understand how their strong repulsion affects the crystal structure and dynamics, we study the thermal motion and rearrangement of small mixed linear and homogeneous crystals by both measurements and simulations. Co-crystallized HCIs form superlattices and divide the crystal into domains, where different reordering rates, melting points and localized phase transitions are observed due to decoupling of motional modes across boundaries. These results improve our understanding of homogeneous and inhomogeneous ion strings over a wide range of charge-to-mass ratios. This allows us to test our own simulations of the dynamic behavior of ion strings and gives us confidence in their suitability for applications related to quantum simulation as well as computing and the search for new physics.</description>

      <title>Spin structure of diatomic van der Waal molecules of alkali atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure of weakly bound diatomic van der Waals molecules formed by two identical bosonic alkali atoms. Our studies were performed using known Born-Oppenheimer potentials while developing a reduced interaction potential model. Such reduced potential models are currently a key for solving certain classes of few-body problems of atoms as they decrease the numerical burden on the computation. Although the reduced potentials are significantly shallower than actual Born-Oppenheimer potentials, they still capture the main properties of the near-threshold bound states, including their spin structure, and the scattering states over a broad range of magnetic fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that the variation in spin structure across different alkali species originates from the interplay between electronic spin exchange and hyperfine interactions. To characterize this competition we introduce a single parameter, which is a function of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths, the atomic hyperfine splitting constant, and the molecular binding energy. We show that this parameter can be used to classify the spin structure of vdW molecules for each atomic species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Anomalous high-density spin noise in a strongly interacting atomic vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin noise spectroscopy (SNS) has become a mainstream approach to probe the dynamics of a spin ensemble in and out of equilibrium. Current models describing spin noise in interacting samples are based on an effective single particle dynamics in a bath. Here, we report the observation of a strong interaction regime which significantly affects the spin dynamics. Performing SNS in a dense Rubidium vapor, we observe anomalous distortions of the usual spin noise spectra, which we attribute to resonant dipole-dipole interaction within the ensemble. As the density of the vapor increases, we observe a dramatic broadening of the usual resonances and the emergence of an unexpected extra low-frequency noise component. We use a simple microscopic two-body numerical model to reproduce and discuss these observations. Our results suggests that the spectra cannot be described by usual models of single-atom dynamics and arise from the evolution of interacting pair of atoms. This work opens the way to the study of many-body spin noise or higher order correlators in atomic vapors using SNS.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Diffraction Imaging of Electron Dynamics in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing the electron dynamics in four dimensions of space and time is crucial to the understanding of several ubiquitous processes in nature. Hence, ultrafast X-ray and electron imaging tools have been developed to probe the dynamics of matter by means of the time-resolved diffraction imaging (TRDI). In this work, we report an extension of the theory underlying the TRDI to the case of the laser-driven electron dynamics in solid state systems. We demonstrate that the TRDI signal encodes essential information about the time-dependent electron density of the system under study and thus makes it possible to decipher the ultrafast quantum dynamics and the electron transfer phenomena in solids. We apply the developed approach to image the laser-driven electron dynamics in neutral graphene showing that the predictions made by the fully quantum version of the TRDI deviate significantly from those obtained with the conventional semiclassical approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of an Optical Polarization State in a Polarization-Selective Nonlinear Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit polarization self-rotation in atomic rubidium vapor to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking and bistability of polarization patterns. We pump the vapor cell with horizontally polarized light while the vertical polarization, which is initially in the vacuum state, is resonated in a ring cavity. Vacuum fluctuations in this mode experience cumulative gain due to the compound action of amplification due to the self-rotation and feedback through the resonator, eventually acquiring a macroscopic magnitude akin to an optical parametric oscillator. The randomness of these fluctuations results in a bistable, random macroscopic polarization pattern at the output. We propose utilizing this mechanism to simulate Ising-like interaction between multiple spatial modes and as a basis for a fully optical coherent Ising machine.</description>
