      <title>Science cited in policy documents: Evidence from the Overton database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reflect the extent to which science is cited in policy documents, this paper explores the presence of policy document citations for over 18 million Web of Science-indexed publications published between 2010 and 2019. Enabled by the policy document citation data provided by Overton, a searchable index of policy documents worldwide, the results show that there are 3.9% of publications in the dataset cited at least once by policy documents. Policy document citations present a citation delay towards newly published publications and show a stronger predominance to the document types of review and article. Based on the Overton database, publications in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities have the highest relative presence in policy document citations, followed by Life and Earth Sciences and Biomedical and Health Sciences. Our findings shed light not only on the impact of scientific knowledge on the policy-making process, but also on the particular focus of policy documents indexed by Overton on specific research areas.</description>

      <title>The strain on scientific publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientists are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of articles being published. Total articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science have grown exponentially in recent years; in 2022 the article total was approximately ~47% higher than in 2016, which has outpaced the limited growth - if any - in the number of practising scientists. Thus, publication workload per scientist (writing, reviewing, editing) has increased dramatically. We define this problem as the strain on scientific publishing. To analyse this strain, we present five data-driven metrics showing publisher growth, processing times, and citation behaviours. We draw these data from web scrapes, requests for data from publishers, and material that is freely available through publisher websites. Our findings are based on millions of papers produced by leading academic publishers. We find specific groups have disproportionately grown in their articles published per year, contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by adopting a strategy of hosting special issues, which publish articles with reduced turnaround times. Given pressures on researchers to publish or perish to be competitive for funding applications, this strain was likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors coinciding with this strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such exponential growth cannot be sustained. The metrics we define here should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable solutions to address the strain on scientific publishing.</description>
