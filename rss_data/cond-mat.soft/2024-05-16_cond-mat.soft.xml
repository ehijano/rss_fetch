      <title>Evolving motility of active droplets is captured by a self-repelling random walk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swimming droplets are a class of active particles whose motility changes as a function of time due to shrinkage and self-avoidance of their trail. Here we combine experiments and theory to show that our non-Markovian droplet (NMD) model, akin to a true self-avoiding walk [1], quantitatively captures droplet motion. We thus estimate the effective temperature arising from hydrodynamic flows and the coupling strength of the propulsion force as a function of fuel concentration. This framework explains a broad range of phenomena, including memory effects, solute-mediated interactions, droplet hovering above the surface, and enhanced collective diffusion.</description>

      <title>Protein folding as a jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins fold to a specific functional conformation with a densely packed hydrophobic core that controls their stability. We develop a geometric, yet all-atom model for proteins that explains the universal core packing fraction of $\phi_c=0.55$ found in experimental measurements. We show that as the hydrophobic interactions increase relative to the temperature, a novel jamming transition occurs when the core packing fraction exceeds $\phi_c$. The model also recapitulates the global structure of proteins since it can accurately refold to native-like structures from partially unfolded states.</description>

      <title>On the selective formation of cubic tetrastack crystals from tetravalent patchy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving the formation of target open crystalline lattices from colloidal particles is of paramount importance for their potential application in photonics. Examples of such desired structures are the diamond, tetrastack, and pyrochlore lattices. Here, we demonstrate that the self-assembly of tetravalent patchy particles results in the selective formation of cubic tetrastack crystals, both in the bulk and in the systems subjected to external fields exerted by the solid substrate. It is demonstrated that the presence of an external field allows for the formation of well-defined single crystals with a low density of defects. Moreover, depending on the strength of the applied external field, the mechanism of epitaxial growth changes. For weakly attractive external fields, the crystallization occurs in a similar manner as in the bulk, since the fluid does not wet the substrate. Nonetheless, the formed crystal is considerably better ordered than the crystals formed in bulk, since the surface induces the ordering in the first layer. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the formation of well-ordered cubic tetrastack crystals is considerably enhanced by the increase in external field strength, and the formation of the thick crystalline film occurs via a series of layering transitions.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and morphology of proliferating cell collectives with self-inhibiting growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of proliferating cell collectives whose microscopic constituents' growth is inhibited by macroscopic growth-induced stress. Discrete particle simulations of a growing collective show the emergence of concentric-ring patterns in cell size whose spatio-temporal structure is closely tied to the individual cell's stress response. Motivated by these observations, we derive a multiscale continuum theory whose parameters map directly to the discrete model. Analytical solutions of this theory show the concentric patterns arise from anisotropically accumulated resistance to growth over many cell cycles. This work shows how purely mechanical processes can affect the internal patterning and morphology of cell collectives, and provides a concise theoretical framework for connecting the micro- to macroscopic dynamics of proliferating matter.</description>

      <title>Phase behavior of metastable water from large-scale simulations of a quantitative accurate model: The liquid-liquid critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water's unique anomalies are vital in various applications and biological processes, yet the molecular mechanisms behind these anomalies remain debated, particularly in the metastable liquid phase under supercooling and stretching conditions. Experimental challenges in these conditions have led to simulations suggesting a liquid-liquid phase transition between low-density and high-density water phases, culminating in a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP). However, these simulations are limited by computational expense, small system sizes, and reliability of water models. Using the FS model, we improve accuracy in predicting water's density and response functions across a broad range of temperatures and pressures. The FS model avoid by design first-order phase transitions towards crystalline phases, allowing thorough exploration of the metastable phase diagram. We employ advanced numerical techniques to bypass dynamical slowing down and perform finite-size scaling on systems significantly larger than those used in previous analyses. Our study extrapolates thermodynamic behavior in the infinite-system limit, accurately demonstrating the existence of the LLCP in the 3D Ising universality class at TC = 186 +/- 4 K and PC = 174 +/- 14 MPa, following a liquid-liquid phase separation below 200 MPa. These predictions align with recent experimental data and more sophisticated models, highlighting that hydrogen bond cooperativity governs the LLCP and the origin of water anomalies. Moreover, we observe that the hydrogen bond network exhibits substantial cooperative fluctuations at scales larger than 10 nm, even at temperatures relevant to biopreservation. These findings have significant implications for fields such as nanotechnology and biophysics, offering new insights into water's behavior under varied conditions.</description>

      <title>Effects of self-avoidance on the packing of stiff rods on ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a statistical-mechanics approach, we study the effects of geometry and self-avoidance on the ordering of slender filaments inside non-isotropic containers, considering cortical microtubules in plant cells, and packing of genetic material inside viral capsids as concrete examples. Within a mean-field approximation, we show analytically how the shape of the container, together with self-avoidance, affects the ordering of the stiff rods. We find that the strength of the self-avoiding interaction plays a significant role in the preferred packing orientation, leading to a first-order transition for oblate cells, where the preferred orientation changes from azimuthal, along the equator, to a polar one, when self-avoidance is strong enough. While for prolate spheroids the ground state is always a polar-like order, strong self-avoidance results with a deep meta-stable state along the equator. We compute the critical surface describing the transition between azimuthal and polar ordering in the three dimensional parameter space (persistence length, eccentricity, and self-avoidance) and show that the critical behavior of this system is in fact related to the butterfly catastrophe model. We calculate the pressure and shear stress applied by the filament on the surface, and the injection force needed to be applied on the filament in order to insert it into the volume. We compare these results to the pure mechanical study where self-avoidance is ignored, and discuss similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Oscillating edge current in polar active fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent behaviour called ``bacterial turbulence''. The behavior of the bulk unconstrained bacterial turbulence is described well by the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equation for the velocity field. However, it remains unclear how we should treat boundary conditions on bacterial turbulence in contact with some boundaries (e.g. solid walls). To be more specific, although the importance of the ``edge current'', the flow along the boundary, has been demonstrated in several experimental studies on confined bacterial suspensions, previous numerical studies based on the TTSH equation employ non-slip boundary conditions and do not seem to describe properly the behavior of bacteria near the boundaries. In this study, we impose a slip boundary condition on the TTSH equation to describe the bacterial motion at boundaries. We develop a method to implement the slip boundary condition. Using this method, we have successfully produced edge current and discovered that the direction of the edge current temporally oscillates. The oscillation can be attributable to the advection term in the TTSH equation. Our work demonstrates that boundary conditions could play an important role in the collective dynamics of active systems.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>
