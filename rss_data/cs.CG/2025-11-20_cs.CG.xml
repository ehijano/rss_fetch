      <title>A Dichotomy for 1-Planarity with Restricted Crossing Types Parameterized by Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A drawing of a graph is 1-planar if each edge participates in at most one crossing and adjacent edges do not cross. Up to symmetry, each crossing in a 1-planar drawing belongs to one out of six possible crossing types, where a type characterizes the subgraph induced by the four vertices of the crossing edges. Each of the 63 possible nonempty subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of crossing types gives a recognition problem: does a given graph admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, that is, a 1-planar drawing where the crossing type of each crossing is in $\mathcal{S}$?
  We show that there is a set $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$ with three crossing types and the following properties: If $\mathcal{S}$ contains no crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then the recognition of graphs that admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the treewidth of the input graph. If $\mathcal{S}$ contains any crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then it is NP-hard to decide whether a graph has an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, even when considering graphs of constant pathwidth.
  We also extend this characterization of crossing types to 1-planar straight-line drawings and show the same complexity behaviour parameterized by treewidth.</description>

      <title>How Hard is it to be a Star? Convex Geometry and the Real Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set is star-shaped if there is a point in the set that can see every other point in the set in the sense that the line-segment connecting the points lies within the set. We show that testing whether a non-empty compact smooth region is star-shaped is $\forall\mathbb{R}$-complete. Since the obvious definition of star-shapedness has logical form $\exists\forall$, this is a somewhat surprising result, based on Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}'s theorem from convex geometry; we study several related complexity classifications in the real hierarchy based on other results from convex geometry.</description>

      <title>Tighter Bounds for the Randomized Polynomial-Time Simplex Algorithm for Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a randomized polynomial-time simplex algorithm with higher probability and tighter bounds for linear programming by applying improved quasi-convex properties, a logarithmic rounding on a given polytope and its logarithmic perturbation. We base our work on the first randomized polynomial-time simplex method by Jonathan A. Kelner and Daniel A. Spielman [KS06].
  We obtain stronger bounds for the expected number of edges in the projection of a perturbed polytope onto a two-dimensional shadow plane. In the $k$-round case, we obtain a bound of $16 \sqrt{2} \pi k (1 + \lambda H_n) \sqrt{d} n / 3 \lambda$. In the non-$k$-round case, we obtain a bound of $26 \pi t (1 + \lambda H_n) \sqrt{d} n / \lambda \rho$. To achieve this, we provide a slightly lower bound of $3 \sqrt{2} \lambda / (16 n \sqrt{d})$ on the expected edge length that appears in the shadow. Another tool we employ is a tighter bound for $1$-quasi-concave minimization and $1$-quasi-convex maximization. In the $k$-round case, we obtain a quasi-convex bound of $(d - 2) \epsilon^2 / 2$. In the non-$k$-round case, we obtain a quasi-convex bound of $3.4 \epsilon^2 / \rho^2$.
  We propose a modification of the Kelner and Spielman randomized simplex algorithm (STOC'06) [KS06] that achieves a higher success probability. To accomplish this, we apply our tighter bounds with a new expected value of $\lambda = c \log n$ for independent exponentially distributed random variables and with $\log(k)$-rounding. The desired properties resulting from the construction of an artificial vertex during initialization hold with a higher probability of at least $1 - (d + 2), e^{-\log n}$. The pivot rule of the randomized simplex modification holds with a probability of at least $3/4$.</description>
