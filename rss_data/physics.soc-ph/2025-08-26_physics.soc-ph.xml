      <title>Social Identity in Human-Agent Interaction: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two facets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena. SIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one another socially, connecting the individual to the group through an understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour. SIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general offshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among people. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has spurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do participate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots powered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding the real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is crucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies and imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I emphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further argue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to be taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy, for our own good.</description>

      <title>Cyber Orbits of Large Scale Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of high-performance graph libraries, such as the GraphBLAS, has enabled the analysis of massive network data sets and revealed new models for their behavior. Physical analogies for complicated network behavior can be a useful aid to understanding these newly discovered network phenomena. Prior work leveraged the canonical Gull's Lighthouse problem and developed a computational heuristic for modeling large scale network traffic using this model. A general solution using this approach requires overcoming the essential mathematical singularities in the resulting differential equations. Further investigation reveals a simpler physical interpretation that alleviates the need for solving challenging differential equations. Specifically, that the probability of observing a source at a temporal ``distance'' $r(t)$ at time $t$ is $p(t) \propto 1/r(t)^2$. This analogy aligns with many physical phenomena and can be a rich source of intuition. Applying this physical analogy to the observed source correlations in the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge data leads to an elegant cyber orbit analogy that may assist with the understanding network behavior.</description>

      <title>Stability Optimization and Analysis of Energy Flow Networks versus Different Centrality Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the stability and control performance of complex networks often hinges on effectively identifying critical nodes for targeted intervention. Due to their inherent complexity and high dimensionality, large-scale energy flow networks, prevalent in domains like power grids, transportation, and financial systems, present unique challenges in selecting optimal nodes for resource allocation. While numerous centrality measurements, such as Katz centrality, eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank, have been proposed to evaluate node importance, the impact of different centrality metrics on stability outcomes remains inadequately understood. Moreover, networks manifest diverse structural characteristics-including small-world, scale-free, and random graph properties-which further complicates the optimization problem. This paper systematically investigates how various node centrality measurements influence control stability across representative complex network structures. A unified energy-flow dynamical model is developed, and performance metrics such as the L1 norm are employed to quantify the network stability implications of employing different centrality metrics. Extensive numerical simulations over statistically generated network ensembles reveal significant variances in stability outcomes, highlighting the crucial role of centrality selection. The findings underscore the sensitivity of energy-flow stability to seemingly minor changes in topological node rankings, providing practical insights for enhancing control efficiency and robustness in real-world networked systems.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Mobility Segregation: A Network Analysis of Racialized Flows in Pandemic-Era NYC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban segregation research has long relied on residential patterns, yet growing evidence suggests that racial/ethnic segregation also manifests systematically in mobility behaviors. Leveraging anonymized mobile device data from New York City before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a network-analytic framework to dissect mobility segregation in racialized flow networks. We examine citywide racial mixing patterns through mixing matrices and assortativity indices, revealing persistent diagonal dominance where intra-group flows constituted 69.27% of total movements. Crucially, we develop a novel dual-metric framework that reconceptualizes mobility segregation as two interlocking dimensions: structural segregation-passive exposure patterns driven by residential clustering, and preferential segregation-active homophily in mobility choices beyond spatial constraints. Our gravity-adjusted indices reveal that racial divisions transcend residential clustering-all racial groups exhibit active homophily after spatial adjustments, with particularly severe isolation during the pandemic. Findings highlight how pandemic restrictions disproportionately amplified asymmetric isolation, with minority communities experiencing steeper declines in access to White-dominated spaces. Finally, we propose a Homophily Gravity Model with racial similarity parameter, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy of race-specific mobility flows and more accurately reproduces intra-group mobility preferences and directional exposure patterns.Overall, this study redefines mobility segregation as a multidimensional phenomenon, where structural constraints, active preferences, and crisis responses compound to reshape urban racial inequality.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Analysis of Urban Pollutant-Weather Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ statistical physics and information-theoretic methods to quantify the dependencies between key atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables across multiple Indian cities. To capture both linear and nonlinear relationships, we introduce a Composite Correlation Index (CCI) that combines the Pearson correlation coefficient with entropy-based measures, including mutual information and conditional entropy. Based on the CCI values, cities are clustered into distinct groups, uncovering regional similarities in pollutant-meteorology interactions that may reflect shared climatic or environmental conditions. To explore temporal structure and causal dynamics, we analyze the relationship between particulate matter (PM2.5) and relative humidity (RH) using transfer entropy, which reveals a bidirectional flow of information in most locations. Further time-domain analysis via time-delayed mutual information shows that, in many cities, the dependence between PM2.5 and RH peaks at zero lag and decays exponentially thereafter, indicating predominantly contemporaneous interactions with limited memory. This integrative framework provides a robust approach to characterizing atmospheric interaction regimes, bridging statistical physics with environmental complexity and revealing new insights into the pollutant-meteorology dynamics.</description>

      <title>AI Data Centers Need Pioneers to Deliver Scalable Power via Offgrid AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalable computing revolution of the late '80s through mid- '00s forged a new technical and economic model for computing that delivered massive societal impact, but its economic benefit has driven scalability to sizes that are now exhausting the energy grid's capacity. Our time demands a new revolution in scalable energy, mirroring in key ways the scalable computing revolution; e.g., compelling economic forces, use of mass-market components, overcoming foibles of those components, judicious use of physical locality, and the the difficult integration into an effective system. The offgrid AI approach closely fits this mold, combining local mostly renewable generation and storage to power an AI data center, starting offgrid. Obstacles to delivering this approach are social, technical, and project, but the potential is massive. I argue that the offgrid-AI approach needs pioneers among both system developers and AI-data-center operators to move it quickly from concept to large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>How does node centrality in a financial network affect asset price prediction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex financial networks, systemically important nodes usually play crucial roles. Asset price forecasting is important for describing the evolution of a financial network. Naturally, the question arises as to whether node centrality impacts the effectiveness of price forecasting. To explore this, we examine networks composed of major global assets and investigate how node centrality affects price forecasting using a hybrid random forest algorithm. Our findings reveal two counterintuitive phenomena: (i) factors with low centrality usually have better forecasting ability, and (ii) nodes with low centrality can be predicted more accurately in direction. These unexpected observations can be explained from the perspective of information theory. Moreover, our research suggests a criterion for factor selection: when predicting an asset price in a complex system, factors with low centrality should be selected rather than only factors with high centrality. Finally, we verify the robustness of our results using an alternative deep learning method.</description>

      <title>Self-reinforcing cascades: A spreading model for beliefs or products of varying intensity or quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of how things spread often assume that transmission mechanisms are fixed over time. However, social contagions--the spread of ideas, beliefs, innovations--can lose or gain in momentum as they spread: ideas can get reinforced, beliefs strengthened, products refined. We study the impacts of such self-reinforcement mechanisms in cascade dynamics. We use different mathematical modeling techniques to capture the recursive, yet changing nature of the process. We find a critical regime with a range of power-law cascade size distributions with non-universal scaling exponents. This regime clashes with classic models, where criticality requires fine tuning at a precise critical point. Self-reinforced cascades produce critical-like behavior over a wide range of parameters, which may help explain the ubiquity of power-law distributions in empirical social data.</description>

      <title>Planning for future EV charging infrastructure: A city-scale assessment of demand and capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the global shift toward transportation electrification has accelerated, capacity planning for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has become a critical challenge in the development of low-carbon urban energy systems. This study proposes the first demand-driven, multi-objective planning model for optimizing city-scale capacity allocation of EV charging infrastructure. The model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a rapidly expanding EV hub in China with a strong industrial base, supportive policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from 18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide (ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2, driven primarily by BEVs; (2) 181,622 additional charging piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, concentrated in densely populated areas, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes population density over geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area, the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic, geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</description>
