      <title>Inferring Hidden Motives: Bayesian Models of Preference Learning in Repeated Dictator Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cooperation depends on how accurately we infer others' motives--how much they value fairness, generosity, or self-interest from the choices they make. We model that process in binary dictator games, which isolate moral trade-offs between self and other stripped of strategic complexity. Participants observed others' allocation decisions and predicted their future behavior while playing through an exhaustive, randomized payoff space implemented on The Morality Game platform. We formalize social-preference learning as Bayesian belief updating over continuous parameters such as self-interest, altruism, envy, and guilt. The resulting Utility Bayesian Model (UBM) outperformed non-Bayesian alternatives and Bayesian models that categorize others into discrete social types. Because Bayesian updating requires a utility function in its likelihood term, we conducted the largest utility-function comparison to date--476 candidate forms differing in psychologically meaningful properties (e.g., payoff exponents, reference dependence, payoff ratios, and envy-guilt asymmetries). Exploring this joint space of payoffs and models allowed us to identify the function that unifies prior theories and generalizes across payoff conditions. Parameter estimation revealed moderate altruism, strong inequality aversion, and nonlinear payoff valuation (exponent &gt; 1). Altruism and social-comparison motives were largely independent, revealing diverse moral phenotypes from cooperative to competitive or sadistic. Together, these findings provide a computational framework and a map of social motives, clarifying how humans learn whom to trust and offering quantitative foundations for promoting cooperation in social and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing credibility and transparency in brain-to-image reconstruction research: Reanalysis of Koide-Majima, Nishimoto, and Majima (Neural Networks, 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent high-profile study by Koide-Majima et al. (2024) claimed a major advance in reconstructing visual imagery from brain activity using a novel variant of a generative AI-based method. However, our independent reanalysis reveals multiple methodological concerns that raise questions about the validity of their conclusions. Specifically, our evaluation demonstrates that: (1) the reconstruction results are biased by selective reporting of only the best-performing examples at multiple levels; (2) performance is artificially inflated by circular metrics that fail to reflect perceptual accuracy; (3) fair baseline comparisons reveal no discernible advantages of the study's key innovations over existing techniques; (4) the central "Bayesian" sampling component is functionally inert, producing outcomes identical to the standard optimization result; and (5) even if the component were successfully implemented, the claims of Bayesian novelty are unsubstantiated, as the proposed method does not leverage the principles of a proper Bayesian framework. These systemic issues necessitate a critical reassessment of the study's contributions. This commentary dissects these deficiencies to underscore the need for greater credibility and transparency in the rapidly advancing field of brain decoding.</description>

      <title>Direction and speed selectivity properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives an in-depth theoretical analysis of the direction and speed selectivity properties of idealized models of the spatio-temporal receptive fields of simple cells and complex cells, based on the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.
  By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii)~different visual neurons having broader {\em vs.\/}\ sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.</description>

      <title>Distance by de-correlation: Computing distance with heterogeneous grid cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding the distance between locations in space is essential for accurate navigation. Grid cells, a functional class of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, are believed to support this computation. However, existing theories of how populations of grid cells code distance rely on complex coding schemes, with assumptions that may not be met by anatomical constraints. Inspired by recent work finding grid cells to have small, but robust heterogeneity in their grid properties, we hypothesize that distance coding can be achieved by a simple de-correlation of population activity. We develop a mathematical theory for describing this de-correlation in one-dimension, showing that its predictions are consistent with simulations of noisy grid cells. Our simulations highlight a non-intuitive prediction of such a distance by de-correlation framework. Namely, that some further distances are better encoded than some nearer distances. We find evidence of this "sweet spot" in previously published rodent behavioral experiments and demonstrate that a decoder which estimates distance from the de-correlation of populations of simulated noisy grid cells leads to a similar pattern of errors. Finally, by simulating noisy grid cells in two-dimensions, we find that there exists a trade-off between the range of distances that can be encoded by de-correlation of population activity and the distinguishability of different distances, which is controlled by the amount of variability in grid properties. We show that the previously observed average amount of grid property variability strikes a balance between the two, enabling the encoding of distances up to several meters. Our work provides new insight on how grid cells can underlie the coding of distance, without the assumptions previously needed, and why grid cells may have small amounts of heterogeneity in their grid properties.</description>

      <title>Cognition as least action: the Physarum Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slime mould Physarum polycephalum displays adaptive transport dynamics and network formation that have inspired its use as a model of biological computation. We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.</description>

      <title>Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive novel, precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>
