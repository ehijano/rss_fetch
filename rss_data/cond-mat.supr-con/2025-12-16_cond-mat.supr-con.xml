      <title>Magnetic field-bias current interplay in HgTe-based three-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate HgTe/Nb-based three-terminal Josephson junctions in T-shaped and X-shaped geometries and their critical current contours (CCCs). By decomposing the CCCs into the contributions from individual junctions, we uncover how bias current and magnetic field jointly determine the collective Josephson behavior. A perpendicular magnetic field induces a tunable crossover between SQUID-like and Fraunhofer-like interference patterns, controlled by the applied bias. Moreover, magnetic flux produces pronounced deformations of the CCC, enabling symmetry control in the $(I_1,I_2)$ plane. Remarkably, we identify a regime of strongly enhanced Josephson diode efficiency, reaching values up to $\eta\approx 0.8$ at low bias and magnetic field. The experimental results are quantitatively reproduced by resistively shunted junction (RSJ) simulations, which capture the coupled dynamics of current and flux in these multi-terminal superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>From chessboard of bipolarons of size 4a in cubic La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 to stripes of the same bipolarons in layered high Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compound La1-xSrxMnO3 exhibits a charge order (CO) state at $x\approx 1/8$ and $T&lt;T_{co}$, which recalls the CO state with a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition, $T_c$, observed in all cuprates at this doping value. Local excitations of lattice and magnetic origins measured in the two-dimensional metallic state of La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 reveal the existence of bipolarons of size $4a$ resulting from structural and antiferromagnetic pairings of hole-rich orbital polarons of size $2a$. They are intertwined with hole-poor domains in a disordered state at $T&gt;T_{co}$ which become ordered on a chessboard organized in a 3D-order state of ferromagnetically paired polarons at $T&lt;T_{co}$. Applied to the CuO$_2$ planes of the cuprates of the "214" family, this model produces stripes of bipolarons intertwined with stripes of antiferromagnetically arranged spins, hole-poor, both of size $4a$, leading to a spin density wave with a wave vector $\delta=1/8$, a charge density wave with $q=1/4$, the Yamada laws $\delta(x)=x$ and $T_c\propto \delta$ and a decrease of $T_c$ at x=1/8. This work invokes relevance of a bipolaronic origin of high $T_c$ superconductivity, in which bipolarons of size $4a$ can play a major role.</description>

      <title>Discriminating Gap Symmetries of Superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductor in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate materials represented by La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened new directions in the quest for unconventional superconductivity. A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniform patterns nucleated at low temperatures: Insight from vortex matter imaged in unprecedentedly large fields-of-view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform patterns present enhanced physical properties that make them the new generation of cutting-edge technological devices. Synthesizing devices with tens of thousands of components arranged in a hyperuniform fashion has thus become a breakthrough to achieve in order to implement these technologies. Here we provide evidence that extended two-dimensional hyperuniform patterns spanning tens of thousands of components can be nucleated using as a template the low-temperature vortex structure obtained in pristine Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 samples after following a field-cooling protocol.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13065v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</description>

      <title>Control of thin NbN film superconducting properties by ScN buffer layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.</description>

      <title>Probing Pair Density Waves with Twisted Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that twisted interfaces between superconductors can serve as a phase-sensitive platform for the detection and characterization of pair density waves (PDW). In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, the critical Josephson current of a twisted PDW interface is maximal at a finite field value, determined by the twist angle and the PDW period -- an explicit signature of the PDW. The results are robust to variations in junction geometry and can be adapted to certain cases with strong disorder or fluctuations. Their temperature dependence allows to distinguish pure PDW from byproducts of coexistence of superconductivity and charge- or spin- density waves.</description>

      <title>Vortex core spectroscopy links pseudogap and Lifshitz critical point in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how superconductivity competes with other electronic phases in cuprates requires direct access to the hidden non-superconducting low temperature phase, for which Abrikosov vortices provide a unique local probe. We map the doping- and field-dependent evolution of vortex-core states in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ across a broad doping range spanning the Fermi-surface Lifshitz transition. High-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a striking transformation of the vortex-core spectrum from unconventional, pseudogap-like signatures at moderate doping to more BCS-like behavior beyond a critical doping $p^* \approx 0.21$. This crossover aligns with the pseudogap endpoint and the onset of Fermi-surface reconstruction, indicating a direct link between pseudogap physics and vortex electronic structure. Our findings highlight the vortex core as a sensitive local probe of the cuprate ground state.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Transport in chiral Mo3Al2C Near the Superconducting to Normal Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Kondo Effect in Superconducting Leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional multichannel Kondo effect takes place when several gapless metallic electronic channels interact with a localized spin-$S$ impurity, with the number of channels $n$ exceeding the size of the impurity spin, $n&gt;2S$, leading to the emergence of non-Fermi liquid impurity behavior at low temperatures. Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln[2\cos(\pi/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices. The concept of vdW nanoreactors offers a powerful and versatile pathway to expand the accessible landscape of quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonrelativistic proof of the spin-statistics theorem is given in terms of the field operators satisfying commutation and anticommutation relations, which are introduced here in the coordinate space as a means to build the permutation symmetry into the brackets of identical particles. An eigenvalue problem of a $\pi$-rotation for a product of two annihilation operators is combined with an analysis on its rotational property to prove the connection that the field operators for integral-spin and half-integral-spin particles obey the commutation and anticommutation relations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Probing ground-state degeneracies of a strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model with superconducting correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</description>

      <title>Time-Crystalline Phase in a Single-Band Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a time-crystalline phase in a single-band holographic superconductor, extending the AdS/CFT framework. By incorporating a nonlinear gauge-scalar coupling and external driving, we derive coupled equations of motion for the plasma and Higgs modes, analogous to those in high-Tc superconductors. Multi-scale analysis reveals a sum resonance with subharmonic growth indicating broken time-translation symmetry. We perform numerical computation of quasinormal mode and demonstrate the transition to the time-crystalline phase. The holographic model may serve as a robust tool for studying strongly coupled time crystals.</description>

      <title>Unconventional $s$-Wave Pairing with Point-Node-Like Gap Structure in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10886v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interference and spectral function of the UTe$_2$ superconductive surface band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled BaBi$_3$ formed by in situ reduction of bismuthate films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Al or Eu and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, leading to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu and Al adlayers leads to the formation of superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$ in nominal Eu/BaBiO$_3$ and Al/BaBiO$_3$ bilayers. Anisotropic magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage signatures of quasi two-dimensional superconductivity are observed. The mechanisms behind quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity and the role of disorder remain to be clarified. These findings highlight the potential for the use of in situ reduction of bismuthate heterostructures as a platform for stabilizing materials with exotic functional properties. Additionally, the strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.</description>

      <title>Active electron cooling of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the emergent field of quantum technology, the ability to manage heat at the nanoscale and in cryogenic conditions is crucial for enhancing device performance in terms of noise, coherence, and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate the active cooling and refrigeration of the electron gas in a graphene thermal transistor, by taking advantage of nanoscale superconductive tunnel contacts able to pump or extract heat directly from the electrons in the device. Our prototypes achieved a top cooling of electrons in graphene of about 15 mK at a bath temperature of about 450 mK, demonstrating the viability of the proposed device architecture. Our experimental findings are backed by a detailed thermal model that accurately replicated the observed device behavior. Alternative cooling schemes and perspectives are discussed in light of the reported results. Finally, our graphene thermal transistor could find application in superconducting hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quenched disorder and the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of weak quenched disorder on the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model within a functional-integral approach. By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</description>
