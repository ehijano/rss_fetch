      <title>Emergent microtubule properties in a model of filament turnover and nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic protein filaments essential for intracellular organization and transport, particularly in long-lived cells such as neurons. The plus and minus ends of neuronal MTs switch between growth and shrinking phases, and the nucleation of new filaments is believed to be regulated in both healthy and injury conditions. We propose stochastic and deterministic mathematical models to investigate the impact of filament nucleation and length-regulation mechanisms on emergent properties such as MT lengths and numbers in living cells. We expand our stochastic continuous-time Markov chain model of filament dynamics to incorporate MT nucleation and capture realistic stochastic fluctuations in MT numbers and tubulin availability. We also propose a simplified partial differential equation (PDE) model, which allows for tractable analytical investigation into steady-state MT distributions under different nucleation and length-regulating mechanisms. We find that the stochastic and PDE modeling approaches show good agreement in predicted MT length distributions, and that both MT nucleation and the catastrophe of large-length MTs regulate MT length distributions. In both frameworks, multiple mechanistic combinations achieve the same average MT length. The models proposed can predict parameter regimes where the system is scarce in tubulin, the building block of MTs, and suggest that low filament nucleation regimes are characterized by high variation in MT lengths, while high nucleation regimes drive high variation in MT numbers. These mathematical frameworks have the potential to improve our understanding of MT regulation in both healthy and injured neurons.</description>

      <title>Morphologic Evolution in Simulated Wood Densification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the radial densification of spruce wood using explicit Finite Element Method simulations, focusing on the effects of various densification protocols. These protocols include quasi-static compression, oscillatory excitation, and self-densification through shrinking hydrogel fillings and their impact on the morphogenesis of folding patterns across different tissue types. The simulations incorporate the an isotropic mechanical behavior of wood tracheid walls and account for moisture and delignification effects using a hierarchical approach. Our results reveal the technological potential of targeted densification in creating tailored density profiles that enhance stiffness and strength. These insights offer valuable guidance for optimizing densification processes in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Rhythm Generation, Robustness, and Control in Stick Insect Locomotion: Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stick insect stepping patterns have been studied for insights about locomotor rhythm generation and control, because the underlying neural system is relatively accessible experimentally and produces a variety of rhythmic outputs. Harnessing the experimental identification of effective interactions among neuronal units involved in stick insect stepping pattern generation, previous studies proposed computational models simulating aspects of stick insect locomotor activity. While these models generate diverse stepping patterns and transitions between them, there has not been an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying their dynamics. In this study, we focus on modeling rhythm generation by the neurons associated with the protraction-retraction, levitation-depression, and extension-flexion antagonistic muscle pairs of the mesothoracic (middle) leg of stick insects. Our model features a reduced central pattern generator (CPG) circuit for each joint and includes synaptic interactions among the CPGs; we also consider extensions such as the inclusion of motoneuron pools controlled by the CPG components. The resulting network is described by an 18-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We use fast-slow decomposition, projection into interacting phase planes, and a heavy reliance on input-dependent nullclines to analyze this model. Specifically, we identify and elucidate dynamic mechanisms capable of generating a stepping rhythm, with a sequence of biologically constrained phase relationships, in a three-joint stick insect limb model. Furthermore, we explain the robustness to parameter changes and tunability of these patterns. In particular, the model allows us to identify possible mechanisms by which neuromodulatory and top-down effects could tune stepping pattern output frequency.</description>

      <title>Monitoring biodiversity on highly reactive rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how biodiversity is affected in a cyclic spatial May-Leonard model with hierarchical and non-hierarchical rules. Here we propose a generalization of the traditional rock-paper-scissors model by considering highly reactive species, i. e., species that react in a stronger manner compared to the others in respect to either competition or reproduction. These two classes of models, called here Highly Competitive and Highly Reproductive models, may lead to hierarchical and non-hierarchical dynamics, depending on the number of highly reactive species. The fundamental feature of these models is the fact that hierarchical models may as well support biodiversity, however, with a higher probability of extinction than the non-hierarchical ones, which are in fact more robust. This analysis is done by evaluating the probability of extinction as a function of mobility. In particular, we have analyzed how the dominance scheme changes depending on the highly reactive species for non-hierarchical models, where the findings lead to the conclusion that highly reactive species are usually at a disadvantage compared to the others. Moreover, we have investigated the power spectrum and the characteristic length of each species, including more information on the behavior of the several systems considered in the present work.</description>

      <title>Local Clustering and Global Spreading of Receptors for Optimal Spatial Gradient Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial information from cell-surface receptors is crucial for processes that require signal processing and sensing of the environment. Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a fluid flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces, which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stress in a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two-dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Redefining Fitness: Evolution as a Dynamic Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to their living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness, defined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that this definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue, several authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms of the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show that fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping population dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this problem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed in this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also show how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems of evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in group-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit bridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning theory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>SynLlama: Generating Synthesizable Molecules and Their Analogs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models for small molecule drug discovery have shown immense promise, but many molecules they generate are too difficult to synthesize, making them impractical for further investigation or development. In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers strong performance in bottom-up synthesis, synthesizable analog generation, and hit expansion, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for drug discovery developments. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic Markers: CFD-Based Prediction of Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of aneurysm evolution on hemodynamic characteristics within the sac region. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), blood flow through the parent vessel and aneurysm sac was analyzed to assess the impact on wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), and the oscillatory shear index (OSI), key indicators of rupture risk. Additionally, Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP) were examined to provide a broader understanding of the aneurysm's hemodynamic environment. Six distinct cerebral aneurysm (CA) models, all from individuals of the same gender, were selected to minimize gender-related variability.
  Results showed that unruptured cases exhibited higher WSS and TAWSS, along with lower OSI and RRT values patterns consistent with stable flow conditions supporting vascular integrity. In contrast, ruptured cases had lower WSS and TAWSS, coupled with elevated OSI and RRT, suggesting disturbed and oscillatory flow commonly linked to aneurysm wall weakening. ECAP was also higher in ruptured cases, indicating increased endothelial activation under unstable flow. Notably, areas with the highest OSI and RRT often aligned with vortex centers, reinforcing the association between disturbed flow and aneurysm instability.
  These findings highlight the value of combining multiple hemodynamic parameters for rupture risk assessment. Including RRT and ECAP provides deeper insight into flow endothelium-interactions, offering a stronger basis for evaluating aneurysm stability and guiding treatment decisions.</description>
