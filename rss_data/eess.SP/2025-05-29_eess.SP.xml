      <title>Temporal Convolutional Autoencoder for Interference Mitigation in FMCW Radar Altimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the end-to-end altitude estimation performance of a convolutional autoencoder-based interference mitigation approach for frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar altimeters. Specifically, we show that a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) autoencoder effectively exploits temporal correlations in the received signal, providing superior interference suppression compared to a Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filter. Unlike existing approaches, the present method operates directly on the received FMCW signal. Additionally, we identify key challenges in applying deep learning to wideband FMCW interference mitigation and outline directions for future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to arbitrary interference conditions.</description>

      <title>Flexure-FET-Based Receiver with Competitive Binding for Interference Mitigation in Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC), a biologically inspired technology, enables applications in nanonetworks and the Internet of Everything (IoE), with great potential for intra-body systems such as drug delivery, health monitoring, and disease detection. This paper extends our prior work on the Flexure-FET MC receiver by integrating a competitive binding model to enhance performance in high-interference environments, where multiple molecular species coexist in the reception space. Previous studies have largely focused on ligand concentration estimation and detection, without fully addressing the effects of inter-species competition for receptor binding. Our proposed framework captures this competition, offering a more biologically accurate model for multitarget environments. By incorporating competition dynamics, the model improves understanding of MC behavior under interference. This approach enables fine-tuning of receptor responses by adjusting ligand concentrations and receptor affinities, thereby optimizing the performance of the Flexure-FET MC receiver. Comprehensive analysis shows that accounting for competitive binding is crucial for improving reliability and accuracy in complex MC systems. Factors such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), symbol error probability (SEP), interferer concentration, and receptor dynamics are shown to significantly affect performance. The proposed framework highlights the need to manage these factors effectively. Results demonstrate that modeling interference through competitive binding offers a realistic system perspective and allows tuning of receiver response, enabling robust detection in environments with multiple coexisting species.</description>

      <title>Bi-Residual Neural Network based Synchronous Motor Electrical Faults Diagnosis: Intra-link Layer Design for High-frequency Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical resource-constrained environments, efficiently extracting the potential high-frequency fault-critical information is an inherent problem. To overcome this problem, this work suggests leveraging a bi-residual neural network named Bi-ResNet to extract the inner spatial-temporal high-frequency features using embedded spatial-temporal convolution blocks and intra-link layers. It can be considered as embedding a high-frequency extractor into networks without adding any parameters, helping shallow networks achieve the performance of deep networks. In our experiments, five advanced CNN-based neural networks and two baselines across a real-life dataset are utilized for synchronous motor electrical fault diagnosis to demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-ResNet including one analytical, comparative, and ablation experiments. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The Bi-ResNet can perform better on low-resolution noisy data. 2) The proposed intra-links can help high-frequency components extraction and location from raw data. 3) There is a trade-off between intra-link number and input data complexity.</description>

      <title>Joint Phase Shift Optimization and Precoder Selection for RIS-Assisted 5G NR MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By intelligently reconfiguring wireless propagation environment, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can enhance signal quality, suppress interference, and improve channel conditions, thereby serving as a powerful complement to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures. However, jointly optimizing the RIS phase shifts and the MIMO transmit precoder in 5G and beyond networks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a singular value ($\lambda$)-based RIS optimization strategy, where the phase shifts are configured to maximize the dominant singular values of the cascaded channel matrix, and the corresponding singular vectors are utilized for MIMO transmit precoding. The proposed precoder selection does not require mutual information computation across subbands, thereby reducing time complexity. To solve the $\lambda$-based optimization problem, maximum cross-swapping algorithm (MCA) is applied while an effective rank-based method is utilized for benchmarking purposes. The simulation results show that the proposed precoder selection method consistently outperforms the conventional approach under $\lambda$-based RIS optimization.</description>

      <title>Topological Adaptive Least Mean Squares Algorithms over Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow signals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS) methods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory, we present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming signals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed stochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions, steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the impact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design optimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired estimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g., the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world traffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed settings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order topological features.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback for Wi-Fi Systems With Temporal Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve higher throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi systems, a station (STA) needs to efficiently compress channel state information (CSI) and feed it back to an access point (AP). In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback framework tailored for next-generation Wi-Fi systems. Our framework incorporates a pair of encoder and decoder neural networks to compress and reconstruct the angle parameters of the CSI. To enable an efficient finite-bit representation of the encoder output, we introduce a trainable vector quantization module, which is integrated after the encoder network and jointly trained with both the encoder and decoder networks in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we further enhance our framework by leveraging the temporal correlation of the angle parameters. Specifically, we propose an angle-difference feedback strategy which transmits the difference between the current and previous angle parameters when the difference is sufficiently small. This strategy accounts for the periodicity of the angle parameters through proper preprocessing and mitigates error propagation effects using novel feedback methods. We also introduce a DL-based CSI refinement module for the AP, which improves the reconstruction accuracy of the angle parameters by simultaneously utilizing both the previous and current feedback information. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the standard method employed in current Wi-Fi systems. Our results also demonstrate significant performance gains achieved by the angle-difference feedback strategy and the CSI refinement module.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the LCB-CV-UNet to tackle performance degradation caused by High Dynamic Range (HDR) radar signals. Initially, a hardware-efficient, plug-and-play module named Logarithmic Connect Block (LCB) is proposed as a phase coherence preserving solution to address the inherent challenges in handling HDR features. Then, we propose the Dual Hybrid Dataset Construction method to generate a semi-synthetic dataset, approximating typical HDR signal scenarios with adjustable target distributions. Simulation results show about 1% total detection probability improvement with under 0.9% computational complexity added compared with the baseline. Furthermore, it excels 5% over the baseline at the range in 11-13 dB signal-to-noise ratio typical for urban targets. Finally, the real experiment validates the practicality of our model.</description>

      <title>Dual-Task Graph Neural Network for Joint Seizure Onset Zone Localization and Outcome Prediction using Stereo EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately localizing the brain regions that triggers seizures and predicting whether a patient will be seizure-free after surgery are vital for surgical planning and patient management in drug-resistant epilepsy. Stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) delivers high-fidelity intracranial recordings that enable clinicians to precisely locate epileptogenic networks. However, the clinical identification is subjective and dependent on the expertise of the clinical team. Data driven approaches in this domain are sparse, despite the fact that sEEG offers high temporal-fidelity related to seizure dynamics that can be leveraged using graph structures ideal for imitating brain networks. In this study, we introduce a dual-task graph-neural network (GNN) framework that operates on windowed sEEG recordings to jointly predict seizure-freedom outcomes and identify seizure-onset-zone (SOZ) channels. We assemble non-overlapping 10 second windows from 51 clinical seizures spread across 20 pediatric patients, with sEEG data annotated by clinical experts. For each temporal window we construct a functional connectivity graph via thresholded Pearson correlations and extract rich node features (spectral, statistical, wavelet, Hjorth and local graph features), alongside six global graph descriptors. We optimize a combined cross-entropy loss with a tunable task-weight, and select model hyper-parameters via Optuna. Under window-level 10-fold cross-validation, the model achieves a mean graph-level accuracy of $89.31 \pm 0.0976 \%$ for seizure-freedom prediction and a node-level SOZ localization accuracy of $94.72. \pm 0.0041 \%$. For the best performing model, we ran additive and leave-one-out ablation studies to explore feature importance for graph and node-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Estimation Loss Control in Variational Quantum Sensing via Online Conformal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>DeepFilterGAN: A Full-band Real-time Speech Enhancement System with GAN-based Stochastic Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further improvements.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient-Tracking with Finite-Time Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for decentralized optimization and learning rely on local optimization steps coupled with combination steps over a graph. Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieve finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm, clarifying the interplay between accuracy and length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise.</description>

      <title>Distributed Federated Learning for Vehicular Network Security: Anomaly Detection Benefits and Multi-Domain Attack Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale, high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data. Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network. We further show that local training data size and time-varying network connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for computing the N-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based solely on recursive Rectangular Index Compression (RIC) [1][2] and structured frequency shifts. The RIC DFT algorithm compresses a signal from $N=CL$ to $C\in[2,N/2]$ points at the expense of $N-1$ complex additions and no complex multiplication. It is shown that a $C$-point DFT on the compressed signal corresponds exactly to $C$ DFT coefficients of the original $N$-point DFT, namely, $X_{kL}$, $k=0,1,\ldots,C-1$ with no need for twiddle factors. We rely on this strategy to decompose the DFT by recursively compressing the input signal and applying global frequency shifts (to get odd-indexed DFT coefficients). We show that this new structure can relax the power-of-two assumption of the radix-2 FFT by enabling signal input lengths such as $N=c\cdot 2^k$ (for $k\geq 0$ and a non-power-of-two $c&gt;0$). Thus, our algorithm potentially outperforms radix-2 FFTs for the cases where significant zero-padding is needed. The proposed approach achieves a computational complexity of $O(N \log N)$ and offers a new structural perspective on DFT computation, with potential impacts on several DFT issues like numerical stability, hardware implementation, sparse transforms, convolutions, and others DFT-based procedures.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement by harnessing the electron transition phenomenon of Rydberg atoms. Operating at the quantum scale, such receivers have the potential to breakthrough the performance limit of classic receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-empowered communications. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classic receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the recent progresses in RARE-aided wireless communications, covering the frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Moreover, the unique application of RARE in multiband sensing and communication is introduced. Finally, we conclude by providing promising research directions.</description>

Abstract: Most existing semantic communication (SemCom) systems use deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) to encode task-specific semantics in a goal-oriented manner. However, their reliance on predefined tasks and datasets significantly limits their flexibility and generalizability in practical deployments. Multi-modal foundation models provide a promising solution by generating universal semantic tokens. Inspired by this, we introduce SemCLIP, a zero-shot SemCom framework leveraging the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model. By transmitting CLIP-generated image tokens instead of raw images, SemCLIP enables efficient SemCom under low bandwidth and challenging channel conditions, facilitating diverse downstream tasks and zero-shot applications. Specifically, we propose a DeepJSCC scheme for efficient CLIP token encoding. To mitigate potential degradation caused by compression and channel noise, a multi-modal transmission-aware prompt learning mechanism is designed at the receiver, which adapts prompts based on transmission quality, enhancing system robustness and channel adaptability. Simulation results demonstrate that SemCLIP outperforms the baselines, achieving a $41\%$ improvement in zero-shot performance at low signal-to-noise ratios. Meanwhile, SemCLIP reduces bandwidth usage by more than $50$-fold compared to alternative image transmission methods, demonstrating the potential of foundation models towards a generalized, task-agnostic SemCom solution.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Ramanujan Functions: Constructions, Properties, and Applications in Communications and Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, I construct a new set of functions based on Ramanujan sequences (RSEs), Gaussian pulse (GP), and its delayed Gaussian pulse (DGP). The motivation for this construction is based on the special properties of RSEs, GP, and DGP. First, I present a procedure for constructing Gauss-Ramanujan (GauRam) functions using selected RSEs. I develop an insightful analysis for deterministic and stochastic overlap between GP and DGP. Specifically, I present exact and closed form approximation expressions for delay-averaged GP and DGP overlap and then evaluate them numerically. Later, I derive and analyze the mathematical (spectral) properties of selected GauRam functions. I extend the analysis by analyzing the Hilbert transform of the first-order GauRam function and validating orthogonality and its usefulness in analytic signal representations.
  Furthermore, I present insightful applications of these functions in communications and signal processing. Specifically, I present the continuous-wave Gauss-Ramanujan modulation (GRM) scheme, Gauss-Ramanujan Shift Keying (GRSK) scheme, and Gauss-Ramanujan wavelets and their analysis and comparisons with benchmarking. The desirable properties of these novel modulation schemes and wavelets enable their use in next-generation hybrid and energy-efficient communication systems and signal processing.</description>

      <title>SGD Jittering: A Training Strategy for Robust and Accurate Model-Based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems aim to reconstruct unseen data from corrupted or perturbed measurements. While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Robustness-enhanced Myoelectric Control with GAN-based Open-set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used in human motion recognition and medical rehabilitation, yet their variability and susceptibility to noise significantly limit the reliability of myoelectric control systems. Existing recognition algorithms often fail to handle unfamiliar actions effectively, leading to system instability and errors. This paper proposes a novel framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems by enabling open-set recognition. The method incorporates a GAN-based discriminator to identify and reject unknown actions, maintaining system stability by preventing misclassifications. Experimental evaluations on publicly available and self-collected datasets demonstrate a recognition accuracy of 97.6\% for known actions and a 23.6\% improvement in Active Error Rate (AER) after rejecting unknown actions. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and suitable for deployment on edge devices, making it practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>An unsupervised method for MRI recovery: Deep image prior with structured sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: To propose and validate an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method that does not require fully sampled k-space data. Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.</description>
