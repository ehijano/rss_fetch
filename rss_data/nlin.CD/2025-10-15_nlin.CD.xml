      <title>Topological Vibration Analysis of Elastic Lattices via Bloch Sphere Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical lattices support topological wave phenomena governed by geometric phases. We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional elastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of orthogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a Bloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry protection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes is piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps at symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that restoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the geometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing norm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere rotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A pi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a longitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates. These gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across wavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal stiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and sideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric phases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated regimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains robust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase data. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern dispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze and design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures.</description>

      <title>Uncontrolled geostationary satellites: mapping periodic transitions to chaos with Lagrangian Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncontrolled geostationary satellites abandoned near an unstable equilibrium point of the equator experience irregular transitions between dynamical states (continuous circulation, long and short libration). They are caused by the interaction between the longitudinal dynamics, governed by the tesseral harmonics of the geopotential, and the orbital precession forced by Earth's oblateness and lunisolar perturbations. The transitions are extremely sensitive to small perturbations, making the long-term evolution unpredictable. Recently, a Monte Carlo analysis of trajectories starting in the immediate vicinity of the 165 degrees E unstable equilibrium point, revealed that the evolution to chaos is not gradual. It occurs via sudden episodes of disorder at specific points of the precession cycle, when the orbital inclination is minimal. Due to the high cost of the statistical analysis, the results were limited to a single initial longitude. This paper applies modified versions of the diameter Lagrangian descriptor to reduce the computational burden. This enables mapping the dynamical behavior over the complete range of longitudes where transitions between modes of motion are possible, considering both unstable equilibrium points (165 degrees E and 15 degrees W). It is found that the episodes of chaos remain linked to the orbital inclination cycle, but their timing depends on the initial spacecraft longitude. As the initial position moves farther away from the unstable point, the transitions take place at higher values of the orbital inclination. The longitudes where the transitions occur at maximum inclination correspond to the boundaries of the chaotic region.</description>

      <title>Chaotic variability in a model of coupled ice streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regions of fast-flowing ice in ice sheets, known as ice streams, have been theorized to be able to exhibit build-up/surge oscillatory variability due to thermomechanical coupling at the base of the ice. A simple model of three coupled ice streams is constructed to replicate the spatial configuration of a single ice stream being bisected into two termini. The model is constructed to mimic existing branching ice streams in northern Greenland. This model is shown to exhibit both steady-flow and build-up/surge oscillations. Further, the variability can be chaotic due to the nonlinear coupling of three incommensurate frequencies. This provides a mode of chaotic internal variability for ice sheets that contain these types of ice streams.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal stability of synchronized coupled map lattice states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of spatiotemporal chaos, unstable periodic orbits play a major role in understanding the dynamics. Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analytical solutions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a quantum billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive semiclassical analytical solutions for both the diagonal and off-diagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in a quarter-stadium quantum billiard. For a representative observable, we obtain an explicit expression and an asymptotic closed-form solution that naturally separate into a local contribution and a phase-space correlation term. These analytical results predict the band structure of the observable matrix, including its bandwidth and scaling behavior. We further demonstrate that our analytical formula is equivalent to the prediction of Berry's conjecture. Supported by numerical evidence, we show that Berry's conjecture captures the energetic long-wavelength behavior in the space of eigenstates, while our analytical solution describes the asymptotic behavior of the f function in the semiclassical limit. Finally, by revealing the connection between the bandwidth scaling and the underlying classical dynamics, our results suggest that the ETH carries important physical implications in single-particle and few-body systems, where "thermalization" manifests as the loss of information about initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The simplest 2D quantum walk detects chaoticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks are at present an active field of study in mathematics, with important applications in quantum information and statistical physics. In this paper, we determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. For this purpose, we consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternating one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates in bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior induced by the boundary shape in the deterministic classical motion translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem, resulting in sharp differences in the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. Indeed, we found for the Bunimovich stadium -- a chaotic billiard -- level statistics described by a Brody distribution with parameter $\delta \simeq 0.1$. This indicates a weak level repulsion, and also enhanced eigenfunction localization, with an average participation ratio (PR) $\simeq$ 1150) compared to the rectangular billiard (regular) case, where the average PR $\simeq$ 1500. Furthermore, scarring on unstable periodic orbits is observed. The fact that our simple model exhibits such key signatures of quantum chaos, e.g., non-Poissonian level statistics and scarring, that are sensitive to the underlying classical dynamics in the free particle billiard system is utterly surprising, especially when taking into account that quantum walks are diffusive models, which are not direct quantizations of a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Panda: A pretrained forecast model for chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear Dynamics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen chaotic systems preserving both short-term accuracy and long-term statistics. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We also demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.</description>
