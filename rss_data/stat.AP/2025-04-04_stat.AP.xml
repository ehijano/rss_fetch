      <title>Stable EEG Source Estimation for Standardized Kalman Filter using Change Rate Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the measurement and evolution modeling of Standardized Kalman filtering in brain activity estimation when non-invasive electroencephalography measurements are used as the data. Here, we propose new parameter tuning and model utilizing the change rate of brain activity distribution to improve the stability of the otherwise accurate estimation. Namely, we pose a backward differentiation-based measurement model for the change rate that increased the stability of the tracking notably. Simulated data and data from a real subject were used in experiments.</description>

      <title>Youthful perspectives on sustainability: Examining pro-environmental behaviors in tourism through latent class cluster analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tourism has emerged as a significant driver of the global economy. As its economic impact grows, concerns regarding environmental sustainability have intensified. This paper explores the dual dimensions of sustainable tourism: the relationship between tourism supply and sustainability, and tourist demand characteristics. It highlights the critical role of young tourists, who exhibit a heightened awareness of environmental issues and advocate for sustainable practices. By conducting a survey among young Italian university students, the study identifies distinct segments based on family background, political orientation, and travel habits. Utilizing latent class cluster analysis, the findings aim to enhance understanding of pro-environmental behaviors among youth, offering insights for policymakers to foster sustainable tourism practices.</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Spatial Dependencies Across Multiple Subjects in Multiplexed Tissue Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a spatially heterogeneous ecosystem where cellular interactions shape tumor progression and response to therapy. Multiplexed imaging technologies enable high-resolution spatial characterization of the TME, yet statistical methods for analyzing multi-subject spatial tissue data remain limited. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for inferring spatial dependencies in multiplexed imaging datasets across multiple subjects. Our model represents the TME as a multivariate log-Gaussian Cox process, where spatial intensity functions of different cell types are governed by a latent multivariate Gaussian process. By pooling information across subjects, we estimate spatial correlation functions that capture within-type and cross-type dependencies, enabling interpretable inference about disease-specific cellular organization. We validate our method using simulations, demonstrating robustness to latent factor specification and spatial resolution. We apply our approach to two multiplexed imaging datasets: pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, revealing distinct spatial organization patterns across disease subtypes and highlighting tumor-immune interactions that differentiate immune-permissive and immune-exclusive microenvironments. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of immune evasion and may inform novel therapeutic strategies. Our approach offers a principled framework for modeling spatial dependencies in multi-subject data, with broader applicability to spatially resolved omics and imaging studies. An R package, available online, implements our methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Discretization: A Continuous-Time Framework for Event Generation in Neuromorphic Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel continuous-time framework is proposed for modeling neuromorphic image sensors in the form of an initial canonical representation with analytical tractability. Exact simulation algorithms are developed in parallel with closed-form expressions that characterize the model's dynamics. This framework enables the generation of synthetic event streams in genuine continuous-time, which combined with the analytical results, reveal the underlying mechanisms driving the oscillatory behavior of event data presented in the literature.</description>

      <title>Online Multivariate Regularized Distributional Regression for High-dimensional Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic electricity price forecasting (PEPF) is a key task for market participants in short-term electricity markets. The increasing availability of high-frequency data and the need for real-time decision-making in energy markets require online estimation methods for efficient model updating. We present an online, multivariate, regularized distributional regression model, allowing for the modeling of all distribution parameters conditional on explanatory variables. Our approach is based on the combination of the multivariate distributional regression and an efficient online learning algorithm based on online coordinate descent for LASSO-type regularization. Additionally, we propose to regularize the estimation along a path of increasingly complex dependence structures of the multivariate distribution, allowing for parsimonious estimation and early stopping. We validate our approach through one of the first forecasting studies focusing on multivariate probabilistic forecasting in the German day-ahead electricity market while using only online estimation methods. We compare our approach to online LASSO-ARX-models with adaptive marginal distribution and to online univariate distributional models combined with an adaptive Copula. We show that the multivariate distributional regression, which allows modeling all distribution parameters - including the mean and the dependence structure - conditional on explanatory variables such as renewable in-feed or past prices provide superior forecasting performance compared to modeling of the marginals only and keeping a static/unconditional dependence structure. Additionally, online estimation yields a speed-up by a factor of 80 to over 400 times compared to batch fitting.</description>

      <title>Predicting passenger injury distributions under uncertainty variables using Gaussian process modeling with GHBMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a Gaussian Process (GP) modeling method to predict statistical characteristics of injury kinematics responses using Human Body Models (HBM) more accurately and efficiently. We validate the GHBMC model against a 50\%tile male Post-Mortem Human Surrogate (PMHS) test. Using this validated model, we create various postured models and generate injury prediction data across different postures and personalized D-ring heights through parametric crash simulations. We then train the GP using this simulation data, implementing a novel adaptive sampling approach to improve accuracy. The trained GP model demonstrates robustness by achieving target prediction accuracy at points with high uncertainty. The proposed method performs continuous injury prediction for various crash scenarios using just 27 computationally expensive simulation runs. This method can be effectively applied to designing highly reliable occupant restraint systems across diverse crash conditions.</description>

      <title>TowerDebias: A Novel Unfairness Removal Method Based on the Tower Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making processes have increasingly come to rely on sophisticated machine learning tools, raising critical concerns about the fairness of their predictions with respect to sensitive groups. The widespread adoption of commercial "black-box" models necessitates careful consideration of their legal and ethical implications for consumers. When users interact with such black-box models, a key challenge arises: how can the influence of sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, be mitigated or removed from its predictions? We propose towerDebias (tDB), a novel post-processing method designed to reduce the influence of sensitive attributes in predictions made by black-box models. Our tDB approach leverages the Tower Property from probability theory to improve prediction fairness without requiring retraining of the original model. This method is highly versatile, as it requires no prior knowledge of the original algorithm's internal structure and is adaptable to a diverse range of applications. We present a formal fairness improvement theorem for tDB and showcase its effectiveness in both regression and classification tasks using multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Combining BART and Principal Stratification to estimate the effect of intermediate variables on primary outcomes with application to estimating the effect of family planning on employment in Nigeria and Senegal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is interest in learning about the causal effects of family planning (FP) on empowerment-related outcomes. Data related to this question are available from studies in which FP programs increase access to FP, but such interventions do not necessarily result in uptake of FP. In addition, women impacted by such programs may differ systematically from target populations of interest in ways that alter the effect of FP. To assess the causal effect of FP on empowerment-related outcomes, we developed a 2-step approach. We use principal stratification and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to non-parametrically estimate the effect in the source population among women affected by a FP program. We generalize the results to a broader population by taking the expectation of conditional average treatment effects from the selective sample over the covariate distribution in the target population. To estimate (uncertainty in) the covariate distribution from survey data with a complex sampling design, we use a Bayesian bootstrap (BB). We apply the approach to estimate the causal effect of modern contraceptive use on employment among urban women in Nigeria and Senegal and find strong effects and effect heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses suggest robustness to violations of assumptions for internal and external validity.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <title>The "Days of Learning" Metric for Education Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third National Charter School Study aimed to test whether charter school were effective and to highlight outcomes on academic progress. The results showed that typical charter school students outperformed similar students in noncharter public schools by 6 days in mathematics and 16 days in reading. The key metric used to claim better performance in charter schools is "days of learning." In this report, the origin of the days-of-learning metric is explored with NAEP data, and the interpretation of days of learning as within-year growth is considered.</description>
