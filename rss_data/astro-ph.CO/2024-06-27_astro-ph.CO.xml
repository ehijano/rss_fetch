      <title>Cosmic Reionization in the JWST Era: Back to AGNs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emergent population of moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 4&lt; z&lt; 14 powered by accretion onto early massive black holes. The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium (IGM) that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that: (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10-15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, &gt;80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of HeII until z~2.8-3.0, in agreement with observations of the HeII Lyman-alpha forest. In our fiducial models: 1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z~5.3-5.5, and reaches its midpoint at z~6.5-6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ~0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic web in Ly$\alpha$ emission over large scales: an Intensity Mapping forecast for DECaLS/BASS and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being the most prominent HI line, Ly$\alpha$ permeates the cosmic web in emission. Despite its potential as a cosmological probe, its detection on large scales remains elusive. We present a new methodology to perform Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping with broad-band optical images, by cross-correlating them with Ly$\alpha$ forest data using a custom one-parameter estimator. We also develop an analytical large-scale Ly$\alpha$ emission model with two parameters (average luminosity $\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$ and bias $b_{\rm e}$) that respects observational constraints from QSO luminosity functions. We compute a forecast for DECaLS/BASS $g$-band images cross-correlated with DESI Ly$\alpha$ forest data, setting guidelines for reducing images into Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps. Given the transversal scales of our cross-correlation (26.4 arcmin, $\sim$33 cMpc/h), our study effectively integrates Ly$\alpha$ emission over all the cosmic volume inside the DESI footprint at $2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.4$ (the $g$-band Ly$\alpha$ redshift range). Over the parameter space ($\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$, $b_{\rm e}$) sampled by our forecast, we find a 3$\sigma$ of large-scale structure in Ly$\alpha$ likely, with a probability of detection of 23.95\% for DESI-DECaLS/BASS, and 54.93\% for a hypothetical DESI phase II with twice as much Ly$\alpha$ QSOs. Without a detection, we derive upper bounds on $\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$ competitive with optimistic literature estimates ($2.3 \pm 1 \cdot 10^{\rm 41}$ erg/s/cMpc$^3$ for DESI, and $\sim$35\% lower for its hypothetical phase II). Extrapolation to the DESI-Rubin overlap shows that a detection of large-scale structure with Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping using next-generation imaging surveys is certain. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.</description>

      <title>The prototypical major cluster merger Abell 754. I. Calibration of MeerKAT data and radio/X-ray spectral mapping of the cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abell 754 is a rich galaxy cluster at $z=0.0543$ and is considered the prototype of a major cluster merger. Like many dynamically unrelaxed systems, it hosts diffuse radio emission on Mpc-scales. Extended synchrotron sources in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are commonly interpreted as evidence that a fraction of the gravitational energy released during cluster mergers is dissipated into non-thermal components. Here, we use new MeerKAT UHF- and L-band observations to study non-thermal phenomena in Abell 754. These data are complemented with archival XMM-Newton observations to investigate the resolved spectral properties of both the radio and X-ray cluster emission. For the first time, we employed the pipeline originally developed to calibrate LOFAR data to MeerKAT observations. This allowed us to perform a direction-dependent calibration and obtain highly sensitive radio images in UHF- and L-bands which capture the extended emission with unprecedented detail. By using a large XMM-Newton mosaic, we produced thermodynamic maps of the ICM. Our analysis reveals that the radio halo in the cluster center is bounded by the well-known shock in the eastern direction. Furthermore, in the south-west periphery, we discover an extended radio source that we classify as a radio relic which is possibly tracing a shock driven by the squeezed gas compressed by the merger, outflowing in perpendicular directions. The low-luminosity of this relic appears compatible with direct acceleration of thermal pool electrons. We interpreted the observed radio and X-ray features in the context of a major cluster merger with a non-zero impact parameter. Abell 754 is a remarkable galaxy cluster showcasing exceptional features associated with the ongoing merger event. The high quality of the new MeerKAT data motivates further work on this system.</description>

      <title>A halo model approach to describe clustering and emission of the two main star forming galaxy populations for Cosmic Infrared Background studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), traced by the emission from dusty star-forming galaxies, provides a crucial window into the phases of star formation throughout cosmic history. These galaxies, although challenging to detect individually at high redshifts due to their faintness, cumulatively contribute to the CIB which then becomes a powerful probe of galaxy formation, evolution and clustering. Here, we introduce a physically-motivated model for the CIB emission spanning a wide range of frequency and angular resolution, employing a halo model approach and distinguishing, within dark matter halos, between two main populations of star forming galaxies, i.e. normal late-type spiral and irregular galaxies and the progenitors of early-type galaxies. The emission from two galaxy populations maps into different regimes in frequency/resolution space, allowing us to constrain the clustering parameters of the model - $M_{\text{min}}$, the mass of a halo with 50% probability of having a central galaxy and $\alpha$, the power law index regulating the number of satellite galaxies - through a fit to Planck and Herschel-SPIRE CIB anisotropy measurements. We find that, while being able to place constraints on some of the clustering parameters, the Planck frequency and multipole coverage cannot effectively disentangle the contributions from the two galaxy populations. On the other side, the Herschel-SPIRE measurements separate out and constrain the clustering of both populations. Our work, though, highlights an inconsistency of the results between the two datasets, partially already reported in other literature and still not understood.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-limit photon mean free path at the end of late reionisation in the Sherwood-Relics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence supporting reionisation ending at redshift z&lt;6 includes the rapid redshift evolution of the mean free path for Lyman-limit photons through the intergalactic medium at 5&lt;z&lt;6. Here we investigate the mean free path predicted by the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Simulations with comoving volumes of 40^3 h^-3 cMpc^3 (160^3 h^-3 cMpc^3), calibrated to match the observed Lyman-alpha forest transmission with a late end to reionisation at z&lt;6, are consistent with recent mean free path measurements at z&lt;5.9, and are 1.2\sigma (1.8\sigma) above the highest redshift mean free path measurement at z=5.93. The majority of the Lyman-limit opacity at the end of reionisation is attributable to highly ionised Lyman-alpha forest absorbers with neutral hydrogen column densities N_HI=10^16--10^17 cm^-2. Resolving these systems is critical for capturing the redshift evolution of the mean free path during the final stages of reionisation. After reionisation completes, overdense gas will reduce the mean free path by up to 20 per cent around haloes with masses M_h ~ 10^9--10^11 h^-1 M_sol, but during reionisation ionised bubbles will instead boost the mean free path around haloes by up to an order of magnitude when the IGM is as much as 90 per cent neutral by volume. This effect will play an important role in the visibility of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z&gt;10 discovered with JWST.</description>

      <title>A rare, strong shock front in the merging cluster SPT-CL J2031-4037</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our findings from the new deep Chandra observations ($256$ ks) of the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2031-4037 at $z = 0.34$. Our observations reveal intricate structures seen in a major merger akin to the Bullet Cluster. The X-ray data confirm the existence of two shock fronts, one to the northwest and one to the southeast by directly measuring the temperature jump of gas across the surface brightness edges. The stronger shock front in the northwest has a density jump of $3.16 \pm 0.34$ across the sharp surface brightness edge and Mach number $M = 3.36^{+0.87}_{-0.48}$, which makes this cluster one of the rare merging systems with a Mach number $M &gt; 2$. We use the northwestern shock to compare two models for shock heating - the instant heating model and the Coulomb collisional heating model, and we determine that the temperatures across the shock front agree with the Coulomb collisional model of heating. For the shock front in the southeastern region, we find a density jump of $1.53 \pm 0.14$ and a Mach number of $M = 1.36 ^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$.</description>

      <title>Interacting ultralight dark matter and dark energy and fits to cosmological data in a field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of dark matter as a pressure-less fluid and of dark energy as a cosmological constant, both minimally coupled to gravity, constitutes the basis of the concordance $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the structure of a cosmic string wake, considering both the effects of regular and quantum pressure terms. We consider the total fluid to consist of a combination of baryons and dark matter. Hence, we are also able to study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the distribution of baryons inside the wake. We focus on parameter values for the superfluid dark matter which allow a MONDian explanation of galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <title>PUREPath: A Deep Latent Variational Model for Estimating CMB Posterior over Large Angular Scales of the Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive neural architecture, the PUREPath, which leverages a nested Probabilistic multi-modal U- Net framework, augmented by the inclusion of probabilistic ResNet blocks in the Expanding Pathway of the decoders, to estimate the posterior density of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal conditioned on the observed CMB data and the training dataset. By seamlessly integrating Bayesian statistics and variational methods our model effectively minimizes foreground contamination in the observed CMB maps. The model is trained using foreground and noise contaminated CMB temperature maps simulated at Planck LFI and HFI frequency channels 30 - 353 GHz using publicly available Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) and Python Sky Model (PySM) packages. During training, our model transforms initial prior distribution on the model parameters to posterior distributions based on the training data. From the joint full posterior of the model parameters, during inference, a predicitve CMB posterior and summary statistics such as the predictive mean, variance etc of the cleaned CMB map is estimated. The predictive standard deviation map provides a direct and interpretable measure of uncertainty per pixel in the predicted mean CMB map. The cleaned CMB map along with the error estimates can be used for more accurate measurements of cosmological parameters and other cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Resonant Conversion of Gravitational Waves in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves are the subject of rapidly growing interest in the theoretical and experimental community. In this work we calculate the resonant conversion of gravitational waves into photons in the magnetospheres of neutron stars via the inverse Gertsenshtein mechanism. The resonance occurs in regions where the vacuum birefringence effects cancel the classical plasma contribution to the photon dispersion relation, leading to a massless photon in the medium which becomes kinematically matched to the graviton. We set limits on the amplitude of a possible stochastic background of gravitational waves using X-ray and IR flux measurements of neutron stars. Using Chandra ($2-8\,\text{keV}$) and NuSTAR ($3-79\,\text{keV}$) observations of RX J1856.6-3754, we set strain limits $h_c^{\rm lim} \simeq 10^{-26} - 10^{-24}$ in the frequency range $ 5\times 10^{17}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 2\times 10^{19}\,\text{Hz}$. Our limits are many orders of magnitude stronger than existing constrains from individual neutron stars at the same frequencies. We also use recent JWST observations of the Magnetar 4U 0142+61 in the range $2.7\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 5.9\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} $, setting a limit $h_{\rm c}^{\rm lim} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-19}$. These constraints are in complementary frequency ranges to laboratory searches with CAST, OSQAR and ALPS II. We expect these limits to be improved both in reach and breadth with a more exhaustive use of telescope data across the full spectrum of frequencies and targets.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Dark Glueball Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New gauge forces can play an important role in the evolution of the early universe. In this work we investigate the cosmological implications of a pure Yang-Mills dark sector that is dominantly populated after primordial inflation. Such a dark sector takes the form of a bath of dark gluons at high temperatures, but confines at lower temperatures to produce a spectrum of dark glueballs. These glueballs then undergo a freezeout process such that the remnant population is nearly completely dominated by the lightest state. To reproduce the observed cosmology, this lightest glueball species must decay to the Standard Model to repopulate and reheat it. At leading order, this can occur through a connector operator of dimension-6. In contrast, other glueballs can be parametrically long-lived or stable, and remain as contributors to dark matter or modify the observed cosmology through their later decays. In this work we study the evolution of such dark sectors in detail. We demonstrate that stable remnant glueballs can produce the measured dark matter abundance. We also derive broad constraints on non-Abelian dark sectors from overproduction of remnant glueballs when they are stable or from their destructive impact when they are able to decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple extension to the Standard Model, wherein neutrinos naturally attain small Majorana masses through a one-loop radiative mechanism featuring particles within the loops characterized by milli-charges. Unlike the conventional scotogenic model, our approach avoids imposing a discrete symmetry or expanding the gauge sector. The minuscule electric charges ensure the stability of the lightest particle within the loop as a viable dark matter candidate. Our investigation systematically scrutinizes the far-reaching phenomenological implications arising from these minuscule charges.</description>

      <title>Not So Round: VLA Observations of the Starless Dark Matter Halo Candidate Cloud-9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations with FAST recently detected HI 21-cm emission near M94, revealing an intriguing object, Cloud-9, without an optical counterpart. Subsequent analysis suggests Cloud-9 is consistent with a gas-rich ($M_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{6} \ M_{\odot}$), starless dark matter (DM) halo of mass $M_{200} \approx 5 \times 10^{9} \ M_{\odot}$. Using VLA in D-array configuration, we present interferometric observations of Cloud-9 revealing it as a dynamically cold ($W_{50} \approx 12 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), non-rotating, and spatially-asymmetric system, exhibiting gas compression on one side and a tail-like structure towards the other, features likely originating from ram pressure. Our observations suggest Cloud-9 is consistent with a starless $\Lambda$CDM dark matter halo if the gas is largely isothermal. If interpreted as a faint dwarf, Cloud-9 is similar to Leo T, a nearby gas-rich galaxy that would fall below current optical detection limits at Cloud-9's distance ($d\approx 5 \rm \ Mpc$). Further observations with HST reaching magnitudes $m_{g} \approx 30$ would help identify such a galaxy or dramatically lower current limits to its stellar mass ($M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{5} \ M_{\odot}$). Cloud-9 thus stands as the firmest starless DM halo candidate to date or the faintest galaxy known at its distance.</description>

      <title>Cloud Crushing and Dissipation of Uniformly-Driven Adiabatic Turbulence in Circumgalactic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is responsive to kinetic disruptions generated by nearby astrophysical events. In this work, we study the saturation and dissipation of turbulent hydrodynamics within the CGM through an extensive array of 252 numerical simulations with a large parameter space. These simulations are endowed with proper cooling mechanisms to consistently explore the parameter space spanned by the average gas density, metallicity, and turbulence driving strength. A dichotomy emerges in the dynamics dissipation behaviors. Disturbances that are hot and subsonic are characterized by weak compression and slow dissipation, resulting in density fluctuations typically $\lesssim 10^{-2}$. Conversely, warm supersonic turbulence, marked by significant compression shocks and subsequent rapid cooling, is associated with substantial clumping factors $\sim 10^0-10^1$. In the supersonic cases, the kinetic energy decay is divided into a rate-limiting phase of shock dissipation and a comparatively swift phase of thermal dissipation, predominantly occurring within the overdense regions. Upon turbulence driving turnoff, the strong density contrasts decay within a relatively brief timescale of $\sim 30 - 300~{\rm Myr}$, depending on the average gas density. Dense clouds are crushed on similar timescales of $ \sim 30 - 100 ~{\rm Myr} $, depending on turbulence driving strength but independent from average gas density. Results of this work also contribute a novel dataset of dissipation timescales that incorporates an understanding of kinematics and thermodynamics in addition to the traditional cooling rate tables, which may serve as a valuable asset for forthcoming simulations that aim to explore gas dynamics on galactic and cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Axion Detection Experiments Meet the Majoron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majoron is a well-motivated light (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone) boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global lepton-number symmetry. In this {\it letter}, we relate the spontaneous breaking scale and its soft-breaking mass by requiring that the majoron is the main component of the dark matter. An electromagnetic-anomalous coupling can be induced by minimally modifying the original majoron model, surprisingly, predicting a parameter region that largely overlaps with the QCD-axion dark matter band. Thus, we expect that axion search experiments meet the majoron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of cosmological expansion on quantum bosonic states are investigated, using quantum information theory. In particular, a generic Bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field modes is considered and the state change on a single mode is regarded as the effect of a quantum channel. Properties and capacities of this channel are thus explored in the framework of $f(Q)$ theories. As immediate result, we obtain that the information on a single-mode state appears better preserved, whenever the number of particles produced by the cosmological expansion is small. Hence, similarly to general relativity, we show that analogous particle productions result even if we consider symmetric teleparallel gravity theories. Thus, we investigate a power law $f(Q)$ model, leaving unaltered the effective gravitational coupling, and minimise the corresponding particle production. We thus show how to optimise the preservation of classical and quantum information, stored in a bosonic mode states in the remote past. Finally, we compare our findings with those obtained in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Probing self-interacting ultra-high-energy neutrinos with cosmic 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the constraints on secret self-interactions of neutrinos by examining the impact of radiative scattering of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. These neutrinos are produced from the decay of superheavy dark matter and interact with the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). We explore how these interactions influence the 21-cm hydrogen signal during the cosmic dark ages and cosmic dawn, periods relatively free from astrophysical uncertainties, providing a clearer signal for studying non-standard neutrino interactions. By analyzing the global brightness temperature measurements, we constrain the scattering cross-section of UHE self-interacting neutrinos, determining the coupling constant $g$ to be within $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}$ for neutrino energies in the PeV to EeV range. Interestingly, these constraints are more competitive than those from existing astrophysical and collider experiments. As future 21-cm experiments focus on measuring brightness temperature across a wide range of redshifts from the cosmic dark ages to reionization, using the epoch of 21-cm to probe neutrino properties could provide crucial insights into dark matter and neutrino physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories formulated in the arena of teleparallel geometries are generically plagued by ghost-like instabilities or other pathologies that are ultimately caused by the breaking of some symmetries. In this work, we construct a class of ghost-free theories based on a symmetry under Transverse Diffeomorphisms that is naturally realised in symmetric teleparallelism. We explicitly show their equivalence to a family of theories with an extra scalar field plus a global degree of freedom and how Horndeski theories and healthy couplings to matter fields can be readily accommodated.</description>

      <title>Calibrating and standardizing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in the Small Magellanic Cloud using small-amplitude red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absolute calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and lower amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. B-sequence SARGs yield both the most precise and the brightest tip magnitude, and they are best suited for distance determination and Hubble constant measurements because they correspond to the oldest stars near TRGB. Assuming the geometric distance measured by detached eclipsing binaries, the B-sequence yields the SMC's most accurate TRGB calibration to date: M_{F814W,syn} = -4.057 \pm 0.019(stat.) \pm 0.029(syst.) mag (1.5% in distance). Further study of SARGs will unravel the impact of population diversity on TRGB distances and further improve TRGB standardization.</description>

      <title>Broad Absorption Line Quasars in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Early Data Release</title>

Abstract: Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are characterized by gas clouds that absorb flux at the wavelength of common quasar spectral features, although blueshifted by velocities that can exceed 0.1c. BAL features are interesting as signatures of significant feedback, yet they can also compromise cosmological studies with quasars by distorting the shape of the most prominent quasar emission lines, impacting redshift accuracy and measurements of the matter density distribution traced by the Lyman-alpha forest. We present a catalog of BAL quasars discovered in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey Early Data Release, which were observed as part of DESI Survey Validation, as well as the first two months of the main survey. We describe our method to automatically identify BAL quasars in DESI data, the quantities we measure for each BAL, and investigate the completeness and purity of this method with mock DESI observations. We mask the wavelengths of the BAL features and re-evaluate each BAL quasar redshift, finding new redshifts which are 243 km/s smaller on average for the BAL quasar sample. These new, more accurate redshifts are important to obtain the best measurements of quasar clustering, especially at small scales. Finally, we present some spectra of rarer classes of BALs that illustrate the potential of DESI data to identify such populations for further study.</description>

      <title>The Uchuu-GLAM BOSS and eBOSS LRG lightcones: Exploring clustering and covariance errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the clustering and bias of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) in the BOSS-LOWZ, -CMASS, -COMB, and eBOSS samples, using two types of simulated lightcones: (i) high-fidelity lightcones from Uchuu $N$-body simulation, employing SHAM technique to assign LRG to (sub)halos, and (ii) 16000 covariance lightcones from GLAM-Uchuu $N$-body simulations, including LRG using HOD data from Uchuu. Our results indicate that Uchuu and GLAM lightcones closely replicate BOSS/eBOSS data, reproducing correlation function and power spectrum across scales from redshifts $0.2$ to $1.0$, from $2$ to $150\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in configuration space, from $0.005$ to $0.7\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in Fourier space, and across different LRG stellar masses. Furthermore, comparing with existing MD-Patchy and EZmock BOSS/eBOSS lightcones based on approximate methods, our GLAM-Uchuu lightcones provide more precise clustering estimates. We identify significant deviations from observations within $20\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ scales in MD-Patchy and EZmock, with our covariance matrices indicating that these methods underestimate errors by between $10\%$ and $60\%$. Lastly, we explore the impact of cosmology on galaxy clustering. Our findings suggest that, given the current level of uncertainties in BOSS/eBOSS data, distinguishing models with and without massive neutrino effects on LSS is challenging. This paper highlights the Uchuu and GLAM-Uchuu simulations' robustness in verifying the accuracy of Planck cosmological parameters, providing a strong foundation for enhancing lightcone construction in future LSS surveys. We also demonstrate that generating thousands of galaxy lightcones is feasible using $N$-body simulations with adequate mass and force resolution.</description>

      <title>Inflation, the Hubble Tension and Early Dark Energy: an alternative overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review and discuss the possible implications for inflation resulting from considering new physics in light of the Hubble tension. My study is motivated by a simple argument that the constraints on inflationary parameters, most typically the spectral index $n_s$, depend to some extent on the cosmological framework. To avoid broadening the uncertainties resulting from marginalizing over additional parameters (typical in many alternative models), I first adopt the same alternative viewpoint of previous studies and analyze what happens if a physical theory can fix extra parameters to non-standard values. Focusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm{eff}}$, I confirm that physical theories able to fix $w \approx -1.2$ or $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.9$ produce values of $H_0$ from CMB and BAO in line with the local distance ladder estimate. While in the former case I do not find any relevant implications for inflation, in the latter scenarios, I observe a shift towards $n_s \approx 1$. From a model-selection perspective, both cases are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models with $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.3 - 3.4$ could bring the $H_0$ tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$ while being moderately disfavored. Yet, this is enough to change the constraints on inflation so that the most accredited models (e.g., Starobinsky inflation) would no longer be favored by data. I then focus on Early Dark Energy (EDE), arguing that an EDE fraction $f_{\rm{EDE}}\sim 0.04 - 0.06$ (only able to mildly reduce the $H_0$-tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$) could already require a similar change in perspective on inflation. In fact, performing a full joint analysis of EDE and Starobinsky inflation, I find that the two models can hardly coexist for $f_{\rm{EDE}}\gtrsim 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Impact of stellar population synthesis choices on forward modelling-based redshift distribution estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forward modelling of galaxy surveys has recently gathered interest as one of the primary methods to achieve the required precision on the estimate of the redshift distributions for stage IV surveys. One of the key aspects of forward modelling a galaxy survey is the connection between the physical properties drawn from a galaxy population model and the intrinsic SEDs, achieved through SPS codes (e.g. FSPS). However, SPS requires a large number of detailed assumptions on the constituents of galaxies, for which the model choice or parameter values are currently uncertain. In this work, we perform a sensitivity study of the impact that the variations of the SED modelling choices have on the mean and scatter of the tomographic galaxy redshift distributions. We assumed the Prospector beta model as the fiducial input galaxy population model and used its SPS parameters to build 9 bands magnitudes of a fiducial sample of galaxies. We then built samples of galaxy magnitudes by varying one SED modelling choice at a time. We modelled the colour redshift relation of these galaxy samples using the SOM approach. We placed galaxies in the SOM cells according to their observed frame colours and used their cell assignment to build colour selected tomographic bins. Finally, we compared each variant's binned redshift distributions against the estimates obtained for the fiducial model. We find that the SED components related to the IMF, AGNs, gas physics, and the attenuation law substantially bias the mean and the scatter of the tomographic redshift distributions with respect to those estimated with the fiducial model. Regardless of the applied stellar mass function based re-weighting strategy, the bias in the mean and the scatter of the tomographic redshift distributions are greater than the precision requirements set by next-generation Stage IV galaxy surveys, such as LSST and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Tele-Correlation: Calibrating Shear-Shear Correlation with Real Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tele-correlation refers to the correlation of galaxy shapes with large angular separations (e.g., $&gt;100$ degrees). Since there are no astrophysical reasons causing such a correlation on cosmological scales, any detected tele-correlation could disclose systematic effects in shear-shear correlation measurement. If the shear estimators are measured on single exposures, we show that the field distortion (FD) signal associated with the galaxy position on the CCD can be retained and used in tele-correlation to help us directly calibrate the multiplicative and additive biases in shear-shear correlations. We use the DECaLS shear catalog produced by the Fourier\_Quad pipeline to demonstrate this idea. To our surprise, we find that significant multiplicative biases can arise (up to more than 10\%) due to redshift binning of the galaxies. Correction for this bias leads to about 1$\sigma$ increase of the best-fit value of $S_8$ from $0.760^{+0.015}_{-0.017}$ to $0.777^{+0.016}_{-0.019}$ in our tomography study.</description>

Abstract: Context. Motivated by the recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in determining black hole (BH) parameters, we continue to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the supermassive BHs hosted at the core of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of the megamaser galaxies NGC 1320, NGC 1194, NGC 5495, and Mrk 1029. Aims. Our aim is to study the properties of super massive BHs at the centers of the selected AGNs by using a full general relativistic method that allows us to address the potential detection of relativistic effects within such astrophysical systems. Methods. In order to perform statistical estimations with publicly available observational data, we used a general relativistic model that describes BH rotation curves and further employed a Bayesian fitting method. Results. We estimated the mass-to-distance ratio of the aforementioned BHs, their position and the recessional redshifts of the host galaxies produced by both peculiar motion and cosmological expansion of the Universe. Finally, we calculated the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to the BH for each AGN. This gravitational redshift is a general relativistic effect produced by the gravitational field of the BH properly included in the modelling.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background: birth from string-wall death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new source of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from the final collapse of a network of topological defects. Typically, the final collapse is considered negligible for generating gravitational waves (GWs) due to its subdominance compared with the network's long-term evolution in the scaling regime. However, in some cases, a network can be driven outside of horizon by inflation and later re-enter horizon. Then, the network's final collapse after re-entering horizon becomes the dominant GW source and therefore cannot be neglected. We demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of $N_{\rm DW}=1$ string-wall networks which naturally arise in axion models, although the framework can be generalized to other types of topological networks. The final collapse of walls bounded by strings releases GWs. Our calculation of the corresponding GW spectrum suggests it could be related to the first few bins of the nano-Hertz SGWB signal possibly detected by various Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. However, it is important to note that such GW spectrum falls within a relatively narrow frequency range, which may not completely account for the PTA signal that spans more than one order of magnitude in frequency. Furthermore, with different parameter choices, the resultant GWs generated in this mechanism could be probed by various GW interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Symphony from Oscillating Spectator Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generic source of stochastic gravitational wave background due to the parametric resonance of oscillating scalar fields in the early Universe. By systematically analyzing benchmark models through lattice simulations and considering a wide range of parameters, we demonstrate that such a scenario can lead to detectable signals in gravitational wave detectors over a broad frequency range and potentially address the recent findings by pulsar timing array experiments. Furthermore, these models naturally yield ultralight dark matter candidates or dark radiation detectable by cosmic microwave background observatories.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration for TDiff scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the idea of restoring the full diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance in theories with only transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) by the introduction of additional fields. In particular, we consider in detail the case of a TDiff invariant scalar field and how Diff symmetry can be restored preserving locality by introducing an additional vector field. We reobtain the corresponding dynamics and energy-momentum tensor from the covariantized action and analyze the potential and kinetic domination regimes. For the former, the theory describes a cosmological constant-type behaviour, while for the latter we show that the theory can describe an adiabatic perfect fluid whose equation of state and speed of sound is obtained in a straightforward way. Furthermore, the reformulation with the full symmetry allows us to analyze the gravitational properties of the theory beyond those particular regimes. In particular, we find the general expression for the effective speed of sound of the non-adiabatic perfect fluid, which provides us with physically reasonable conditions that should be satisfied by the coupling functions. Finally, we investigate the particular models leading to an adiabatic fluid.</description>

      <title>Vector Wave Dark Matter and Terrestrial Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Ultra)light spin-$1$ particles -- dark photons -- can constitute all of dark matter (DM) and have beyond Standard Model couplings. This can lead to a coherent, oscillatory signature in terrestrial detectors that depends on the coupling strength. We provide a signal analysis and statistical framework for inferring the properties of such DM by taking into account (i) the stochastic and (ii) the vector nature of the underlying field, along with (iii) the effects due to the Earth's rotation. Owing to equipartition, on time scales shorter than the coherence time the DM field vector typically traces out a fixed ellipse. Taking this ellipse and the rotation of the Earth into account, we highlight a distinctive three-peak signal in Fourier space that can be used to constrain DM coupling strengths. Accounting for all three peaks, we derive latitude-independent constraints on such DM couplings, unlike those stemming from single-peak studies. We apply our framework to the search for ultralight $B - L$ DM using optomechanical sensors, demonstrating the ability to delve into previously unprobed regions of this DM candidate's parameter space.</description>
