      <title>Nascent chemical complexity in prestellar core IRAS 16293E: complex organics and deuterated methanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prestellar cores represent early sites of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) star and planet formation and provide insight into initial chemical conditions of complex organic molecules (COMs). Deuterated COMs trace the degree of molecular inheritance and/or reprocessing, as high deuteration in protostellar systems suggests COMs forming during the prestellar stage when deuteration is enhanced. Within the L1689N molecular cloud, the prestellar core IRAS 16293E sits $90^{"}$ eastward of the chemically-rich IRAS 16293-2422 A and B protostellar system. A unique view of star formation inside a common natal cloud, IRAS 16293A, B, and E all show some of the highest levels of deuteration in the ISM, with a number of D/H ratios $10^{5}$ times higher than Solar. We investigate for the first time the deuteration levels of the simplest COM, methanol (CH$_3$OH), in IRAS 16293E. Using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m telescope, we target favorable transitions of CH$_2$DOH, CHD$_2$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, and several higher complexity COMs (including acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the 3 mm band. Follow-up observations with the Yebes 40 m telescope provided additional transitions in the 7 mm (Q-band). We report the first detections of these COMs and deuterated methanol in prestellar core IRAS 16293E and use our observations to calculate excitation temperatures, column densities, and relative abundance ratios. Striking similarities are found between relative molecular ratios and D/H values when comparing IRAS 16293E to the A and B protostars, as well as to a heterogeneous sample of other prestellar cores, protostars, and the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Our results support the idea that there is a limited amount of chemical reprocessing of COMs when prestellar cores collapse and heat-up during the protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>A Turbulent Framework for Star Formation in High-Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of distant galaxies suggest that the physics of galaxy formation at high redshifts differs significantly from later times. In contrast to large, steady disk galaxies like the Milky Way, high-redshift galaxies are often characterized by clumpy, disturbed morphologies and bursty star formation histories. These differences between low-mass, bursty galaxies and higher-mass, steady star-forming galaxies have recently been studied in galaxy formation simulations with resolved multiphase ISM. These simulation studies indicate that while steady disk galaxies can be well-modeled as "equilibrium disks" embedded in a distinct, hot CGM, bursty galaxies are much more dynamic and their star formation occurs in a dispersion-dominated medium that extends to halo scales, with no clear boundary between the ISM and the CGM. We develop an analytic framework to model star formation in bursty galaxies that are not adequately modeled as equilibrium disks. The framework approximates the gas in low-mass halos as a continuous, supersonically turbulent medium with large density fluctuations. Star formation occurs locally in the high-density tail of a roughly lognormal density distribution. This is analogous to turbulent models of star formation in molecular clouds, but here applied on inner CGM scales. By comparing with galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project, we show that this framework can be used to understand star formation efficiencies and radial profiles in halos. The turbulent framework shows explicitly how the instantaneous galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency can be relatively low even if the local efficiency in dense gas approaches unity.</description>

      <title>JVLA and VLBA study of the merging cool core CHIPS 1911+4455 at z~0.5: radio emission from an infant AGN and from a rapidly star-forming BCG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of galaxy clusters found peculiar cases at the boundary between non-cool core and cool core systems. While unusual, these objects can help us understand the evolution of the most massive clusters. We investigated the role of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the starburst brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the merging cool core cluster CHIPS 1911+4455 (z = 0.485). We conducted new multifrequency (0.3 - 5 GHz) Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations of CHIPS 1911+4455 across a wide range of scales (0.01 to 20 kpc). Our analysis reveals that the AGN in the BCG has recently awakened, showing a compact core with symmetric, ~30 pc long jets in VLBA data. The onset of the AGN may be linked to the enhanced cooling of the hot gas found in a previous study. At larger scales (10 kpc), faint radio whiskers extending to the south show a striking alignment with star-forming knots and are thus interpreted as synchrotron-emitting regions associated with the starburst BCG. The implied radio star formation rate of 100 - 155 M$_{\odot}$/yr agrees with the optical/infrared one (140 - 190 M$_{\odot}$/yr). Our JVLA and VLBA radio study, informed by previous X-ray/optical/millimeter works, indicates that CHIPS 1911+4455 represents a transitional phase in cluster evolution, where the AGN in the central galaxy has just begun to respond to copious hot gas cooling.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Milky Way dark matter halo with LMC-induced reflex motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling perturbations of the Milky Way (MW) halo induced by the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers new avenues to constrain the dark matter (DM) distribution in our Galaxy. A key observable is the reflex motion of the MW disc with respect to the halo induced by the LMC's infall, which imprints a velocity dipole on kinematics of halo stars. Here we investigate how the dipole varies with Galactocentric radius, and study the sensitivity of the reflex motion signal to different DM outer-halo profiles. Using a suite of basis function expansion (BFE) simulations with truncated NFW profiles ($\rho \propto r^{-\beta}$ beyond $r=50$ kpc), our $N$-body models show that (i) The reflex motion amplitude varies with Galactocentric radius but is largely insensitive to the outer DM slope, implying that the MW-LMC mass ratio alone does not set the dipole strength. (ii) In contrast, the direction of the disc motion is very sensitive to the density distribution of the outer DM halo. (iii) The contraction of the MW halo induced by the LMC's gravitational pull also depends strongly on the outer DM halo profile. (iv) We find a halo instability whose oscillation frequency increases with $\beta$ producing a potentially observable signature - a sinusoidal pattern of the mean radial velocity of halo stars. Finally, using BFE coefficients we find that steeper truncations produce smaller dipole distortions, while amplifying the quadrupole distortion. These results highlight the limited constraining power of the reflex motion amplitude alone for outer MW profile parameters.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of galaxies and the UV Luminosity Function from $z\sim6$ to $z\sim14$ in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) in three redshift bins over $z\sim5.5$-14 from the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Our samples, selected using the dropout technique in the HST/ACS F814W, JWST/NIRCam F115W, and F150W filters, contain a total of 3099 galaxies spanning a wide luminosity range from faint ($M_{\rm UV}\sim-19$ mag) to bright ($M_{\rm UV}\sim-22.5$ mag). The galaxies are undergoing rapid star formation, with blue stellar populations. Surprisingly, their median UV spectral slope $\beta$ does not evolve at $z&gt;8$, suggesting minimal dust, or physical separation of dust and star formation at early epochs. The measured UVLF exhibits an excess at the bright-end ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-21$ mag) compared to pre-JWST empirical results and theoretical predictions of an evolving Schechter function, with the excess beginning at $z\sim9$ and becoming increasingly prominent toward $z\sim12$. Our analysis suggests that reproducing the observed abundance of UV-bright galaxies at high redshift requires a combination of physical processes, including elevated star formation efficiencies, moderate levels of stochasticity in galaxy luminosities, and minimal dust attenuation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Accuracy of Reionization Prescriptions in Semi-analytic Models of the First Stars and Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-analytic models are a valuable tool to study the first stars and galaxies. Their numerical efficiency makes it possible to survey broad regions of astrophysical parameter space across large volumes and redshift ranges. Following reionization in these models is necessary since star formation is suppressed in ionized regions due to photoheating of the gas. Here we evaluate the accuracy of three semi-analytic reionization prescriptions (two previously developed and one new model) by comparing their three-dimensional distribution of ionized bubbles to the Renaissance hydrodynamical cosmological radiative transfer simulations. We find that the previously existing models accurately determine the distribution of the larger bubbles within our ${\sim}6$ comoving Mpc simulation box, but that these models fail to take into account self-shielded neutral gas in dense filaments. Thus, these prescriptions overestimate the fraction of halos in HII regions impacted by reionization feedback by up to an order of magnitude (depending on halo mass and redshift). This leads to an unrealistically large effect of reionization feedback on Pop III stars and low-mass metal-enriched galaxies. Our newly developed model takes into account the density structure of the cosmic web, leading to good agreement with Renaissance in the fraction of halos found in ionized regions.</description>

      <title>AGN Feedback Models and AGN Demographics I: Radio-Mode AGN in EAGLE, SIMBA and TNG100 are Inconsistent with Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare predictions of how Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) populate host galaxies at low redshifts to observations, finding large discrepancies between cosmological simulation predictions and observed patterns. Modern cosmological simulations include AGN feedback models tuned to reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function. However, due to a lack of real understanding of the physics of AGN feedback, these models vary significantly across simulations. To distinguish between the models and potentially test the underlying physics, we carry out independent tests of these models. In an earlier study, we found that $F_{\rm AGN}$ -- the observed completeness-corrected fraction of galaxies hosting radio AGN with an Eddington ratio $\lambda &gt; 10^{-3}$ -- to be a strong function of host galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) but nearly independent of host specific star formation rates (sSFR) at fixed $M_\star$. In this study, we test the radio mode AGN feedback models of the EAGLE, SIMBA, and TNG100 simulations by comparing their predictions of $F_{\rm AGN} \left(M_\star \right)$ to our observational constraint. We find that none of these simulations even qualitatively reproduce the observed dependencies of $F_{\rm AGN}$ on $M_\star$ and sSFR. Finally, we find that although the given TNG100 model could be modified in order to better reproduce the observed $F_{\rm AGN}$ trend, this modification would likely also change its prediction for the local stellar mass function and star formation rates -- key observations used for calibrating the simulation in the first place. Our findings highlight a pressing need to revisit the AGN feedback prescriptions in EAGLE, SIMBA, TNG100 and other similar models.</description>

      <title>Probing Dust and PAH Chemistry in Evolved Carbon-Rich Nebulae through Optical and Infrared Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents optical and near-infrared photometric observations, alongside mid-infrared spectroscopic data from the ISO SWS instrument, to examine potential correlations between Aromatic Infrared Band (AIB) features and the optical properties of carbon-rich evolved stars. Identifying such correlations can provide valuable constraints on the evolutionary pathways of low- to intermediate-mass stars beyond the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Photometric measurements in the U, B, V, R, I, J, H, K, and L bands were obtained for five well-known carbon-rich objects at various post-AGB or planetary nebula (PN) stages: CRL 2688, PN M 2-43, NGC 7027, BD${+}$30${^\circ}$3639, and AFGL 2132. Our analysis reveals that all five objects exhibit prominent AIB features; however, their spectral profiles show notable variation. These differences are attributed to variations in the chemical composition and physical conditions of the surrounding circumstellar material. In particular, the 3.28$\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature is detected in all objects except AFGL 2132, indicating a potentially distinct PAH population or environmental condition in its vicinity. Although these sources share broadly similar evolutionary stages, the observed diversity in AIB characteristics underscores the complexity and heterogeneity of their circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>The Size Evolution and the Size-Mass Relation of Lyman-Alpha Emitters across $3 \lesssim z &lt; 7$ as Observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the morphological structures of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) is crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of Ly$\alpha$ emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of 876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3 \lesssim z &lt; 7$, selected from the MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. Utilizing deep, high-resolution near-infrared images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$) through two-dimensional S\'{e}rsic profile fitting. Our results show that these LAEs are generally compact with weak size evolution, following $R_{\rm e,UV} \propto (1 + z)^{-0.91 \pm 0.10}$ and $R_{\rm e,V} \propto (1 + z)^{-0.93 \pm 0.18}$, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients. For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for LAEs at $z&gt;3$, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results provide important clues for understanding the formation mechanisms and structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Modeling of Supernova Remnants Collisions: Implications for Triggered Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, particularly those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.</description>

      <title>DAWN. I. Simulating the formation and early evolution of stellar clusters with Phantom N-Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is numerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and their surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims. This paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early stellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework which is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling statistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics community, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been added to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded cluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star formation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is consistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region expansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run testcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from the cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their function by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel implementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that massive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics of the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and the strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the cloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming low-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical studies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient simulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the statistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of embedded star clusters.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity at z~2-3 with JWST/NIRISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity maps are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We present spatially resolved metallicity maps obtained from NIRISS/WFSS observations. This is the first such work presenting multiple individual galaxies. We investigate the source of ionisation, metallicity and its relation to star-formation in a spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies -- four from JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the redshift range $1.9 \leq z \leq 2$, the outlier being at $z = 3.1$. Our sample covers a range of $8.0 &lt;$ \logM $&lt; 9.5$ in stellar mass, $0.2 &lt;$ $\log{\rm{(SFR}}$/\Msunpyr) $&lt; 1.1$ in star-formation rate (SFR) and $7.8 &lt;$ \logOH $&lt; 9.0$ in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN demarcation in absence of resolved \halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation line in the \textit{OHNO} parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly available \hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps hinting at the fact that the high-$z$ galaxies have not yet started their accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Metallicity of Active Galactic Nuclei from ultraviolet and optical emission lines-II. Revisiting the $C43$ metallicity calibration and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a new semi-empirical calibration is proposed between ultraviolet emission lines (\ion{C}{iii}]$\lambda1909$, \ion{C}{iv}$\lambda1549$, \ion{He}{ii}]$\lambda1640$) of type~2 AGNs and their metallicity ($Z$). This calibration is derived by comparing a large sample of 106 objects (data taken from the literature) located over a wide range of redshifts ($0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 4.0$) with predictions from photoionization models that adopt a recent C/O-O/H relation derived via estimates using the $T_{\rm e}$ method, which is considered the most reliable method. We found that the new calibration produces $Z$ values in agreement (within an uncertainty of $\pm 0.1$ dex) with those from other calibrations and from estimates via the $T_{\rm e}$-method. We find also that AGN metallicities are already high at early epochs, with no evidence for monotonic evolution across the redshift range $0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 12$. Notably, the highest metallicities in our sample, reaching up to $\rm 4\: Z_{\odot}$, are found in objects at $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$. This redshift range coincides with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate history, suggesting a strong connection between the major epoch of star formation, black hole growth, and rapid metal enrichment in the host galaxies of AGNs. Furthermore, our analysis reveals no significant correlation between AGN metallicity and radio properties (radio spectral index or radio luminosity) or host galaxy stellar mass. The lack of a clear mass-metallicity relation, consistent with findings for local AGNs, suggests that the chemical evolution of the nuclear gas is decoupled from the global properties of the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>First detection of circular polarization in 4.7 GHz excited OH masers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of circular polarization in 4.7 GHz excited OH masers in star-forming regions made using full Stokes measurements with the Green Bank 100m telescope. The Zeeman shift between the two circular components provides a measure of the magnetic field pervading these maser spots. Three different methods are used to determine the shift in velocity between the Right Circular Polarization and Left Circular Polarization components. We find fields with $B \sim 100$ mG using archival molecular parameters that have limited precision and uncertain values. Reservations of using 1.7 and 6.0 GHz OH masers to estimate magnetic fields in star-forming regions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Long-period variable stars in NGC 147 and NGC 185-II. Their dust production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of mass-loss and dust-production rates in the dwarf galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185, focusing on long-period variables (LPVs) and pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars as primary indicators of dust feedback into the interstellar medium. For NGC 147, the total mass-loss rate is calculated as $(9.44 \pm 3.78) \times 10^{-4} M_{sun} yr^{-1}$, with LPV luminosities ranging from $(6.20 \pm 0.25) \times 10^{2} L_\odot$ to $( 7.87 \pm 0.32) \times 10^{3} L_\odot $. In NGC 185, the total mass-loss rate is higher, at $(1.58 \pm 0.63) \times 10^{-3} M_{sun} yr^{-1}$, with LPV luminosities spanning $ (5.68 \pm 0.23) \times 10^{2} L_\odot $ to $(1.54 \pm 0.66) \times 10^{4} L_\odot$. A positive correlation is observed between stellar luminosity, intrinsic reddening due to circumstellar dust self-extinction, and elevated mass-loss rates. Additionally, comparisons of calculated dust injection rates, two-dimensional dust distribution maps, and observed dust masses provide evidence for a gravitational interaction between NGC 147 and the Andromeda galaxy, which influences the dust distribution within the system.</description>

      <title>Cornelis Easton:The Milky Way as a spiral galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cornelis Easton (1864-1929) became a journalist and newspaper editor. During most of his career he was active as an amateur astronomer and contributed important papers in international astronomical journals This concerned three areas. The first was mapping the Milky Way. The book, La Voie Lactee dans l'hemisphere boreal, which he published in 1893, made some impression. Since it had in addition to drawings of the surface brightness of the Milky Way, also extensive descriptions and discussions of features in the structure and a comprehensive, essentially complete, listing and discussion on everything that had ever been published on the Milky Way. Later he produce an isophotal chart and used photographs to improve the map. Easton had been struck by the idea that what he saw was actually a spiral nebula, but then seen edge-on. Considering bright and dark areas he proposed a form for the spiral in the Milky Way System with the center in the direction of the constellation Cygnus. His publications on this Theory of the Milky Way in the Astrophysical Journal in 1900 and 1913 drew much attention, although many astronomers, including Jacobus Kapteyn, kept quite some reservations.
  The third area concerned correlations between surface densities of stars and surface brightness of the Milky Way. Easton maintained that there was such a correlation for relatively bright stars. T
  There is a publication Easton failed to include in his list of his publications, namely an 1894 short article in Nature. The elliptical companion NGC205 of the Andromeda Nebula between had on in 1874 and 1889 rotated by 15 degrees. Isophote twists are responsible for the apparent rotation.
  In 1903 Kapteyn and the University of Groningen bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Easton.</description>

      <title>Polarization of reflected X-ray emission from Sgr A molecular complex: multiple flares, multiple sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended X-ray emission observed in the direction of several molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy exhibits spectral and temporal properties consistent with the `X-ray echo' scenario. It postulates that the observed signal is a light-travel-time delayed reflection of a short ($\delta t&lt;$1.5 yr) and bright ($L_{\rm X}&gt;10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) flare, most probably produced a few hundred years ago by Sgr A*. This scenario also predicts a distinct polarization signature for the reflected X-ray continuum, with the polarization vector being perpendicular to the direction towards the primary source and polarization degree (PD) being determined by the scattering angle. We report the results of two deep observations of the currently brightest (in reflected emission) molecular complex Sgr A taken with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in 2022 and 2023. We confirm the previous polarization measurement for a large region encompassing Sgr A complex with higher significance, but also reveal an inconsistent polarization pattern for the brightest reflection region in its center. X-ray polarization from this region is almost perpendicular to the expected direction in the case of Sgr A* illumination and shows a smaller PD compared to the large region. This could indicate the simultaneous propagation of several illumination fronts throughout the CMZ, with the origin of one of them not being Sgr A*. The primary source could be associated with the Arches stellar cluster or a currently unknown source located in the closer vicinity of the illuminated cloud, potentially lowering the required luminosity of the primary source. Although significantly deeper observations with IXPE would be required to unequivocally distinguish between the scenarios, a combination of high-resolution imaging and micro-calorimetric spectroscopy offers an additional promising path forward.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029 Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.</description>

      <title>CLASH-VLT: The variance of the velocity anisotropy profiles of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The velocity anisotropy profiles, $\beta(r)$, of galaxy clusters are directly related to the shape of the orbits of their member galaxies. Knowledge of $\beta(r)$ is important to understand the assembly process of clusters and the evolutionary processes of their galaxies, and to improve the determination of cluster masses based on cluster kinematics. We determine the $\beta(r)$ of nine massive clusters at redshift $0.19 \leq z \leq 0.45$ from the CLASH-VLT data set, with 150 to 950 spectroscopic members each, to understand how much cluster-to-cluster variance exists in the $\beta(r)$ of different clusters and what is the main driver of this variance. We select spectroscopic cluster members with the CLUMPS algorithm calibrated on cosmological simulations. We apply the MAMPOSSt code to the distribution of cluster members in projected phase-space to constrain the cluster mass profile, $M(r)$, using priors derived from a previous gravitational lensing analysis. Given the MAMPOSSt best-fit solution for $M(r)$, we then solve the inversion of the Jeans equation to determine $\beta(r)$ without assumptions of its functional form. We also run the DS+ code to identify subclusters and characterize the dynamical status of our clusters. The average $\beta(r)$ is slightly radial, with the anisotropy increasing from $\beta \simeq 0.2$ at the cluster center, to $\beta \simeq 0.4$ at the virial radius. There is substantial variance in the $\beta(r)$ of the individual clusters, that cannot be entirely accounted for by the observational uncertainties. Clusters of lower mass and with a low concentration per given mass have more tangential $\beta(r)$'s. Clusters hosting a rich subcluster have $\beta(r)$ deviating more strongly from the average $\beta(r)$.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XV. Updated calibrations of fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>The impact of galaxy bias on cross-correlation tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cross-correlation of galaxies at different redshifts with other tracers of the large-scale structure can be used to reconstruct the cosmic mean of key physical quantities, and their evolution over billions of years, at high precision. However, a correct interpretation of these measurements must ensure that they are independent of the clustering properties of the galaxy sample used. In this paper we explore different prescriptions to extract tomographic reconstruction measurements and use the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations to show that a robust estimator, independent of the small-scale galaxy bias, can be constructed. We focus on the tomographic reconstruction of the halo bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle bP_e\rangle$ and star-formation density $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$, which can be reconstructed from tomographic analysis of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background maps, respectively. We show that these quantities can be reconstructed with an accuracy of 1-3\% over a wide range of redshifts, using different galaxy samples. We also show that these measurements can be accurately interpreted using the halo model, assuming a sufficiently reliable model can be constructed for the halo mass function, large-scale halo bias, and for the dependence of the physical quantities being reconstructed on halo mass.</description>

Abstract: The first interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov and 3I/ATLAS, were discovered over the past decade. We follow the trajectories of known interstellar objects in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy to constrain their possible origin. We perform Monte Carlo orbital integrations using 10,000 trajectory ensembles per object to properly account for measurement uncertainties in both object velocities and Solar motion parameters. We implement a Bayesian statistical framework that combines a Rayleigh-like likelihood function with star formation rate priors to infer stellar ages from the maximum vertical excursions ($z_{\text{max}}$) of orbital trajectories. The likelihood function incorporates age-dependent velocity dispersions reflecting the thin-thick disk transition and dynamical heating over galactic history. Our Monte Carlo analysis yields median $z_{\text{max}}$ values of 0.016 $\pm$ 0.002 kpc for 1I/`Oumuamua, 0.121 $\pm$ 0.010 kpc for 2I/Borisov, and 0.480 $\pm$ 0.020 kpc for 3I/ATLAS. The Bayesian age inference indicates that 1I/`Oumuamua originated from a young stellar system (1.0 Gyr, 68\% CI: 0.1-4.1 Gyr), 2I/Borisov from an intermediate-age population (3.8 Gyr, 68\% CI: 1.8-5.9 Gyr), and 3I/ATLAS from an old thick-disk source (9.6 Gyr, 68\% CI: 7.8-10.3 Gyr). These results demonstrate clear age discrimination where smaller vertical excursions correspond to younger stellar origins.</description>

Abstract: Aims. We introduce the SISSI (Supernovae In a Stratified, Shearing Interstellar medium) simulation suite, which aims to enable a more comprehensive understanding of supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a complex interstellar medium (ISM) structured under the influence of galactic rotation, gravity and turbulence. Methods. We utilize zoom-in simulations of 30 SNRs expanding in the ISM of a simulated isolated disk galaxy. The ISM of the galaxy is resolved down to a maximum resolution of $\sim 12\,\text{pc}$, while we achieve a zoomed-in resolution of $\sim 0.18\, \text{pc}$ in the vicinity of the explosion sources. We compute the time-evolution of the SNRs' geometry and compare it to the observed geometry of the Local Bubble. Results. During the early stages of evolution, SNRs are well described by existing analytical models. On longer timescales, starting at about a percent of the orbital timescale, they depart from spherical symmetry and become increasingly prolate or oblate. The timescale for the departure from spherical symmetry is shorter than the expectation from a simple model for the deformation by galactic shear, suggesting that galactic shear alone cannot explain these differences. Yet, the alignment of the minor- and major axis of the SNRs is in line with expectations from said model, indicating that the deformation might have a shear-related origin. A comparison with the geometry of the Local Bubble reveals that it might be slightly younger than previously believed, but otherwise has a standard morphology for a SNR of its age and size. Conclusions. Studying the geometry of SNRs can reveal valuable insights about the complex interactions shaping their dynamical evolution. Future studies targeting the geometry of Galactic SNRs may use this insight to obtain a clearer picture of the processes shaping the Galactic ISM.</description>

      <title>Recovering the pattern speeds of edge-on barred galaxies via an orbit-superposition method</title>

Abstract: We developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies and evaluated its capability to recover the bar pattern speed $\rm\Omega_p$. We selected three simulated galaxies (Au-18, Au-23, and Au-28) with known pattern speeds from the Auriga simulations and created MUSE-like mock data sets with edge-on views (inclination angles $\theta_{\rm T}\ge85^\circ$) and various bar azimuthal angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$. For mock data sets with side-on bars ($\varphi_{\rm T}\ge50^\circ$), the model-recovered pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_p$ encompass the true pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_T$ within the model uncertainties ($1\sigma$ confidence levels, $68\%$) for 10 of 12 cases. The average model uncertainty within the $1\sigma$ confidence levels is equal to $10\%$. For mock data sets with end-on bars ($\varphi_{\rm T}\le30^\circ$), the model uncertainties of $\rm\Omega_p$ depend significantly on the bar azimuthal angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$, with the uncertainties of cases with $\varphi_{\rm T}=10^\circ$ approaching $\sim30\%$. However, by imposing a stricter constraint on the bar morphology ($p_{\rm bar}\le0.50$), the average uncertainties are reduced to $14\%$ , and $\rm\Omega_p$ still encompass $\rm\Omega_T$ within the model uncertainties for three of four cases. For all the models that we create in this paper, the $2\sigma$ ($95\%$) confidence levels of the model-recovered pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_p$ always cover the true values $\rm\Omega_T$.</description>

      <title>H${\beta}$ line shape and radius-luminosity relation in 2.5D FRADO</title>

Abstract: Galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit broad emission lines as a key spectral feature. The shape of emission-line profiles depends on the complex dynamics of discrete clouds within a spatially extended region known as the Broad Line Region (BLR). The distribution of cloud positions within BLR, or the geometry of BLR indeed, is directly linked to measurements of time lags of BLR. In this paper, we convolve a large grid of physically-based simulations of cloud distributions in BLR with photon-flux weighted emissivity of BLR clouds to investigate the generic shape of spectral line profiles. More importantly, we extract the time-delay histograms of corresponding models to calculate the size of BLR. Our physical model is based on the assumption that the clouds are launched by the radiation pressure acting on dust in the atmosphere of the outer disk. It has very few global parameters. The model is appropriate for the low ionization part of the BLR, as it was shown by earlier model tests. It uses a non-hydrodynamical single-cloud approach to the BLR dynamics. In this way we simulate the distribution of positions and velocities of the clouds. We found that the width of line profiles gets broader with black hole mass, or with viewing angle, and gets narrower with accretion rate. The blue wing of the emission line profiles becomes more pronounced with increasing black hole mass and accretion rate, consistent with the formation and intensification of an outflow structure. We also found that the peak time-delays rather than averaged delay values better represents the observational trend and also the scatter in the radius-luminosity relation.</description>

      <title>A 13-Billion-Year View of Galaxy Growth: Metallicity Gradient Evolution from the Local Universe to $z=9$ with JWST and Archival Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The galaxy gas-phase metallicity gradients have been extensively studied over the past four decades, both in the local and high-redshift universe, as they trace the baryon cycle and growth of galaxies. With the unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of JWST, it is now possible to measure metallicity and its radial gradients out to redshifts as high as $z = 9$. Here, we present a sample of 455 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from redshifts $1.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$ that are spatially resolved on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales by deep JWST NIRCam or NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS). Synthesizing these new JWST observations with legacy observations from the literature, we observe that at redshift $z &gt; 5$, galaxy centers are more metal-rich, exhibiting negative metallicity gradients of $\sim-0.4$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. These gradients flatten over time, reaching near-zero around $z \approx 2$, coinciding with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. Beyond this point, the gradients become negative again at lower redshifts approaching $z=0$. This evolution likely reflects transitions in galaxy formation modes: an inside-out growth phase dominated by intense central star formation with inefficient feedback and limited gas mixing during ``cosmic dawn", enhanced gas mixing due to feedback-driven wind and gas accretion at ``cosmic noon", and a later phase of slow evolution and reduced feedback toward the present day. These physical processes, including gas accretion and feedback, not only regulate star and galaxy formation on a cosmic scale but also shape the evolutionary pathways of individual galaxies over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>JWST+ALMA reveal the build up of stellar mass in the cores of dusty star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>

Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies have long been suspected to serve as the missing evolutionary bridge between the star-forming and quiescent phases of massive galaxy evolution. With the combined power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible to use high resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR), and rest-submm wavelengths to study the multi-wavelength morphologies tracing both the stellar populations and dust within this key phase. We present the joint analysis of JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by ALMA for a sample of 33 galaxies at $z$=1.5 to $z$=5.5 selected from the 1.1mm GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the morphologies of this population to mass and redshift selected samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The 1.1mm-selected sample are morphologically distinct from other similarly massive star-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-wavelength gradient from 1.5-4.4$\mu$m, with a more dramatic decrease in size towards longer wavelengths. While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the 1.1mm-selected galaxies are brighter in the inner regions relative to the field star-forming population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent population. These morphological differences could suggest that dusty star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming galaxies, have already built up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading to extended and clumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in the rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already established, we speculate that mm-selected galaxies may imminently evolve to join their quiescent descendants.</description>

      <title>Jet collimation in a spiral-hosted AGN: a parabolic jet profile in 0313-192</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-lobed radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) are typically found in elliptical galaxies, while supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies rarely produce powerful kpc-scale jets. However, the growing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical dichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such source, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across nearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\sim$ pc to $\sim100$ kpc (projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\sim 610$ pc ($\sim 7.9 \times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition to a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates from the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles those in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how the jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic collimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\sim7.3\times10^{5} R_{S}$), and no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to provide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet confinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal components, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These mechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas. Our results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under rare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet formation beyond traditional models.</description>

      <title>Detecting Axion-Like Particles with Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gamma-ray experiments, such as the e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO telescopes, can detect the Hawking radiation of photons from primordial black holes (PBHs) if they make up a fraction or all of dark matter. PBHs can analogously also Hawking radiate new particles, which is especially interesting if these particles are mostly secluded from the Standard Model (SM) sector, since they might therefore be less accessible otherwise. A well-motivated example of this type is axion-like particles (ALPs) with a tiny coupling to photons. We assume that the ALPs produced by PBHs decay into photons well before reaching the earth, so these will augment the photons directly radiated by the PBHs. Remarkably, we find that the peaks in the energy distributions of ALPs produced from PBHs are different than the corresponding ones for Hawking radiated photons due to the spin-dependent greybody factor. Therefore, we demonstrate that this process will in fact distinctively modify the PBHs' gamma-ray spectrum relative to the SM prediction. We use monochromatic asteroid-mass PBHs as an example to show that e-ASTROGAM can observe the PBH-produced ALP gamma-ray signal (for masses up to ~60 MeV) and further distinguish it from Hawking radiation without ALPs. By measuring the gamma-ray signals, e-ASTROGAM can thereby probe yet unexplored parameters in the ALP mass and photon coupling.</description>

Abstract: We present the calibration procedures and validation of source measurement with the data of the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS) for \HI intensity mapping by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). Using 70-hour drift-scan observation with the L-band (1.05-1.45GHz) 19-beam receiver, we obtain the data covering $270\,\rm deg^2$ sky area. We employ both the pulsar backend and the spectrum backend to calibrate the spectral time-ordered-data (TOD) before projecting them onto HEALPix maps. We produce calibrated TOD with frequency resolution of 30kHz and time resolution of 1s and the map data-cube with frequency resolution of 30kHz and spatial resolution of $2.95\,\rm arcmin^2$. We examine the pointing errors, noise overflow, RFI contamination and their effect on the data quality. The resulting noise level is $\sim$ 5.7mJy for the calibrated TOD and 1.6mJy for the map, consistent with the theoretical predictions within 5\% at RFI-free channels. We also validate the data by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and find the residual map looks thermal noise dominated after removing 30 modes. We identify 447 isolated bright continuum sources in our data matching the NRAO-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalog, with relative flux error of 8.3\% for TOD and 6.6\% for the map-level. We also measure the \HI emission of 90 galaxies with redshift $z&lt;0.07$ and compare with \HI-MaNGA spectra, yielding an overall relative \HI integral flux error of 16.7\%. These results provide an important first step in assessing the feasibility of conducting cosmological \HI detection with CRAFTS.</description>

Abstract: The first generation of transiting planet searches in globular clusters yielded no detections, and in hindsight, only placed occurrence rate limits slightly higher than the measured occurrence rate in the higher-metallicity Galactic thick disk. To improve these limits, we present the first results of a new wide field search for transiting hot Jupiters in the globular cluster 47~Tucanae. We have observed 47~Tuc as part of the Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha Planets (MISHAPS). Using 24 partial and full nights of observations taken with the Dark Energy Camera on the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO, we perform a search on 19,930 stars in the outer regions of the cluster. Though we find no clear planet detections, by combining our result with the upper limit enabled by Gilliland et al.'s 2000 Hubble search for planets around an independent sample of 34,091 stars in the inner cluster, we place the strongest limit to date on hot Jupiters with periods of $0.8 \leq P \leq 8.3$ days and $0.5~R_{\rm Jup} \leq R_{\rm P} \leq 2.0~R_{\rm Jup}$ of $f_{\rm HJ} &lt; 0.11\%$, a factor of ${\sim}$4 below the occurrence rate in the \textit{Kepler} field. Our search found 35 transiting planet candidates, though we are ultimately able to rule out each without follow-up observations. We also found 4 eclipsing binaries, including 3 previously-uncataloged detached eclipsing binary stars.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Eddington and Malmquist Biases in Latent-Inclination Inference of the Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tully-Fisher relation is a vital distance indicator, but its precise inference is challenged by selection bias, statistical bias, and uncertain inclination corrections. This study presents a Bayesian framework that simultaneously addresses these issues. To eliminate the need for individual inclination corrections, inclination is treated as a latent variable with a known probability distribution. To correct for the distance-dependent Malmqvist bias arising from sample selection, the model incorporates Gaussian scatter in the dependent variable, the distribution of the independent variable, and the observational selection function into the data likelihood. To mitigate the statistical bias -- termed the ``general Eddington bias'' -- caused by Gaussian scatter and the non-uniform distribution of the independent variable, two methods are introduced: (1) analytical bias corrections applied to the dependent variable before likelihood computation, and (2) a dual-scatter model that accounts for Gaussian scatter in the independent variable within the likelihood function. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using simulated datasets. By rigorously addressing selection and statistical biases in a latent-variable regression analysis, this work provides a robust approach for unbiased distance estimates from standardizable candles, which is critical for improving the accuracy of Hubble constant determinations.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture, with Possible Application to Chondrites and Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>The Kinematic Age of 3I/ATLAS and its Implications for Early Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the third interstellar object (3I/ATLAS) expands the known census from two to three and significantly improves statistical inferences regarding the underlying galactic population. In this paper, we argue that cometary activity likely significantly contributes to 3I/ATLAS's brightness, since the nuclear size inferred when assuming an asteroidal reflectance implies an untenable interstellar object mass per star. 3I/ATLAS exhibits a high excess velocity of $v_\infty=58$ km/s relative to the Sun, which implies that 3I/ATLAS is relatively old in comparison to previous interstellar objects. Here, we calculate the posterior distribution of ages implied by the kinematics of the interstellar objects and find that 3I/ATLAS is likely $\sim3-11$ Gyr old, assuming that the interstellar object and stellar age-velocity dispersion relations are equivalent. We also calculate the distribution of host star metallicities and find that 3I/ATLAS has a 12% chance of originating from a star with $\text{[Fe/H]}\leq-0.4$. These results show that interstellar object formation is likely efficient at low metallicities and early in the history of the Galaxy. Finally, we estimate the interstellar object formation rate throughout Galactic history implied by these three objects. As future interstellar objects are discovered, the framework presented here can be applied to further refine this calculation. Comparison between the interstellar object and stellar formation histories will provide unique insights into the history of stellar system formation in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The nebular phase of SN 2024ggi: a low-mass progenitor with no signs of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Spectral Characteristics of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from SOAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) provide unique insights into the building blocks and conditions of extrasolar planetary systems. The newly discovered object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), represents the third known ISO after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We present initial spectroscopic characterizations of 3I using observations from the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph on the 4.1 m SOAR Telescope in Chile during the night of July 3rd. The reflectance spectrum of 3I, covering 3700-7000{\AA} reveals a red continuum, comparable to extreme trans-Neptunian objects, with a weak UV-optical turnover indicative of complex carbonaceous and irradiated organics. At the time of observation, when 3I was at a heliocentric distance of 4.4 AU, we detected no discernible gas emission from canonical cometary species (CN, C$_3$, C$_2$, CO$^+$, [OI]). This is in agreement with expectations from our thermal-evolution model, which indicates sublimation-driven activity should commence once 3I/ATLAS approaches smaller heliocentric distances. Nonetheless, the paradoxical situation of early onset coma without evidence of sublimation tracers calls for other dust-liberating mechanisms that ancient ISOs may be subjected to at large heliocentric distances.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 6 sqrt(a) kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 &lt; a &lt; 100, we infer dM/dt = 6 to 60 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r &lt; 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.16 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.</description>

      <title>Synthesizer: a Software Package for Synthetic Astronomical Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables. The code is publicly available at https://synthesizer-project.github.io/</description>
