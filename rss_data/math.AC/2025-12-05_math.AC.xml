      <title>Torsion and complete dualizable objects in tensor-triangulated categories over a Noetherian ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study categories of dualizable torsion and complete objects for compactly-rigidly generated tensor-triangulated categories T with a Noetherian central action of a graded commutative Noetherian ring R. We show that they always admit a natural Noetherian action of the completed graded ring R^ and that the categories of dualizable torsion and complete objects can be abstractly reconstructed as tensor-triangulated R^-linear categories from the category of compact torsions objects with the corresponding structure. If the category of compact objects of T in addition admits a strong generator g, we show that the torsion coreflection (resp. complete reflection) of g is a strong generator for the category of dualizable torsion (resp. dualizable complete) objects. In that case, we also show that the categories of dualizable torsion and compact torsion objects determine each other in terms of Brown-type representability theorems.</description>

      <title>When is the relative Frobenius an isomorphism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A field extension $L/K$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ is formally \'etale if and only if the relative Frobenius of $L/K$ is an isomorphism. Inspired by this classical result, we explore whether the formally \'etale property for a map $R \to S$ of $\mathbf{F}_p$-algebras is characterized by isomorphism of the relative Frobenius $F_{S/R}$. While $F_{S/R}$ being an isomorphism implies $R \to S$ is formally \'etale, the converse fails in the non-Noetherian setting. Thus, following Morrow, we introduce an enhancement of the formally \'etale property that we call b-nil (bounded nil) formally \'etale, and we show that $F_{S/R}$ is an isomorphism precisely when $R \to S$ is b-nil formally \'etale. The b-nil formally \'etale property is quite different from the formally \'etale property. For instance, we show that any b-nil formally \'etale algebra over an $F$-pure ring is reduced, whereas non-reduced formally \'etale algebras exist over $\mathbf{F}_p$ by a construction of Bhatt. We also show that the b-nil formally \'etale property neither implies nor is implied by having a trivial cotangent complex. We explore when formally \'etale implies b-nil formally \'etale in prime characteristic. The known cases mainly arise from the fact that a weakly \'etale map has isomorphic relative Frobenius. We record two additional cases that may be of interest. The first is for a map $R \to S$ of $F$-finite rings such that $S$ has finitely presented absolute Frobenius. Secondly, we show that any formally \'etale map of Noetherian rings of prime characteristic is b-nil formally \'etale.</description>

      <title>Cobham's theorem for the Gaussian integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the four exponentials conjecture, Hansel and Safer showed that if a subset $S$ of the Gaussian integers is both $\alpha=-m+i $- and $\beta=-n+i$-recognizable, then it is syndetic, and they conjectured that $S$ must be eventually periodic. Without assuming the four exponentials conjecture, we show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers, and at least one of $\alpha$, $\beta$ is not an $n$-th root of an integer, then any $\alpha$- and $\beta$-automatic configuration is eventually periodic; in particular we prove Hansel and Safer's conjecture. Otherwise, there exist non-eventually periodic configurations which are $\alpha$-automatic for any root of an integer $\alpha$. Our work generalises the Cobham-Semenov theorem to Gaussian numerations.</description>

      <title>Switching Rook Polynomials of Collections of Cells: Palindromicity and Domino-Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rook polynomial is a generating function that enumerates the number of ways to place rooks, with no two in the same row or column, on a collection of cells regarded as a pruned chessboard. In combinatorial commutative algebra, special attention is devoted to its variant, the switching rook polynomial, which is conjectured to coincide with the $h$-polynomial of the $K$-algebra associated with the given collection of cells. In this context, palindromicity plays a crucial role, as it reflects the algebraic property of Gorensteinness. In this paper, we introduce a new combinatorial property, called domino-stability, and we prove that the switching rook polynomial of a collection of cells $\mathcal{P}$ is palindromic if and only if $\mathcal{P}$ is domino-stable. Building upon this result, we derive new insights into the characterization of Gorenstein $K$-algebras arising from polyominoes or, more generally, from collections of cells.</description>
