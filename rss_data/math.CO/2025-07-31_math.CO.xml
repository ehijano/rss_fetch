      <title>A Cop-Win Graph with Maximum Capture Time $\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of cops and robbers is played on a fixed (finite or infinite) graph $G$. The cop chooses his starting position, then the robber chooses his. After that, they take turns and move to adjacent vertices, or stay at their current vertex, with the cop moving first. The game finishes if the cop lands on the robber's vertex. In that case we say that the cop wins, while if the robber is never caught then we say that the robber wins. The graph $G$ is called cop-win if the cop has a winning strategy.
  In this paper we construct an infinite cop-win graph in which, for any two given starting positions of the cop and the robber, we can name in advance a finite time in which the cop can capture the robber, but these finite times are not bounded above. This shows that this graph has maximum capture time (CR-ordinal) $\omega$, disproving a conjecture of Bonato, Gordinowicz and Hahn that no such graph should exist.</description>

      <title>An explicit power series result for the two type ASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in combinatorics has often focused on the ASEP (asymmetric simple exclusion process). The ASEP is inspired by processes in statistical mechanics, and involves particles of various species moving around a lattice. The particles do not change species. In the present paper, based on earlier results of Mortimer and Prellberg and others, we obtain a new power series results for the two type ASEP.</description>

      <title>Rook sums in the symmetric group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the group algebra $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ of the $n$-th symmetric group $S_n$ over a commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$. For any two subsets $A$ and $B$ of $[n]$, we define the elements \[ \nabla_{B,A}:=\sum_{\substack{w\in S_n;\\w\left( A\right) =B}} w \qquad \text{and} \qquad \widetilde{\nabla}_{B,A}:=\sum_{\substack{w\in S_n;\\w\left( A\right) \subseteq B}}w \] of $\mathcal{A}$. We study these elements, showing in particular that their minimal polynomials factor into linear factors (with integer coefficients). We express the product $\nabla_{D,C}\nabla_{B,A}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of $\nabla_{U,V}$'s.
  More generally, for any two set compositions (i.e., ordered set partitions) $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ of $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\right\} $, we define $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}\in\mathcal{A}$ to be the sum of all permutations $w\in S_n$ that send each block of $\mathbf{A}$ to the corresponding block of $\mathbf{B}$. This generalizes $\nabla_{B,A}$. The factorization property of minimal polynomials does not extend to the $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}$, but we describe the ideal spanned by the $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}$ and a further ideal complementary to it. These two ideals have a "mutually annihilative" relationship, are free as $\mathbf{k}$-modules, and appear as annihilators of tensor product $S_n$-representations; they are also closely related to Murphy's cellular bases, Specht modules, pattern-avoiding permutations and even some algebras appearing in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>An equality for balanced digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a directed multigraph $D$ that is balanced (i.e., at each vertex, the indegree equals the outdegree). Let $A$ be its set of arcs. Fix an integer $k$. Let $s$ be a vertex of $D$. We show that the number of $k$-element subsets $B$ of $A$ that contain no cycles but contain a path from each vertex to $s$ (we call them "$s$-convergences") is independent on $s$. This generalizes known facts about spanning arborescences, acyclic orientations and maximal acyclic subdigraphs (or, equivalently, minimum feedback arc sets).</description>

      <title>Structure of $k$-Matching-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of $k$-matching-planar graphs, which is a significant generalisation of many existing beyond planar graph classes, including $k$-planar graphs. For $k \geqslant 0$, a simple topological graph $G$ (that is, a graph drawn in the plane such that every pair of edges intersect at most once, including endpoints) is $k$-matching-planar if for every edge $e \in E(G)$, every matching amongst the edges of $G$ that cross $e$ has size at most $k$. We prove that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph is isomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This result qualitatively extends the planar graph product structure theorem of Dujmovi\'c, Joret, Micek, Morin, Ueckerdt, and Wood [J. ACM 2020] and recent product structure theorems for other beyond planar graph classes. Using this result, we deduce that the class of simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs has several attractive properties, making it the broadest class of simple beyond planar graphs in the literature that has these properties. All of our results about simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs generalise to the non-simple setting, where the maximum number of pairwise crossing edges incident to a common vertex becomes relevant.
  The paper introduces several tools and results of independent interest. We show that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph admits an edge-colouring with $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}\log k)$ colours such that monochromatic edges do not cross. As a key ingredient of the proof of our main product structure theorem, we introduce the concept of weak shallow minors, which subsume and generalise shallow minors, a key concept in graph sparsity theory. We also establish upper bounds on the treewidth of graphs with well-behaved circular drawings that qualitatively generalise several existing results.</description>

      <title>Is the space of reachable particle configurations dense?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p_0,\ldots,p_n$ be a finite sequence of points in an Euclidean space $\R^d$. Suppose that there is a (pointlike) particle sitting at each point $p_i$. In a ``legal'' move, any one of them can jump over another, landing on the other side, at exactly the same distance. Under what circumstances can we guarantee that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any other sequence of points $q_0,\ldots, q_n\in\R^d$, there is a finite sequence of legal moves that takes the particle at $p_i$ to the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of $q_i$, simultaneously for every $i$?
  We prove that this is possible if and only if the additive group generated by the vectors $p_1-p_0,\ldots,p_n-p_0$ is dense in $\R^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez proved that graphs of bounded degeneracy that have a path of order $n$ also have an induced path of order $\Omega(\log \log n)$. In this paper we give an almost matching upper bound by describing, for arbitrarily large values of $n$, a 2-degenerate graph that has a path of order $n$ and where all induced paths have order $O(\log \log n \cdot \log \log \log n)$.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius of simplicial complexes without holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tur\'an problem for hypergraphs and its spectral version is a central and challenging topic in extremal combinatorics. In this paper, we view hypergraphs from the perspective of simplicial complexes, and investigate the spectral version of Tur\'an problem for simplicial complexes. We characterize the simplicial complex that maximizes the signless Laplacian spectral radius among all hole-free simplicial complexes, and establish an upper bound on the spectral radius for simplicial complexes with a prescribed Betti number. As an application, we derive bounds on Tur\'an numbers for both hypergraphs and simplicial complexes via the connection between the spectral radius and the face numbers.</description>

      <title>Maker playing against an invisible Breaker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the phantom version of Maker-Breaker positional games. In a phantom game, the moves of one of the players are hidden from the other player, who still has the complete information. We look at the biased $(a:b)$ Maker-PhantomBreaker games where the board is the edge set of the complete graph on $n$ vertices, $K_n$, and Maker has no information about PhantomBreaker's choices of edges. We give randomized strategies for both players in four classical games: connectivity game, perfect matching game, mindegree-$k$ game and Hamiltonicity game. In particular, we focus on characterizing all biases $(a:b)$ for which Maker wins asymptotically almost surely.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Schur polynomials have saturated Newton polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every supersymmetric Schur polynomial has a saturated Newton polytope (SNP). Our approach begins with a tableau-theoretic description of the suport, which we encode as a polyhedron with a totally unimodular constraint matrix. The integrality of this polyhedron follows from the Hoffman-Kruskal criterion, thereby establishing the SNP property. To our knowledge, this is the first application of total unimodularity to the SNP problem.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for computing the partition function of the Potts model for SP-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The q-state Potts model is a fundamental framework in statistical physics and graph theory, with its partition function encoding rich information about spin configurations. The multivariate Tutte polynomial (known as the partition function of the Potts model) can be defined on an arbitrary finite graph $G$ and encodes a lot of important combinatorial information about the graph. As a special case, it contains the familiar Tutte polynomial with two variables and, consequently, its specialization with one variable, such as the chromatic polynomial, the flow polynomial and the reliability polynomial. The main goal of this paper is to present an efficient algorithm for computing the Potts model partition function on SP-graphs (series-parallel graphs) with arbitrary weights. The algorithm for SP-graphs is based on simplifying the graph by replacing several edges with a single edge of equivalent weight, which significantly reduces computational complexity. In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm for exactly computing the Potts model partition function on series-parallel graphs (SP-graphs).</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian paths in iterated line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integer $n$, the $n$-iterated line graph $L^n(G)$ of an undirected graph $G$ is defined to be $L(L^{n-1}(G))$, where $L^1(G)$ is the line graph $L(G)$ of $G$. In this paper we introduce hamiltonian path index. Hamiltonian path index, denoted by $h_p(G)$, is the minimum number $n$ such that $L^n(G)$ contains a hamiltonian path. We show that hamiltonian path index of $G$ exists for any graph $G$ and we set the exact value of hamiltonian path index for trees and discuss the problem about graphs with hamiltonian 2-connected blocks.</description>

      <title>Domino tilings beyond 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a rich history of domino tilings in two dimensions. Through a variety of techniques we can answer questions such as: how many tilings are there of a given region or what does the space of all tilings look like? These questions and their answers become significantly more difficult in dimension three and above. Despite this curse of dimensionality, there have been exciting recent advances in the theory. Here we briefly review foundational results of two-dimensional domino tilings and highlight where challenges arise when generalizing to higher dimensions. We then survey results in higher dimensional domino tilings, focusing on the question of connectivity of the space of tilings, and the open problems that still remain.</description>

      <title>Proof of the linkage conjecture for highly connected tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph $D$ is $k$-linked if for every $2k$ distinct vertices $ x_1,\ldots , x_k, y_1, \ldots , y_k$ in $D$, there exist $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint paths $P_1,\ldots, P_k$ such that $P_i$ starts at $x_i$ and ends at $y_i$ for each $i\in [k]$. In 2021, Gir\~{a}o, Popielarz, and Snyder [Combinatorica 41 (2021) 815--837] conjectured that there exists a constant $C &gt;0$ such that every $(2k+1)$-connected tournament with minimum out-degree at least $Ck$ is $k$-linked. In this paper, we disprove this conjecture by constructing a family of counterexamples with minimum out-degree at least $\frac{k^2+11k}{26}$ (for $k\geq 42$). Further, we prove that every $(2k+1)$-connected semicomplete digraph $D$ with minimum out-degree at least $ 7k^2 + 36k$ is $k$-linked. This result is optimal in terms of both connectivity and minimum out-degree (up to a multiplicative factor), which refines and generalizes the earlier result of Gir\~{a}o, Popielarz, and Snyder.</description>

      <title>Catalan number sequences and generalized action graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action graphs emerged from work of Bergner and Hackney on category actions in the context of Reedy categories. Alvarez, Bergner, and Lopez showed that action graphs could be inductively generated without reference to category actions and have a close relationship with the sequence of Catalan numbers. These graphs were further generalized in work of Cressman, Lin, Nguyen, and Wiljanen, who showed that the Fuss-Catalan numbers have a similar relation to another set of inductively defined directed graphs. In our paper, we consider several other sequences related to the Catalan numbers, namely Catalan's triangle, $(a,b)$-Catalan numbers, internal triangles, and super Catalan numbers. We show action graphs cannot be generalized to Catalan's triangle, $(a,b)$-Catalan numbers, nor internal triangles. We also conjecture a method for constructing action graphs for the Super Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Hamilton cycles in pseudorandom graphs: resilience and approximate decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac's classical theorem asserts that, for $n \ge 3$, any $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $n/2$ is Hamiltonian. Furthermore, if we additionally assume that such graphs are regular, then, by the breakthrough work of Csaba, K\"uhn, Lo, Osthus and Treglown, they admit a decomposition into Hamilton cycles and at most one perfect matching, solving the well-known Nash-Williams conjecture. In the pseudorandom setting, it has long been conjectured that similar results hold in much sparser graphs. We prove two overarching theorems for graphs that exclude excessively dense subgraphs, which yield asymptotically optimal resilience and Hamilton-decomposition results in sparse pseudorandom graphs. In particular, our results imply that for every fixed $\gamma &gt; 0$, there exists a constant $C &gt; 0$ such that if $G$ is a spanning subgraph of an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph satisfying $\delta(G) \ge (\tfrac12 + \gamma)d$ and $d/\lambda \ge C$, then $G$ must contain a Hamilton cycle. Secondly, we show that for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is $C &gt; 0$ so that every $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph with $d/\lambda \ge C$ contains at least $(\tfrac12 - \varepsilon)d$ edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles, and, finally, we prove that the entire edge set of $G$ can be covered by no more than $(\tfrac12 + \varepsilon)d$ such cycles. All bounds are asymptotically optimal and significantly improve earlier results on Hamiltonian resilience, packing, and covering in sparse pseudorandom graphs.</description>

      <title>On a Ramsey--Tur\'{a}n variant of Roth's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Roth states that the maximum size of a solution-free set of a homogeneous linear equation $\mathcal{L}$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ is $o(p)$ if and only if the sum of the coefficients of $\mathcal{L}$ is $0$. In this paper, we prove a Ramsey--Tur\'{a}n variant of Roth's theorem, with respect to a natural notion of ``structured'' sets introduced by Erd\H{o}s and S\'ark\"ozy in the 1970's. Namely, we show that the following statements are equivalent:
  $(a)$ Every solution-free set $A$ of $\mathcal{L}$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ with $\alpha(\mathrm{Cay}_{\mathbb{F}_p}(A)) = o(p)$ has size $o(p)$.
  $(b)$ There exists a non-empty \emph{subset} of coefficients of $\mathcal{L}$ with zero sum.</description>

      <title>Conditions for building generalized action graphs from sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the properties of directed graphs, termed generalized action graphs, which exhibit a strong connection to certain number sequences. Focusing on the structural and combinatorial aspects, we investigate the conditions under which specific sequences can generate generalized action graphs. Building upon prior research in this field, we analyze specific features of these graphs and how they correspond to patterns and properties in their sequences. These findings support a broader conclusion that establishes framework for identifying which sequences can produce generalized action graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of a Bienayme-Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have a large number of vertices and either a fixed number of leaves or a fixed number of internal nodes. The first biconditioning gives a universal result with respect to the offspring distribution. In contrast, the second case leads to a variety of limiting behaviors, ranging from condensation phenomena to more elongated tree structures, depending on the properties of the offspring distribution. To prove these results, we use tools from conditioned random walk theory and from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chaining multiplicative-inverse operations in finite fields under alternating polynomial bases. When using two distinct polynomial bases to alternate the inverse operation we obtain a partition of $\mathbb F_{p^n}\setminus \mathbb F_p$ into disjoint cycles of even length. This allows a natural interpretation of the cycles as permutation cycles. Finally, we explore chaining under more than two polynomial bases.</description>

      <title>Canonical colourings in random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R\"odl and Ruci\'nski (1990) established Ramsey's theorem for random graphs. In particular, for fixed integers $r$, $\ell\geq 2$ they showed that $\hat p_{K_\ell,r}(n)=n^{-\frac{2}{\ell+1}}$ is a threshold for the Ramsey property that every $r$-colouring of the edges of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ yields a monochromatic copy of $K_\ell$. We investigate how this result extends to arbitrary colourings of $G(n,p)$ with an unbounded number of colours. In this situation, Erd\H{o}s and Rado showed that canonically coloured copies of $K_\ell$ can be ensured in the deterministic setting. We transfer the Erd\H{o}s-Rado theorem to the random environment and show that both thresholds coincide for $\ell\geq 4$. As a consequence, the proof yields $K_{\ell+1}$-free graphs $G$ for which every edge colouring contains a canonically coloured $K_\ell$.
  The $0$-statement of the threshold is a direct consequence of the corresponding statement of the R\"odl-Ruci\'nski theorem and the main contribution is the $1$-statement. The proof of the $1$-statement employs the transference principle of Conlon and Gowers.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate polynomial generalizations of the van der Waerden theorem with a focus on largeness properties of recurrence patterns. We prove an $IP_r^\star$-strengthened version of the polynomial van der Waerden theorem, where the recurrence set is guaranteed to be large in a precise combinatorial sense. As applications, we obtain new monochromatic polynomial configurations in both additive and multiplicative settings, including refined results over sum subsystems of IP-sets. Additionally, we prove exponential monochromatic patterns are abundant.</description>

      <title>Trail Trap: a variant of Partizan Edge Geography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-player game played on undirected graphs called {\sc Trail Trap}, which is a variant of a game known as {\sc Partizan Edge Geography}. One player starts by choosing any edge and moving a token from one endpoint to the other; the other player then chooses a different edge and does the same. Alternating turns, each player moves their token along an unused edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex, until one player cannot move and loses. We present an algorithm to determine which player has a winning strategy when the graph is a tree and partially characterize the trees on which a given player wins. Additionally, we show that it is NP-hard to determine if Player~2 has a winning strategy on {\sc Trail Trap} from the starting position, even for connected bipartite planar graphs with maximum degree $4$. We determine which player has a winning strategy for certain subclasses of complete bipartite graphs and grid graphs, and we propose several open problems for further study.</description>

Abstract: Eulerian polynomials record the distribution of descents over permutations. Caylerian polynomials likewise record the distribution of descents over Cayley permutations, where a Cayley permutation is a word of positive integers such that if a number appears in the word then all positive integers less than that number also appear in the word. Using combinatorial species and sign-reversing involutions we derive counting formulas and generating functions for the Caylerian polynomials as well as for related refined polynomials.</description>

      <title>On $(k,g)$-Graphs without $(g+1)$-Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graph is a $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ which does not contain cycles of length $g+1$. Such graphs are known to exist for all parameter pairs $k \geq 3, g \geq 3 $, and we focus on determining the orders $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ of the smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs. This problem can be viewed as a special case of the previously studied Girth Pair Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph in which the length of a smallest even length cycle and the length of a smallest odd length cycle are prescribed. When considering the case of an odd girth $g$, this problem also yields results towards the Cage Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$. We establish the monotonicity of the function $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ with respect to increasing $g$, and present universal lower bounds for the values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$. We propose an algorithm for generating all $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs on $n$ vertices, use this algorithm to determine several of the smaller values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$, and discuss various approaches to finding smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs within several classes of highly symmetrical graphs.</description>

      <title>On the existence and non-existence of spherical $m$-stiff configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of $m$-stiff configurations in the unit sphere $S^{d-1}$, which are spherical $(2m-1)$-designs that lie on $m$ parallel hyperplanes. We establish two non-existence results: (1) for each fixed integer $m &gt; 5$, there exists no $m$-stiff configuration in $S^{d-1}$ for sufficiently large $d$; (2) for each fixed integer $d &gt; 10$, there exists no $m$-stiff configuration in $S^{d-1}$ for sufficiently large $m$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the dimensions where $m$-stiff configurations exist for $m=2,3,4,5$. We also determine the non-existence (and the existence) of $m$-stiff configurations in $S^{d-1}$ for small $d$ ($3 \leq d \leq 120$) with arbitrary $m$, and also for small $m$ ($6 \leq m \leq 10$) with arbitrary $d$. Finally, we conjecture that there is no $m$-stiff configuration in $S^{d-1}$ for $(d,m)$ with $d\geq 3$ and $m\geq 6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any two sequences of complex numbers, we establish simple relations between their binomial convolution and the binomial convolution of their individual binomial transforms. We employ these relations to derive new identities involving Fibonacci numbers, Bernoulli numbers, Catalan numbers, harmonic numbers, odd harmonic numbers, and binomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Generalizing blocking semiovals in finite projective planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blocking semiovals and the determination of their (minimum) sizes constitute one of the central research topics in finite projective geometry. In this article we introduce the concept of blocking set with the $r_\infty$-property in a finite projective plane $\text{PG}(2,q)$, with $r_\infty$ a line of $\text{PG}(2,q)$ and $q$ a prime power. This notion greatly generalizes that of blocking semioval. We address the question of determining those integers $k$ for which there exists a blocking set of size $k$ with the $r_\infty$-property. To solve this problem, we build new theory which deeply analyzes the interplay between blocking sets in finite projective and affine planes.</description>

      <title>A simple layered-wheel-like construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in characterizing the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth and pathwidth. While this has recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open, and prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like obstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each branching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete subgraphs.
  There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather involved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our construction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be arbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and (c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has treewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several previously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most one satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c) simultaneously.
  In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that every graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must contain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction provides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to have arbitrarily large girth.</description>

      <title>Type R $\lambda$-Permutation Approach to Velleman's Open Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously, mathematicians Steven Krantz and Jeffery McNeal studied a type of positive numbers permutation called $\lambda$-permutation. This type of permutation, when applied to the index of terms of a series, is defined to be both convergence-preserving and "fixing" at least one divergent series, that is, rearranging the terms of any convergent series will result in a convergent series, while rearranging the terms of some divergent series will result in a convergent series. In general, if a divergent series can be fixed to converge in some way (it does not need to be by $\lambda$-permutation), it is called a "conditionally divergent series". In 2006, another mathematician Daniel Velleman raised an open problem related to $\lambda$-permutation: for a conditionally divergent series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n,n\in \mathbb{N},a_n\in \mathbb{R}$, let $S=\{L \in \mathbb{R} \colon L = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{a_{\sigma\left(n\right)}}$ $\text{for some } \lambda\text{-permutation } \sigma\}$, can $S$ ever be something between $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}$? This paper is devoted to partially answering this open problem by considering a subset of $\lambda$-permutation constraint by how we can permute, named type R $\lambda$-permutation. Then we answer the analogous question about a subset of S with respect to type R $\lambda$-permutation, named $Z_{R}=\{L \in \mathbb{R} \colon L = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{a_{\sigma\left(n\right)}}$ $\text{for some type R } \lambda \text{-permutation } \sigma\}$. We show that $Z_R$ is either $\emptyset$, a singleton or $\mathbb{R}$. We also provide sufficient conditions on the conditionally divergent series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n$ for $Z_R$ to be a singleton or $\mathbb{R}$, by introducing a "substantial property" on the series.</description>

      <title>A new width parameter of graphs based on edge cuts: $\alpha$-edge-crossing width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce graph width parameters, called $\alpha$-edge-crossing width and edge-crossing width. These are defined in terms of the number of edges crossing a bag of a tree-cut decomposition. They are motivated by edge-cut width, recently introduced by Brand et al. (WG 2022). We show that edge-crossing width is equivalent to the known parameter tree-partition-width. On the other hand, $\alpha$-edge-crossing width is a new parameter; tree-cut width and $\alpha$-edge-crossing width are incomparable, and they both lie between tree-partition-width and edge-cut width.
  We provide an algorithm that, for a given $n$-vertex graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $\alpha$, in time $2^{O((\alpha+k)\log (\alpha+k))}n^2$ either outputs a tree-cut decomposition certifying that the $\alpha$-edge-crossing width of $G$ is at most $2\alpha^2+5k$ or confirms that the $\alpha$-edge-crossing width of $G$ is more than $k$. As applications, for every fixed $\alpha$, we obtain FPT algorithms for the List Coloring and Precoloring Extension problems parameterized by $\alpha$-edge-crossing width. They were known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by tree-partition-width, and FPT parameterized by edge-cut width, and we close the complexity gap between these two parameters.</description>

      <title>Spectral measure for uniform $d$-regular digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the matrix $A_{\mathcal{G}}$ chosen uniformly at random from the finite set of all $N$-dimensional matrices of zero main-diagonal and binary entries, having each row and column of $A_{\mathcal{G}}$ sum to $d$. That is, the adjacency matrix for the uniformly random $d$-regular simple digraph $\mathcal{G}$. Fixing $d \ge 3$, it has long been conjectured that as $N \to \infty$ the corresponding empirical eigenvalue distributions converge weakly, in probability, to an explicit non-random limit, %measure $\mu_d$ on $\mathbb{C}$, which is given by the Brown measure of the free sum of $d$ Haar unitary operators. We reduce this conjecture to bounding the decay in $N$ of the probability that the minimal singular value of the shifted matrix $A(w) = A_{\mathcal{G}} - w I$ is very small. While the latter remains a challenging task, the required bound is comparable to the recently established control on the singularity of $A_{\mathcal{G}}$. The reduction is achieved here by sharp estimates on the behavior at large $N$, near the real line, of the Green's function (aka resolvent) of the Hermitization of $A(w)$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a Orlik-Solomon type presentation for the cohomology ring of arrangements in a non-compact abelian Lie group. The new insight consists in comparing arrangements in different abelian groups. Our work is based on the Varchenko-Gelfand ring for real hyperplane arrangements and from that we deduce the cohomology rings of all other abelian arrangements. As by-product, we obtain a new proof of the Orlik-Solomon relations and De Concini-Procesi ones.</description>

      <title>General limit theorems for mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mixtures of free, monotone, and Boolean independence described by a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ in the context of $\mathcal{T}$-free convolutions of Jekel and Liu. We prove general limit theorems for the associated additive convolution operations $\boxplus_G$. For a sequence of digraphs $G_n = (V_n,E_n)$, we give sufficient conditions for the limit $\widehat{\mu} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \boxplus_{G_n}(\mu_n)$ to exist whenever the Boolean convolution powers $\mu_n^{\uplus |V_n|}$ converge to some $\mu$. This in particular includes central limit and Poisson limit theorems, as well as limit theorems for each classical domain of attraction. The hypothesis on the sequence of $G_n$ is that the normalized counts of digraph homomorphisms from rooted trees into $G_n$ converge as $n \to \infty$, and we verify this for several families of examples where the $G_n$'s converge in some sense to a continuum limit, or digraphon. In particular, we obtain a new limit theorem for multiregular digraphs, as well as recovering several limit theorems in prior work.</description>

      <title>Metaconcepts of rooted tree balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measures of tree balance play an important role in many different research areas such as mathematical phylogenetics or theoretical computer science. Typically, tree balance is quantified by a single number which is assigned to the tree by a balance or imbalance index, of which several exist in the literature. Most of these indices are based on structural aspects of tree shape, such as clade sizes or leaf depths. For instance, indices like the Sackin index, total cophenetic index, and $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic all quantify tree balance through clade sizes, albeit with different definitions and properties.
  In this paper, we formalize the idea that many tree (im)balance indices are functions of similar underlying tree shape characteristics by introducing metaconcepts of tree balance. A metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on a function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape, such as balance values, clade sizes, or leaf depths. These metaconcepts encompass existing indices but also provide new means of measuring tree balance. The versatility and generality of metaconcepts allow for the systematic study of entire families of (im)balance indices, providing deeper insights that extend beyond index-by-index analysis.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequalities and universal approximators for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Poincar\'e inequalities are indispensable tools in the study of dimension reduction and low-distortion embeddings of graphs into metric spaces, and have found remarkable algorithmic applications. A basic open problem, posed by Jon Kleinberg (2013), asks whether the optimal nonlinear Poincar\'e constant for maps between two independent $3$-regular random graphs is dimension-free, i.e., independent of vertex-set sizes. We give a complete and affirmative resolution to Kleinberg's problem, also allowing for arbitrary graph degrees. As a corollary, we obtain a stochastic construction of $O(1)\text{-universal}$ approximators for random graphs, answering a question of Mendel and Naor.</description>

Abstract: We study the class of squarefree principal vector-spread Borel ideals. We compute the minimal primary decomposition of these ideals and thereby we prove that they are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. As the final conclusion of our results, we completely classify the ideals in our class having the property that their ordinary and symbolic powers coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</description>
