      <title>Sample Path Large Deviations for Multivariate Heavy-Tailed Hawkes Processes and Related L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop sample path large deviations for multivariate Hawkes processes with heavy-tailed mutual excitation rates. Our techniques rely on multivariate hidden regular variation, in conjunction with the cluster representation of Hawkes processes and a recent result on the tail asymptotics of the cluster sizes, to unravel the most likely configuration of (multiple) big jumps. Our proof hinges on establishing asymptotic equivalence between a suitably scaled multivariate Hawkes process and a coupled L\'evy process with multivariate hidden regular variation. Hence, along the way, we derive a sample-path large deviations principle for a class of multivariate heavy-tailed L\'evy processes that plays an auxiliary role in our analysis but is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Phase Synchronization in Random Geometric Graphs on the 2D Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is a classical nonlinear ODE system designed to study synchronization phenomena. Each equation represents the phase of an oscillator and the coupling between them is determined by a graph. There is an increasing interest in understanding the relation between the graph topology and the spontaneous synchronization of the oscillators. Abdalla, Bandeira and Invernizzi considered random geometric graphs on the $d$-dimensional sphere and proved that the system synchronizes with high probability as long as the mean number of neighbors and the dimension $d$ go to infinity. They posed the question about the behavior when $d$ is small. In this paper, we prove that synchronization holds for random geometric graphs on the two-dimensional sphere, with high probability as the number of nodes goes to infinity, as long as the initial conditions converge to a smooth function.</description>

      <title>Formal Approximations of the Transient Distributions of the M/G/1 Workload Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper calculates transient distributions of a special class of Markov processes with continuous state space and in continuous time, up to an explicit error bound. We approximate specific queues on R with one-sided L\'evy input, such as the M/G/1 workload process, with a finite-state Markov chain. The transient distribution of the original process is approximated by a distribution with a density which is piecewise constant on the state space. Easy-to-calculate error bounds for the difference between the approximated and actual transient distributions are provided in the Wasserstein distance. Our method is fast: to achieve a practically useful error bound, it usually requires only a few seconds or at most minutes of computation time.</description>

      <title>On the performance of the Euler-Maruyama scheme for multidimensional SDEs with discontinuous drift coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strong approximation of $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a discontinuous drift coefficient. More precisely, we essentially assume that the drift coefficient is piecewise Lipschitz continuous with an exceptional set $\Theta\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ that is an orientable $C^4$-hypersurface of positive reach, the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be Lipschitz continuous and, in a neighborhood of $\Theta$, both coefficients are bounded and the diffusion coefficient has a non-degenerate portion orthogonal to $\Theta$.
  In recent years, a number of results have been proven in the literature for strong approximation of such SDEs and, in particular, the performance of the Euler-Maruyama scheme was studied. For $d=1$ and finite $\Theta$ it was shown that the Euler-Maruyama scheme achieves an $L_p$-error rate of at least $1/2$ for all $p\geq 1$ as in the classical case of Lipschitz continuous coefficients. For $d&gt;1$, it was only known so far, that the Euler-Maruyama scheme achieves an $L_2$-error rate of at least $1/4-$ if, additionally, the coefficients $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are globally bounded.
  In this article, we prove that in the above setting the Euler-Maruyama scheme in fact achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of at least $1/2-$ for all $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and all $p\geq 1$. The proof of this result is based on the well-known approach of transforming such an SDE into an SDE with globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, a new It\^{o} formula for a class of functions which are not globally $C^2$ and a detailed analysis of the expected total time that the actual position of the time-continuous Euler-Maruyama scheme and its position at the preceding time point on the underlying grid are on 'different sides' of the hypersurface $\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Recovering Small Communities in the Planted Partition Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze community recovery in the planted partition model (PPM) in regimes where the number of communities is arbitrarily large. We examine the three standard recovery regimes: exact recovery, almost exact recovery, and weak recovery. When communities vary in size, traditional accuracy- or alignment-based metrics become unsuitable for assessing the correctness of a predicted partition. To address this, we redefine these recovery regimes using the correlation coefficient, a more versatile metric for comparing partitions. We then demonstrate that \emph{Diamond Percolation}, an algorithm based on common-neighbors, successfully recovers communities under mild assumptions on edge probabilities, with minimal restrictions on the number and sizes of communities. As a key application, we consider the case where community sizes follow a power-law distribution, a characteristic frequently found in real-world networks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first recovery results for such unbalanced partitions.</description>

      <title>Computable Bounds on the Solution to Poisson's Equation for General Harris Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson's equation is fundamental to the study of Markov chains, and arises in connection with martingale representations and central limit theorems for additive functionals, perturbation theory for stationary distributions, and average reward Markov decision process problems. In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic representation for the solution of Poisson's equation, and use Lyapunov functions to bound this solution representation explicitly. In contrast to most prior work on this problem, our bounds are computable. Our contribution is closely connected to recent work of Herve and Ledoux (2025), in which they focus their study on a special class of Harris chains satisfying a particular small set condition. However, our theory covers general Harris chains, and often provides a tighter bound. In addition to the new bound and representation, we also develop a computable uniform bound on marginal expectations for Harris chains, and a computable bound on the potential kernel representation of the solution to Poisson's equation.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of distributions through $\delta$-records and martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given parameters $c&gt;0, \delta\ne0$ and a sequence $(X_n)$ of real-valued, integrable, independent and identically $F$-distributed random variables, we characterise distributions $F$ such that $(N_n-cM_n)$ is a martingale, where $N_n$ denotes the number of observations $X_k$ among $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ such that $X_k&gt;M_{k-1}+\delta$, called $\delta$-records, and $M_k=\max\{X_1,\ldots, X_k\}$.
  The problem is recast as $1-F(x+\delta)=c\int_{x}^{\infty}(1-F)(t)dt$, for $x\in T$, with $F(T)=1$. Unlike standard functional equations, where the equality must hold for all $x$ in a fixed set, our problem involves a domain that depends on $F$ itself, introducing complexity but allowing for more possibilities of solutions.
  We find the explicit expressions of all solutions when $\delta &lt; 0$ and, when $\delta &gt; 0$, for distributions with bounded support. In the unbounded support case, we focus attention on continuous and lattice distributions. In the continuous setting, with support $\mathbb{R}_+$, we reduce the problem to a delay differential equation, showing that, besides particular cases of the exponential distribution, mixtures of exponential and gamma distributions and many others are solutions as well. The lattice case, with support $\mathbb{Z}_+$ is treated analogously and reduced to the study of a difference equation. Analogous results are obtained; in particular, mixtures of geometric and negative binomial distributions are found to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Denoising guarantees for optimized sampling schemes in compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing with subsampled unitary matrices benefits from \emph{optimized} sampling schemes, which feature improved theoretical guarantees and empirical performance relative to uniform subsampling. We provide, in a first of its kind in compressed sensing, theoretical guarantees showing that the error caused by the measurement noise vanishes with an increasing number of measurements for optimized sampling schemes, assuming that the noise is Gaussian. We moreover provide similar guarantees for measurements sampled with-replacement with arbitrary probability weights. All our results hold on prior sets contained in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate that this denoising behavior appears in empirical experiments with a rate that closely matches our theoretical guarantees when the prior set is the range of a generative ReLU neural network and when it is the set of sparse vectors.</description>

      <title>Analyzing homogenous and heterogeneous multi-server queues via neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a machine learning approach to predict the stationary distributions of the number of customers in a single-staiton multi server system. We consider two systems, the first is $c$ homogeneous servers, namely the $GI/GI/c$ queue. The second is a two-heterogeneous server system, namely the $GI/GI_i/2$ queue. We train a neural network for these queueing models, using the first four inter-arrival and service time moments. We demonstrate empirically that using the fifth moment and beyond does not increase accuracy.
  Compared to existing methods, we show that in terms of the stationary distribution and the mean value of the number of customers in a $GI/GI/c$ queue, we are state-of-the-art. Further, we are the only ones to predict the stationary distribution of the number of customers in the system in a $GI/GI_i/2$ queue. We conduct a thorough performance evaluation to assert that our model is accurate. In most cases, we demonstrate that our error is less than 5\%. Finally, we show that making inferences is very fast, where 5000 inferences can be made in parallel within a fraction of a second.</description>

      <title>Explainable post-training bias mitigation with distribution-based fairness metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel optimization framework with distribution-based fairness constraints for efficiently producing demographically blind, explainable models across a wide range of fairness levels. This is accomplished through post-processing, avoiding the need for retraining. Our framework, which is based on stochastic gradient descent, can be applied to a wide range of model types, with a particular emphasis on the post-processing of gradient-boosted decision trees. Additionally, we design a broad class of interpretable global bias metrics compatible with our method by building on previous work. We empirically test our methodology on a variety of datasets and compare it to other methods.</description>

      <title>On spectral gap decomposition for Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple works regarding convergence analysis of Markov chains have led to spectral gap decomposition formulas of the form \[ \mathrm{Gap}(S) \geq c_0 \left[\inf_z \mathrm{Gap}(Q_z)\right] \mathrm{Gap}(\bar{S}), \] where $c_0$ is a constant, $\mathrm{Gap}$ denotes the right spectral gap of a reversible Markov operator, $S$ is the Markov transition kernel (Mtk) of interest, $\bar{S}$ is an idealized or simplified version of $S$, and $\{Q_z\}$ is a collection of Mtks characterizing the differences between $S$ and $\bar{S}$.
  This type of relationship has been established in various contexts, including: 1. decomposition of Markov chains based on a finite cover of the state space, 2. hybrid Gibbs samplers, and 3. spectral independence and localization schemes.
  We show that multiple key decomposition results across these domains can be connected within a unified framework, rooted in a simple sandwich structure of $S$. Within the general framework, we establish new instances of spectral gap decomposition for hybrid hit-and-run samplers and hybrid data augmentation algorithms with two intractable conditional distributions. Additionally, we explore several other properties of the sandwich structure, and derive extensions of the spectral gap decomposition formula.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate probability measure with finite entropy on a countable group $G \leq \mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle acting proximally, minimally and topologically nonfreely on $S^1$. We prove that the circle $S^1$ endowed with its unique $\mu$-stationary probability measure is not the Poisson boundary of $(G,\mu)$. When $G$ is Thompson's group $T$ and $\mu$ is finitely supported, this answers a question posed by B. Deroin [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 2013] and A. Navas [Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, 2018].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove exponential tail bounds for canonical (or degenerate) $U$-statistics and $U$-processes under exponential-type tail assumptions on the kernels. Most of the existing results in the relevant literature often assume bounded kernels or obtain sub-optimal tail behavior under unbounded kernels. We obtain sharp rates and optimal tail behavior under sub-Weibull kernel functions. Some examples from nonparametric and semiparametric statistics literature are considered.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomial of generalized Ewens random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the convergence of the characteristic polynomial for random permutation matrices sampled from the generalized Ewens distribution. Under this distribution, the measure of a given permutation depends only on its cycle structure, according to certain weights assigned to each cycle length. The proof is based on uniform control of the characteristic polynomial using results from the singularity analysis of generating functions, together with the convergence of traces to explicit random variables expressed via a Poisson family. The limit function is the exponential of a Poisson series which has already appeared in the case of uniform permutation matrices. It is the Poisson analog of the Gaussian Holomorphic Chaos, related to the limit of characteristic polynomials for other matrix models such as Circular Ensembles, i.i.d. matrices, and Gaussian elliptic matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to propose a new approach to asymptotic analysis of the finite predictor for stationary sequences. It produces the exact asymptotics of the relative prediction error and the partial correlation coefficients. The assumptions are analytic in nature and applicable to processes with long range dependence. The ARIMA type process driven by the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), which previously remained elusive, serves as our study case.</description>

      <title>Tensor free probability theory: asymptotic tensor freeness and central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voiculescu's notion of asymptotic free independence applies to a wide range of random matrices, including those that are independent and unitarily invariant. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering random matrices with a tensor product structure that are invariant under the action of local unitary matrices. Assuming the existence of the \emph{tensor distribution} limit described by tuples of permutations, we show that an independent family of local unitary invariant random matrices satisfies asymptotically a novel form of freeness, which we term \emph{tensor freeness}. It can be defined via the vanishing of mixed \emph{tensor free cumulants}, allowing the joint tensor distribution of tensor free elements to be described in terms of that of individual elements. We present several applications of these results in the context of random matrices with a tensor product structure, such as partial transpositions of (local) unitarily invariant random matrices and tensor embeddings of random matrices. Furthermore, we propose a tensor free version of the central limit theorem, which extends and recovers several previous results for tensor products of free variables.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er--Rao Inequalities for Several Generalized Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Bruijn identity states that Fisher information is the half of the derivative of Shannon differential entropy along heat flow. In the same spirit, in this paper we introduce a generalized version of Fisher information, named as the R\'enyi--Fisher information, which is the half of the derivative of R\'enyi information along heat flow. Based on this R\'enyi--Fisher information, we establish sharp R\'enyi-entropic isoperimetric inequalities, which generalize the classic entropic isoperimetric inequality to the R\'enyi setting. Utilizing these isoperimetric inequalities, we extend the classical Cram\'er--Rao inequality from Fisher information to R\'enyi--Fisher information. Lastly, we use these generalized Cram\'er--Rao inequalities to determine the signs of derivatives of entropy along heat flow, strengthening existing results on the complete monotonicity of entropy.</description>

      <title>On the $W$-entropy and Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and its monotonicity for the heat flow on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces $(X, d, \mu)$, where $K\in \mathbb{R}$, $n$ is the geometric dimension of $(X, d, \mu)$ and $N\geq n$. We also prove the $K$-concavity of the Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ spaces. As an application, we derive the Shannon entropy isoperimetric inequality and the Stam logarithmic Sobolev inequality on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces with maximal volume growth condition. Finally, we prove the rigidity theorem for the Stam logarithmic Sobolev inequality with sharp constant on noncollapsing RCD$(0, N)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Coalescence in small generations for the diffusive randomly biased walk on Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06509v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the range $\mathcal{R}_T$ of the diffusive biased walk $\mathbb{X}$ on a Galton-Watson tree $\mathbb{T}$ in random environment, that is to say the sub-tree of $\mathbb{T}$ of all distinct vertices visited by this walk up to the time $T$. We study the volume of the range with constraints and more precisely the number of $k$-tuples ($k\geq 2$) of distinct vertices in this sub-tree, in small generations and satisfying an hereditary condition. A special attention is paid to the vertices visited during distinct excursions of $\mathbb{X}$ above the root of the Galton-Watson tree as we observe they give the major contribution to this range. As an application, we study the genealogy of $k\geq 2$ distinct vertices of the tree $\mathcal{R}_T$ picked uniformly from those in small generations. It turns out that two or more vertices among them share a common ancestor for the last time in the remote past. We also point out an hereditary character in their genealogical tree due to the random environment.</description>

      <title>Critical edge statistics for deformed GinUEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the complex Ginibre ensemble subjected to an additive perturbation by a deterministic normal matrix $X_0$, we establish that under specific spectral conditions on $X_0$, only two distinct types of local spectral statistics emerge at the spectral edge: GinUE statistics and critical statistics, which respectively correspond to regular and quadratically vanishing spectral points. The critical statistics, as a non-Hermitian analogue of Pearcey statistics in random matrix theory, describes a novel point process on the complex plane. This identifies the third (and likely final) universal statistics in non-Hermitian random matrix theory, after the established GinUE bulk and edge universality classes, and represents the primary achievement of this paper.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian maximal couplings and a vertical reflection principle on a class of sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an approach to constructing non-Markovian, non-co-adapted couplings for sub-Riemannian Brownian motions in sub-Riemannian manifolds with large symmetry groups by treating the specific cases of the three-dimensional Heisenberg group, higher-dimensional non-isotropic Heisenberg groups, SL(2,R) and its universal cover, and SU(2). Our primary focus is on the situation when the processes start from two points on the same vertical fiber, since in general Markovian or co-adapted couplings cannot give the sharp rate for the coupling time in this case. Non-Markovian couplings of this type on sub-Riemannian manifolds were first introduced by Banerjee-Gordina-Mariano, for the three-dimensional Heisenberg group, and were more recently extended by B\'en\'efice to SL(2,R) and SU(2), using a detailed consideration of the Brownian bridge. In contrast, our couplings are based on global isometries of the space, giving couplings that are maximal, as well as making the construction relatively simple and uniform across different manifolds. The coupled processes satisfy a reflection principle with respect to their coupling time, so that the coupling time reduces to the hitting time for one component of the Brownian motion, which is useful in explicitly bounding the tail probability of the coupling time. Further, it's natural to use this coupling as the second stage of a two-stage coupling when considering points on different vertical fibers. We estimate the coupling time in these various situations and give applications to inequalities for the heat semigroup.</description>

      <title>Bias and Division in the Free World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling bias is a foundational concept in statistics; associated bias transforms, such as size bias, have come to play important roles in probability theory of late. The first author and G. Reinert introduced zero bias, a transform whose unique fixed point is the normal distribution; it has become a standard tool in Stein's method and Gaussian approximation. Very recently, connections between zero bias and the class of infinitely divisible distributions have been found.
  In this paper, we develop a free probabilistic analog of the zero bias transform, proving its existence and regularity. The free zero bias has the semicircle law (free probability's central limit distribution) as its unique fixed point. We offer a construction of the free zero bias that mirrors a classical one incorporating square bias with a mollifier, and in the process develop a surprisingly new class of distributional operations through their Cauchy transforms.
  We then explore connections between the free zero bias, and size bias, with the class of freely infinitely divisible distributions. We develop a new self-contained treatment of the subject, together with a new characterization of free infinite divisibility using bias transforms. We also develop a parallel treatment of positively freely infinitely divisible distributions, which can also be characterized by a new kind of Levy--Khintchine formula that has no known classical analogue, and we use this to both give several new descriptions of such distributions and furnish new examples using these bias methods.</description>

      <title>Sharp Matrix Empirical Bernstein Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two sharp, closed-form empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <title>A unifying view on the irreversible investment exercise boundary in a stochastic, time-inhomogeneous capacity expansion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper devises a way to apply the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem to find the investment boundary of a rich stochastic, continuous time capacity expansion problem with irreversible investment on the finite time interval $[0, T]$, despite the presence of a state dependent scrap value associated with the production facility at the terminal time $T$. Standard variational methods are not feasible for the proposed singular stochastic control problem but it admits some first order conditions, complicated however by an extra, non integral term involving the scrap value function and depending on the initial capacity $y$, which are solved by devising a way to apply the Representation Theorem. Such devise, new and of interest in its own right, provides the existence of the base capacity $l^{\star}_y(t)$, a positive level which the optimal investment process is shown to become active at. As far as we know the Representation Theorem has never been applied to this extent. In the special case of deterministic coefficients, under a further assumption specific to the scrap value case, a unifying view on the curve at which it is optimal to invest emerges: the base capacity equals the investment boundary ${\hat y}(t)$ obtained by variational methods.</description>

      <title>Broker-Trader Partial Information Nash-Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study partial information Nash equilibrium between a broker and an informed trader. In this setting, the informed trader, who possesses knowledge of a trading signal, trades multiple assets with the broker in a dealer market. Simultaneously, the broker offloads these assets in a lit exchange where their actions impact the asset prices. The broker, however, only observes aggregate prices and cannot distinguish between underlying trends and volatility. Both the broker and the informed trader aim to maximize their penalized expected wealth. Using convex analysis, we characterize the Nash equilibrium and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness. Furthermore, we establish that this equilibrium corresponds to the solution of a nonstandard system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) that involves the two differing filtrations. For short enough time horizons, we prove that a unique solution of this system exists. Finally, under quite general assumptions, we show that the solution to the FBSDE system admits a polynomial approximation in the strength of the transient impact to arbitrary order, and prove that the error is controlled.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed.
  This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and Sinkhorn semigroups for log-concave models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15963v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we obtain several new results and developments in the study of entropic optimal transport problems (a.k.a. Schr\"odinger problems) with general reference distributions and log-concave target marginal measures. Our approach combines transportation cost inequalities
  with the theory of Riccati matrix difference equations arising in filtering and optimal control theory. This methodology is partly based on a novel entropic stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and closed form expressions of a class of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. In the context of regularized entropic transport these techniques provide new sharp entropic map estimates. When applied to the stability of Sinkhorn semigroups, they also yield
  a series of novel contraction estimates in terms of the fixed point of Riccati equations.
  The strength of our approach is that it is applicable to a large class of models arising in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. We illustrate the impact of our results in the context of regularized entropic transport, proximal samplers and diffusion generative models as well as diffusion flow matching models</description>
