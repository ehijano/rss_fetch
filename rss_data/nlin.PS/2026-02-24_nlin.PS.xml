      <title>Multi-ring necklace vortex solitons in Kerr nonlinear media with azimuthally modulated Bessel potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the existence, stability, and dynamics of single-ring and multi-ring vorticity-carrying necklace solitons under the action of the Kerr nonlinearity and a Bessel-lattice potential modulated in the azimuthal direction. The model may be realized in the spatial domain for bulk optical waveguides, the spatiotemporal domain for optical cavities, and for effectively two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. The setup supports single- and multi-ring necklace vortex patterns, including monopoles, dipoles, tripoles, quadrupoles, pentapoles, sextupoles, octupoles, and 12-poles. In contrast with the inherent instability of conventional vortex beams with high topological charges (winding numbers), vortex necklace-shaped solitons with large winding numbers are found to be stable in the present setup. In particular, octupoles exhibit stable breathing dynamics, and 12-pole necklaces with high winding numbers may be stable. These findings provide a new way for generating stable vortex necklaces, offering a vast potential for manipulations of complex spatiotemporal light fields.</description>

      <title>Superflows around corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the dynamics of a two-dimensional superflow governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation passing over finite-size rectangular obstacles: an impenetrable wall and an impenetrable rectangular well. Extending classical studies of vortex nucleation around smooth obstacles, we focus on the role of sharp corners in determining the onset of vortex nucleation. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on the Schwarz-Christoffel methods for potential flow and on numerical simulations, we show that local velocity amplification near sharp corners crucially controls the critical flow velocity for vortex nucleation.
  For both wall and well configurations, we identify analytically and theoretically the critical velocities as a function of the obstacle width and its height or depth, finding an excellent agreement between the theory and our numerical simulations. Our results provide a simple framework for understanding superflow stability past finite-size obstacles with sharp features and are directly relevant to experimentally realizable configurations in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and related superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Piecewise integrability of the discrete Hasimoto map for analytic prediction and design of helical peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representation of protein backbone geometry through the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation provides a theoretical connection between biological structure and integrable systems. Although the global application of this framework is constrained by chiral degeneracies and non-local interactions, helical peptides can be modeled as piecewise integrable systems where the discrete Hasimoto map remains applicable within specific geometric boundaries. We delineate these boundaries through an analytic mapping $(\phi,\psi) \rightarrow (\kappa,\tau)$ between biochemical dihedral angles and Frenet frame parameters for 50 helical peptide chains. This transformation is globally information-preserving but ill-conditioned within the helical basin (median Jacobian condition number 31), suggesting chiral information loss arises primarily from local coordinate compression rather than topological singularities. Using a local integrability error $E[n]$ derived from the discrete dispersion relation, we show deviations from integrability are driven predominantly by torsion non-uniformity, while curvature remains rigid. This metric identifies integrable islands where the analytic dispersion relation predicts backbone coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy (median RMSD 0.77\,\AA), enabling a segmentation strategy that isolates structural defects and trims non-integrable terminal fraying. Evaluating only these integrable islands, the dispersion relation extracts high-accuracy structural cores for 88\% of the dataset. Inverse backbone design is feasible within a defined integrability zone where the design constraint reduces essentially to controlling torsion uniformity. These findings advance the Hasimoto formalism from a qualitative descriptor toward a precise quantitative framework for analyzing and designing local protein geometry within the limits of piecewise integrability.</description>
