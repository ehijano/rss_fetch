      <title>Deepfake Audio Detection Using Spectrogram-based Feature and Ensemble of Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning based system for the task of deepfake audio detection. In particular, the draw input audio is first transformed into various spectrograms using three transformation methods of Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), Wavelet Transform (WT) combined with different auditory-based filters of Mel, Gammatone, linear filters (LF), and discrete cosine transform (DCT). Given the spectrograms, we evaluate a wide range of classification models based on three deep learning approaches. The first approach is to train directly the spectrograms using our proposed baseline models of CNN-based model (CNN-baseline), RNN-based model (RNN-baseline), C-RNN model (C-RNN baseline). Meanwhile, the second approach is transfer learning from computer vision models such as ResNet-18, MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet-121, SuffleNet-V2, Swint, Convnext-Tiny, GoogLeNet, MNASsnet, RegNet. In the third approach, we leverage the state-of-the-art audio pre-trained models of Whisper, Seamless, Speechbrain, and Pyannote to extract audio embeddings from the input spectrograms. Then, the audio embeddings are explored by a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to detect the fake or real audio samples. Finally, high-performance deep learning models from these approaches are fused to achieve the best performance. We evaluated our proposed models on ASVspoof 2019 benchmark dataset. Our best ensemble model achieved an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.03, which is highly competitive to top-performing systems in the ASVspoofing 2019 challenge. Experimental results also highlight the potential of selective spectrograms and deep learning approaches to enhance the task of audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Constant Directivity Loudspeaker Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loudspeaker array beamforming is a common signal processing technique for acoustic directivity control and robust audio reproduction. Unlike their microphone counterpart, loudspeaker constraints are often heterogeneous due to arrayed transducers with varying operating ranges in frequency, acoustic-electrical sensitivity, efficiency, and directivity. This work proposes a frequency-regularization method for generalized Rayleigh quotient directivity specifications and two novel beamformer designs that optimize for maximum efficiency constant directivity (MECD) and maximum sensitivity constant directivity (MSCD). We derive fast converging and analytic solutions from their quadratic equality constrained quadratic program formulations. Experiments optimize generalized directivity index constrained beamformer designs for a full-band heterogeneous array.</description>

      <title>Towards Training Music Taggers on Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most contemporary music tagging systems rely on large volumes of annotated data. As an alternative, we investigate the extent to which synthetically generated music excerpts can improve tagging systems when only small annotated collections are available. To this end, we release GTZAN-synth, a synthetic dataset that follows the taxonomy of the well-known GTZAN dataset while being ten times larger in data volume. We first observe that simply adding this synthetic dataset to the training split of GTZAN does not result into performance improvements. We then proceed to investigating domain adaptation, transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies for the task at hand and draw the conclusion that the last two options yield an increase in accuracy. Overall, the proposed approach can be considered as a first guide in a promising field for future research.</description>

      <title>GMM-ResNet2: Ensemble of Group ResNet Networks for Synthetic Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for speaker recognition and spoofing speech detection. We propose the GMM-ResNet2 for synthesis speech detection. Compared with the previous GMM-ResNet model, GMM-ResNet2 has four improvements. Firstly, the different order GMMs have different capabilities to form smooth approximations to the feature distribution, and multiple GMMs are used to extract multi-scale Log Gaussian Probability features. Secondly, the grouping technique is used to improve the classification accuracy by exposing the group cardinality while reducing both the number of parameters and the training time. The final score is obtained by ensemble of all group classifier outputs using the averaging method. Thirdly, the residual block is improved by including one activation function and one batch normalization layer. Finally, an ensemble-aware loss function is proposed to integrate the independent loss functions of all ensemble members. On the ASVspoof 2019 LA task, the GMM-ResNet2 achieves a minimum t-DCF of 0.0227 and an EER of 0.79\%. On the ASVspoof 2021 LA task, the GMM-ResNet2 achieves a minimum t-DCF of 0.2362 and an EER of 2.19\%, and represents a relative reductions of 31.4\% and 76.3\% compared with the LFCC-LCNN baseline.</description>

      <title>MelodyT5: A Unified Score-to-Score Transformer for Symbolic Music Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of symbolic music research, the progress of developing scalable systems has been notably hindered by the scarcity of available training data and the demand for models tailored to specific tasks. To address these issues, we propose MelodyT5, a novel unified framework that leverages an encoder-decoder architecture tailored for symbolic music processing in ABC notation. This framework challenges the conventional task-specific approach, considering various symbolic music tasks as score-to-score transformations. Consequently, it integrates seven melody-centric tasks, from generation to harmonization and segmentation, within a single model. Pre-trained on MelodyHub, a newly curated collection featuring over 261K unique melodies encoded in ABC notation and encompassing more than one million task instances, MelodyT5 demonstrates superior performance in symbolic music processing via multi-task transfer learning. Our findings highlight the efficacy of multi-task transfer learning in symbolic music processing, particularly for data-scarce tasks, challenging the prevailing task-specific paradigms and offering a comprehensive dataset and framework for future explorations in this domain.</description>

      <title>The Solution for Temporal Sound Localisation Task of ICCV 1st Perception Test Challenge 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a solution for improving the quality of temporal sound localization. We employ a multimodal fusion approach to combine visual and audio features. High-quality visual features are extracted using a state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training network, resulting in efficient video feature representations. At the same time, audio features serve as complementary information to help the model better localize the start and end of sounds. The fused features are trained in a multi-scale Transformer for training. In the final test dataset, we achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.33, obtaining the second-best performance in this track.</description>

      <title>SpeakerBeam-SS: Real-time Target Speaker Extraction with Lightweight Conv-TasNet and State Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time target speaker extraction (TSE) is intended to extract the desired speaker's voice from the observed mixture of multiple speakers in a streaming manner. Implementing real-time TSE is challenging as the computational complexity must be reduced to provide real-time operation. This work introduces to Conv-TasNet-based TSE a new architecture based on state space modeling (SSM) that has been shown to model long-term dependency effectively. Owing to SSM, fewer dilated convolutional layers are required to capture temporal dependency in Conv-TasNet, resulting in the reduction of model complexity. We also enlarge the window length and shift of the convolutional (TasNet) frontend encoder to reduce the computational cost further; the performance decline is compensated by over-parameterization of the frontend encoder. The proposed method reduces the real-time factor by 78% from the conventional causal Conv-TasNet-based TSE while matching its performance.</description>

      <title>Pinyin Regularization in Error Correction for Chinese Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in error correction for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, much of the research focuses on the English language. This paper redirects the attention to Chinese. Firstly, we construct a specialized benchmark dataset aimed at error correction for Chinese ASR with 724K hypotheses-transcription pairs, named the Chinese Hypotheses Paradise dataset (ChineseHP), which contains a wide range of scenarios and presents significant challenges. Subsequently, we conduct a preliminary evaluation using the dataset for both direct-prompting and fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method of Pinyin regularization for prompts, which involves the transcription of Pinyin directly from text hypotheses. The experimental results reveal that Pinyin regularization consistently enhances the error-correcting ability of LLMs when compared with those without regularization. The dataset is available on the website.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effects of Large-Scale Pseudo-Stereo Data and Different Speech Foundation Model on Dialogue Generative Spoken Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts in Spoken Dialogue Modeling aim to synthesize spoken dialogue without the need for direct transcription, thereby preserving the wealth of non-textual information inherent in speech. However, this approach faces a challenge when speakers talk simultaneously, requiring stereo dialogue data with speakers recorded on separate channels, a notably scarce resource. To address this, we have developed an innovative pipeline capable of transforming single-channel dialogue data into pseudo-stereo data. This expanded our training dataset from a mere 2,000 to an impressive 17,600 hours, significantly enriching the diversity and quality of the training examples available. The inclusion of this pseudo-stereo data has proven to be effective in improving the performance of spoken dialogue language models. Additionally, we explored the use of discrete units of different speech foundation models for spoken dialogue generation.</description>

      <title>SAVE: Segment Audio-Visual Easy way using Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) is to precisely identify and locate auditory elements within visual scenes by accurately predicting segmentation masks at the pixel level. Achieving this involves comprehensively considering data and model aspects to address this task effectively. This study presents a lightweight approach, SAVE, which efficiently adapts the pre-trained segment anything model (SAM) to the AVS task. By incorporating an image encoder adapter into the transformer blocks to better capture the distinct dataset information and proposing a residual audio encoder adapter to encode the audio features as a sparse prompt, our proposed model achieves effective audio-visual fusion and interaction during the encoding stage. Our proposed method accelerates the training and inference speed by reducing the input resolution from 1024 to 256 pixels while achieving higher performance compared with the previous SOTA. Extensive experimentation validates our approach, demonstrating that our proposed model outperforms other SOTA methods significantly. Moreover, leveraging the pre-trained model on synthetic data enhances performance on real AVSBench data, achieving 84.59 mIoU on the S4 (V1S) subset and 70.28 mIoU on the MS3 (V1M) set with only 256 pixels for input images. This increases up to 86.16 mIoU on the S4 (V1S) and 70.83 mIoU on the MS3 (V1M) with inputs of 1024 pixels.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Speech Summarization Using Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstractive Speech Summarization (SSum) aims to generate human-like text summaries from spoken content. It encounters difficulties in handling long speech input and capturing the intricate cross-modal mapping between long speech inputs and short text summaries. Research on large language models (LLMs) and multimodal information fusion has provided new insights for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SSum model that utilizes Q-Former as a connector for the audio-text modality and employs LLMs to generate text summaries directly from speech features. We adopt a multi-stage training approach that includes LLM based ASR and Text Summarization (TSum) tasks as auxiliary tasks. ASR tasks are used to align feature spaces and enhance the LLM's ability to handle longer speech. Then, we utilize a curriculum learning strategy to facilitate the model's transition from TSum to SSum. Finally, our model achieves competitive performance on the How-2 dataset.</description>

      <title>Accompanied Singing Voice Synthesis with Fully Text-controlled Melody</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-song (TTSong) is a music generation task that synthesizes accompanied singing voices. Current TTSong methods, inherited from singing voice synthesis (SVS), require melody-related information that can sometimes be impractical, such as music scores or MIDI sequences. We present MelodyLM, the first TTSong model that generates high-quality song pieces with fully text-controlled melodies, achieving minimal user requirements and maximum control flexibility. MelodyLM explicitly models MIDI as the intermediate melody-related feature and sequentially generates vocal tracks in a language model manner, conditioned on textual and vocal prompts. The accompaniment music is subsequently synthesized by a latent diffusion model with hybrid conditioning for temporal alignment. With minimal requirements, users only need to input lyrics and a reference voice to synthesize a song sample. For full control, just input textual prompts or even directly input MIDI. Experimental results indicate that MelodyLM achieves superior performance in terms of both objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are available at https://melodylm666.github.io.</description>

      <title>The USTC-NERCSLIP Systems for The ICMC-ASR Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report describes the submitted system to the In-Car Multi-Channel Automatic Speech Recognition (ICMC-ASR) challenge, which considers the ASR task with multi-speaker overlapping and Mandarin accent dynamics in the ICMC case. We implement the front-end speaker diarization using the self-supervised learning representation based multi-speaker embedding and beamforming using the speaker position, respectively. For ASR, we employ an iterative pseudo-label generation method based on fusion model to obtain text labels of unsupervised data. To mitigate the impact of accent, an Accent-ASR framework is proposed, which captures pronunciation-related accent features at a fine-grained level and linguistic information at a coarse-grained level. On the ICMC-ASR eval set, the proposed system achieves a CER of 13.16% on track 1 and a cpCER of 21.48% on track 2, which significantly outperforms the official baseline system and obtains the first rank on both tracks.</description>

      <title>Robust Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Reverse Inference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose reverse inference optimization (RIO), a simple and effective method designed to enhance the robustness of autoregressive-model-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To assess the quality of speech produced by the TTS system without human annotations, RIO introduces a novel concept termed as reverse inference based on the Bayesian principle, which suggests that a high-quality generated speech should be able to be used as a prompt for subsequent generation using the same TTS model. By leveraging reverse inference as the standard to select exemplars used in RLHF from the speech samples generated by the TTS system itself, RIO steers the subsequent optimization towards a direction of enhancing the TTS robustness. The RIO framework, comprising sampling, automatic annotating, and learning, obviates the need for a reward model or pairwise preference data, and significantly improves the stability of zero-shot TTS performance by reducing the discrepancies between training and inference conditions. Our experimental results verify that RIO can effectively improve both subjective and objective metrics, including mean opinion scores, word error rates, and speaker similarity. Remarkably, RIO can also diminish the incidence of bad outputs to nearly zero percent, rivalling the robustness when using ground-truth speech as the prompt.</description>

      <title>SOAF: Scene Occlusion-aware Neural Acoustic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of novel view audio-visual synthesis along an arbitrary trajectory in an indoor scene, given the audio-video recordings from other known trajectories of the scene. Existing methods often overlook the effect of room geometry, particularly wall occlusion to sound propagation, making them less accurate in multi-room environments. In this work, we propose a new approach called Scene Occlusion-aware Acoustic Field (SOAF) for accurate sound generation. Our approach derives a prior for sound energy field using distance-aware parametric sound-propagation modelling and then transforms it based on scene transmittance learned from the input video. We extract features from the local acoustic field centred around the receiver using a Fibonacci Sphere to generate binaural audio for novel views with a direction-aware attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the real dataset~\emph{RWAVS} and the synthetic dataset~\emph{SoundSpaces} demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques in audio generation.

      <title>ADD 2022: the First Audio Deep Synthesis Detection Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection is an emerging topic, which was included in the ASVspoof 2021. However, the recent shared tasks have not covered many real-life and challenging scenarios. The first Audio Deep synthesis Detection challenge (ADD) was motivated to fill in the gap. The ADD 2022 includes three tracks: low-quality fake audio detection (LF), partially fake audio detection (PF) and audio fake game (FG). The LF track focuses on dealing with bona fide and fully fake utterances with various real-world noises etc. The PF track aims to distinguish the partially fake audio from the real. The FG track is a rivalry game, which includes two tasks: an audio generation task and an audio fake detection task. In this paper, we describe the datasets, evaluation metrics, and protocols. We also report major findings that reflect the recent advances in audio deepfake detection tasks.</description>

      <title>ARAUS: A Large-Scale Dataset and Baseline Models of Affective Responses to Augmented Urban Soundscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choosing optimal maskers for existing soundscapes to effect a desired perceptual change via soundscape augmentation is non-trivial due to extensive varieties of maskers and a dearth of benchmark datasets with which to compare and develop soundscape augmentation models. To address this problem, we make publicly available the ARAUS (Affective Responses to Augmented Urban Soundscapes) dataset, which comprises a five-fold cross-validation set and independent test set totaling 25,440 unique subjective perceptual responses to augmented soundscapes presented as audio-visual stimuli. Each augmented soundscape is made by digitally adding "maskers" (bird, water, wind, traffic, construction, or silence) to urban soundscape recordings at fixed soundscape-to-masker ratios. Responses were then collected by asking participants to rate how pleasant, annoying, eventful, uneventful, vibrant, monotonous, chaotic, calm, and appropriate each augmented soundscape was, in accordance with ISO 12913-2:2018. Participants also provided relevant demographic information and completed standard psychological questionnaires. We perform exploratory and statistical analysis of the responses obtained to verify internal consistency and agreement with known results in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the benchmarking capability of the dataset by training and comparing four baseline models for urban soundscape pleasantness: a low-parameter regression model, a high-parameter convolutional neural network, and two attention-based networks in the literature.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Soundscape Augmentation with Multimodal Fusion of Visual and Participant-linked Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous soundscape augmentation systems typically use trained models to pick optimal maskers to effect a desired perceptual change. While acoustic information is paramount to such systems, contextual information, including participant demographics and the visual environment, also influences acoustic perception. Hence, we propose modular modifications to an existing attention-based deep neural network, to allow early, mid-level, and late feature fusion of participant-linked, visual, and acoustic features. Ablation studies on module configurations and corresponding fusion methods using the ARAUS dataset show that contextual features improve the model performance in a statistically significant manner on the normalized ISO Pleasantness, to a mean squared error of $0.1194\pm0.0012$ for the best-performing all-modality model, against $0.1217\pm0.0009$ for the audio-only model. Soundscape augmentation systems can thereby leverage multimodal inputs for improved performance. We also investigate the impact of individual participant-linked factors using trained models to illustrate improvements in model explainability.</description>

      <title>Naturalistic Music Decoding from EEG Data via Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the potential of using latent diffusion models, a family of powerful generative models, for the task of reconstructing naturalistic music from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Unlike simpler music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces, the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments, voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. We additionally perform song classification based on the generated tracks. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory information reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Speaker-Smoothed kNN Speaker Adaptation for End-to-End ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent improvements in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (E2E ASR) systems, the performance can degrade due to vocal characteristic mismatches between training and testing data, particularly with limited target speaker adaptation data. We propose a novel speaker adaptation approach Speaker-Smoothed kNN that leverages k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) retrieval techniques to improve model output by finding correctly pronounced tokens from its pre-built datastore during the decoding phase. Moreover, we utilize x-vector to dynamically adjust kNN interpolation parameters for data sparsity issue. This approach was validated using KeSpeech and MagicData corpora under in-domain and all-domain settings. Our method consistently performs comparably to fine-tuning without the associated performance degradation during speaker changes. Furthermore, in the all-domain setting, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing the CER in both single speaker and multi-speaker test scenarios.</description>

      <title>SlideAVSR: A Dataset of Paper Explanation Videos for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a multimodal extension of automatic speech recognition (ASR), using video as a complement to audio. In AVSR, considerable efforts have been directed at datasets for facial features such as lip-readings, while they often fall short in evaluating the image comprehension capabilities in broader contexts. In this paper, we construct SlideAVSR, an AVSR dataset using scientific paper explanation videos. SlideAVSR provides a new benchmark where models transcribe speech utterances with texts on the slides on the presentation recordings. As technical terminologies that are frequent in paper explanations are notoriously challenging to transcribe without reference texts, our SlideAVSR dataset spotlights a new aspect of AVSR problems. As a simple yet effective baseline, we propose DocWhisper, an AVSR model that can refer to textual information from slides, and confirm its effectiveness on SlideAVSR.</description>

      <title>Fusing Audio and Metadata Embeddings Improves Language-based Audio Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching raw audio signals with textual descriptions requires understanding the audio's content and the description's semantics and then drawing connections between the two modalities. This paper investigates a hybrid retrieval system that utilizes audio metadata as an additional clue to understand the content of audio signals before matching them with textual queries. We experimented with metadata often attached to audio recordings, such as keywords and natural-language descriptions, and we investigated late and mid-level fusion strategies to merge audio and metadata. Our hybrid approach with keyword metadata and late fusion improved the retrieval performance over a content-based baseline by 2.36 and 3.69 pp. mAP@10 on the ClothoV2 and AudioCaps benchmarks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Speech Representation Learning for Thousands of Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has helped extend speech technologies to more languages by reducing the need for labeled data. However, models are still far from supporting the world's 7000+ languages. We propose XEUS, a Cross-lingual Encoder for Universal Speech, trained on over 1 million hours of data across 4057 languages, extending the language coverage of SSL models 4-fold. We combine 1 million hours of speech from existing publicly accessible corpora with a newly created corpus of 7400+ hours from 4057 languages, which will be publicly released. To handle the diverse conditions of multilingual speech data, we augment the typical SSL masked prediction approach with a novel dereverberation objective, increasing robustness. We evaluate XEUS on several benchmarks, and show that it consistently outperforms or achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL models across a variety of tasks. XEUS sets a new SOTA on the ML-SUPERB benchmark: it outperforms MMS 1B and w2v-BERT 2.0 v2 by 0.8% and 4.4% respectively, despite having less parameters or pre-training data. Checkpoints, code, and data are found in https://www.wavlab.org/activities/2024/xeus/.</description>
