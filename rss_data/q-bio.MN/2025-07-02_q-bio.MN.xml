      <title>Classifying Hotspots Mutations for Biosimulation with Quantum Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomolecular datasets presents significant challenges for computational biology. Quantum computing emerges as a promising solution to address these complexities. This study introduces a novel quantum framework for analyzing TART-T and TART-C gene data by integrating genomic and structural information. Leveraging a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), we classify hotspot mutations, utilizing quantum superposition to uncover intricate relationships within the data. Additionally, a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is employed to estimate molecular ground-state energies through a hybrid classical-quantum approach, overcoming the limitations of traditional computational methods. Implemented using IBM Qiskit, our framework demonstrates high accuracy in both mutation classification and energy estimation on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. These results underscore the potential of quantum computing to advance the understanding of gene function and protein structure. Furthermore, this research serves as a foundational blueprint for extending quantum computational methods to other genes and biological systems, highlighting their synergy with classical approaches and paving the way for breakthroughs in drug discovery and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Spatiotemporal Forecasting of HIV Clusters</title>

Abstract: HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced computation for accurate cluster detection and forecasting. We employed quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved 92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart. Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways. This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for PrEP, and address structural inequities fueling HIV transmission.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Space of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>

Abstract: Living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and consume energy to sustain emergent organized states. Their robust functioning rely on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRN) in which the external energy supply often comes from fluxes that can keep some species concentrations constant. Hence, to capture the emergent complexity of living systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature, it is fundamental to uncover constraints and properties of the CRNs underpinning their functions. In particular, while kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of these underlying CRNs is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we derive universal thermodynamic upper and lower bounds for species concentrations in a generic CRN operating within a given energy budget. The resulting region determines the thermodynamic space of the CRN, a concept we introduce in this work that determines the range of accessible concentrations for the chemical species involved at a given value of non-equilibrium driving. We obtain similar bounds for the affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total dissipation, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, the Schlogl model for bistability, a minimal self-assembly process, a paradigmatic system exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking, and a multi-molecular model for reaction-diffusion patterns, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analyzing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.</description>
