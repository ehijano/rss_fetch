      <title>Escape from a metastable state in non-Markovian population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics in non-Markovian single-population stochastic models, where one or more reactions are modelled as a stochastic process with a fat-tailed non-exponential distribution of waiting times, mimicking long-term memory. We focus on three prototypical examples: genetic switching, population establishment and population extinction, all with non-exponential production rates. The system is studied in two regimes. In the first, the distribution of waiting times has a finite mean. Here, the system approaches a (quasi)stationary steady state at long times, and we develop a general WKB approach for these non-Markovian systems. We derive explicit results for the mean population size and mean escape time from the metastable state of the stochastic dynamics. In this realm, we reveal that for sufficiently strong memory, a memory-induced (meta)stable state can emerge in the system. In the second regime, the waiting time distribution is assumed to have an infinite mean. Here, for bistable systems we find two distinct scaling regimes, separated by an exponentially long time which may strongly depend on the initial conditions of the system.</description>

      <title>A systematic framework to construct unconventional superconducting pairing scar states using multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multi-body interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multi-body interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has the same interaction energy by cancelling the two-body and multi-body interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multi-body interactions has the $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, the entanglement entropy, and the level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice, $s$-wave pairing states in a nearest-neighbor interacting system, and spinless $p$-wave pairing states in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence an expected phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Critical Properties of Weak Measurement Induced Phase Transitions in Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of different forms of weak measurements on the nature of the measurement induced phase transition are theoretically studied in hybrid random quantum circuits of qubits. We use a combination of entanglement measures, ancilla purification dynamics, and a transfer matrix approach to compute the critical exponents, the effective central charge, and the multifractal spectrum of the measurement induced transitions. We compare weak measurements with an infinite number of discrete outcomes to a protocol with only a pair of outcomes and find that to within our numerical accuracy the universal critical properties are unaffected by the weak measurement protocols and are consistent with the universality class found for strong projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Goldilocks quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goldilocks quantum cellular automata (QCA) have been simulated on quantum hardware and produce emergent small-world correlation networks. In Goldilocks QCA, a single-qubit unitary is applied to each qubit in a one-dimensional chain subject to a balance constraint: a qubit is updated if its neighbors are in opposite basis states. Here, we prove that a subclass of Goldilocks QCA -- including the one implemented experimentally -- map onto free fermions and therefore can be classically simulated efficiently. We support this claim with two independent proofs, one involving a Jordan--Wigner transformation and one mapping the integrable six-vertex model to QCA. We compute local conserved quantities of these QCA and predict experimentally measurable expectation values. These calculations can be applied to test large digital quantum computers against known solutions. In contrast, typical Goldilocks QCA have equilibration properties and quasienergy-level statistics that suggest nonintegrability. Still, the latter QCA conserve one quantity useful for error mitigation. Our work provides a parametric quantum circuit with tunable integrability properties with which to test quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Simulating Holographic Conformal Field Theories on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally lead to a genuine realization of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commonly, the notion of "quantum chaos'' refers to the fast scrambling of information throughout complex quantum systems undergoing unitary evolution. Motivated by the Krylov complexity and the operator growth hypothesis, we demonstrate that the entropy of the population distribution for an operator in time is a useful way to capture the complexity of the internal information dynamics of a system when subject to an environment and is, in principle, agnostic to the specific choice of operator basis. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, examining the dynamics of the system in both its Krylov basis and the basis of operator strings. We prove that the former basis minimises spread complexity while the latter is an eigenbasis for high dissipation. In both cases, we probe the long-time dynamics of the model and the phenomenological effects of decoherence on the complexity of the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By mapping the calculation of Mazur bounds to the enumeration of walks on fractal structures, we present exact bounds on the late-time behavior of spin autocorrelation functions in models exhibiting pair-flip dynamics and more general $p$-flip dynamics. While the pair-flip model is known to exhibit strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the effect of its nontrivial conservation laws on autocorrelation functions has, thus far, only been calculated numerically, which has led to incorrect conclusions about their thermodynamic behavior. Here, using exact results, we prove that infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions exhibit infinite coherence times at the boundary, and that bulk Mazur bounds decay asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{L}$, rather than $1/L$, as had previously been thought. This result implies that the nontrivial conserved operators implied by $p$-flip dynamics have an important qualitative impact on bulk thermalization properties beyond the constraints imposed by the simple global symmetries of the models.</description>

      <title>Interactions Between Different Birds of Prey as a Random Point Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Coulomb gas is a one-parameter family of random point processes, depending on the inverse temperature $\beta$. Based on previous work, it is proposed as a simple statistical measure to quantify the intra- and interspecies repulsion among three different highly territorial birds of prey. Using data from the area of the Teutoburger Wald over 20 years, we fit the nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions between the respective nests of Goshawk, Eagle Owl and the previously examined Common Buzzard to $\beta$ of the Coulomb gas. Within each species, the repulsion measured in this way deviates significantly from the Poisson process of independent points in the plane. In contrast, the repulsion amongst each of two species is found to be considerably lower and closer to Poisson. Methodologically we investigate the influence of the terrain, of a shorter interaction range given by the two-dimensional Yukawa interaction, and the statistical independence of the time moving average we use for the yearly ensembles of occupied nests. We also check that an artificial random displacement of the original nest positions of the order of the mean level spacing quickly destroys the repulsion measured by $\beta&gt; 0$. A simple, approximate analytical expression for the nearest neighbour spacing distribution derived from non-Hermitian random matrix theory proves to be very useful.</description>

Abstract: Does the quantum equipartition theorem truly exist for any given system? If so, what is the concrete form of such a theorem? The extension of the equipartition theorem, a fundamental principle in classical statistical physics, to the quantum regime raises these two crucial questions. In the present Letter, we focus on how to answer them for arbitray systems. For this propose, the inverse problem of the quantum equipartition theorem has been successfully solved. This result, termed as the inverse equipartition theorem, toghther with nonnegativity and normalizability of the distribution function $\mathbb{P}(\omega)$ serves as a criterion for determining whether a given system adheres to quantum equipartition theorem. If yes, the concrete form of the theorem can be readily obtained. Fermionic version of them is also discussed.Our results can be viewed as a general solution to the topics of quantum equipartition theorem.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems, by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a detailed fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of what is meant by a meanfield. Meanfields are approximately maps - through some self consistency relation - of a complex, usually manybody, problem to a simpler more readily solvable problem. This mapping can then be solved to represent properties of the complex many body problem using some self consistency relations. Prototypical examples of simpler meanfield problems (meanfield systems) are the single site and free particle problems. Here we propose a new class of simple meanfield systems where the simple problem to be solved is a 1D spin chain. These meanfields are particularly useful for studying quasi-1D models, where there is a 3D system composed of weakly coupled 1D spin chains with the coupling in the transverse direction weaker than in the 1D direction. We illustrate this idea by considering meanfields for the Ising (of any coupling sign) and ferromagnetic Heisenberg models with one direction coupled much more strongly then the other directions (quasi-1D systems) which map at meanfield level onto the 1D Ising and 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg models. We also consider more exotic models to illustrate other methods of solving 1D systems, namely the $N$-state Potts model. Magnetic phase transition temperatures and are obtained for all three models, we see that they significantly differ from the usual meanfield estimates. Indeed if the 1D direction has coupling $\Gamma$ and the transverse directions have coupling $J$ with $\lambda\sim\frac{\Gamma}{J}\gg1$ then regular meanfield would predict the transition temperature to be $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\Gamma$ for all three models while 1D meanfield predicts temperatures of $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\log\left(\lambda\right)}$ for the Ising and Potts models and $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$ for the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Cluster 1D meanfield extensions are also proposed.</description>

      <title>A replica analysis of Self-Training of Linear Classifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-training (ST) is a simple and standard approach in semi-supervised learning that has been applied to many machine learning problems. Despite its widespread acceptance and practical effectiveness, it is still not well understood why and how ST improves performance by fitting the model to potentially erroneous pseudo-labels. To investigate the properties of ST, in this study, we derive and analyze a sharp characterization of the behavior of iterative ST when training a linear classifier by minimizing the ridge-regularized convex loss for binary Gaussian mixtures, in the asymptotic limit where input dimension and data size diverge proportionally. The derivation is based on the replica method of statistical mechanics. The result indicates that, when the total number of iterations is large, ST may find a classification plane with the optimal direction regardless of the label imbalance by accumulating small parameter updates over long iterations. It is argued that this is because the small update of ST can accumulate information of the data in an almost noiseless way. However, when a label imbalance is present in true labels, the performance of the ST is significantly lower than that of supervised learning with true labels, because the ratio between the norm of the weight and the magnitude of the bias can become significantly large. To overcome the problems in label imbalanced cases, several heuristics are introduced. By numerically analyzing the asymptotic formula, it is demonstrated that with the proposed heuristics, ST can find a classifier whose performance is nearly compatible with supervised learning using true labels even in the presence of significant label imbalance.</description>

Abstract: We use a standard minimal active Brownian model to investigate the osmotic-like effective pressure generated by active fluids on fixed hollow inclusions. These inclusions are enclosed by a permeable (albeit nonflexible) membrane, and the interior and exterior regions of the inclusions have different particle motility strengths. We consider both rectangular and disklike inclusions and analyze the effects of various system parameters, such as excluded volume interaction between active particles, hardness of membrane and active particle density, on the effective pressure produced on the enclosing membrane. We focus on the range of intermediate to high motility strengths and analyze the effective pressure in the steady state. Our findings for the active pressure produced in the interior and exterior regions of the inclusion indicate that the pressure is higher in the region with lower motility due to the relatively stronger accumulation of active particles.</description>

      <title>Mapping of attention mechanisms to a generalized Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07235</link>

Abstract: Transformers are neural networks that revolutionized natural language processing and machine learning. They process sequences of inputs, like words, using a mechanism called self-attention, which is trained via masked language modeling (MLM). In MLM, a word is randomly masked in an input sequence, and the network is trained to predict the missing word. Despite the practical success of transformers, it remains unclear what type of data distribution self-attention can learn efficiently. Here, we show analytically that if one decouples the treatment of word positions and embeddings, a single layer of self-attention learns the conditionals of a generalized Potts model with interactions between sites and Potts colors. Moreover, we show that training this neural network is exactly equivalent to solving the inverse Potts problem by the so-called pseudo-likelihood method, well known in statistical physics. Using this mapping, we compute the generalization error of self-attention in a model scenario analytically using the replica method.</description>

      <title>General theory of the viscosity of liquids and solids from nonaffine particle motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new microscopic formula for the viscosity of liquids and solids is derived rigorously from a first-principles (microscopically reversible) Hamiltonian for particle-bath atomistic motion. The derivation is done within the framework of nonaffine linear response theory. The new formula may lead to a valid alternative to the Green-Kubo approach to describe the viscosity of condensed matter systems from molecular simulations without having to fit long-time tails. Furthermore, it provides a direct link between the viscosity, the vibrational density of states of the system, and the zero-frequency limit of the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Ground-State Quantum Algorithms based on Neural Schr\"odinger Forging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement forging based variational algorithms leverage the bi-partition of quantum systems for addressing ground state problems. The primary limitation of these approaches lies in the exponential summation required over the numerous potential basis states, or bitstrings, when performing the Schmidt decomposition of the whole system. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new method for entanglement forging employing generative neural networks to identify the most pertinent bitstrings, eliminating the need for the exponential sum. Through empirical demonstrations on systems of increasing complexity, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable or superior performance compared to the existing standard implementation of entanglement forging. Moreover, by controlling the amount of required resources, this scheme can be applied to larger, as well as non permutation invariant systems, where the latter constraint is associated with the Heisenberg forging procedure. We substantiate our findings through numerical simulations conducted on spins models exhibiting one-dimensional ring, two-dimensional triangular lattice topologies, and nuclear shell model configurations.</description>

      <title>Separability criterion using one observable for special states: Entanglement detection via quantum quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting entanglement in many-body quantum systems is crucial but challenging, typically requiring multiple measurements. Here, we establish the class of states where measuring connected correlations in just $\textit{one}$ basis is sufficient and necessary to detect bipartite separability, provided the appropriate basis and observables are chosen. This methodology leverages prior information about the state, which, although insufficient to reveal the complete state or its entanglement, enables our one basis approach to be effective. We discuss the possibility of one observable entanglement detection in a variety of systems, including those without conserved charges, such as the Transverse Ising model, reaching the appropriate basis via quantum quench. This provides a much simpler pathway of detection than previous works. It also shows improved sensitivity from Pearson Correlation detection techniques.</description>

      <title>Parisi's hypercube, Fock-space fluxes, and the microscopics of near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parisi's hypercube model describes a charged particle hopping on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with disordered background fluxes in the large $d$ limit. It was noted previously [Jia and Verbaarschot, J. High Energy Phys. 11 (2020) 154] that the hypercube model at leading order in $1/d$ has the same spectral density as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model. In this work we identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the DS-SYK model, demonstrating that the hypercube model is an equally good microscopic model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube model is not $p$-local. Rather, we note that the shared feature between the two models is that they both have a large amount of disordered but uniform fluxes on their Fock-space graphs, and we propose this is a broader characterization of near-CFT$_1$ microscopics. Moreover, we suggest that the hypercube model can be viewed as the operator growth model of the DS-SYK model. We explain some universality in subleading corrections and relate them to bulk vertices. Finally, we revise a claim made the aforementioned reference about the existence of a spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Rational Q-systems at Root of Unity I. Closed Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solution of Bethe ansatz equations for XXZ spin chain with the parameter $q$ being a root of unity is infamously subtle. In this work, we develop the rational $Q$-system for this case, which offers a systematic way to find all physical solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations at root of unity. The construction contains two parts. In the first part, we impose additional constraints to the rational $Q$-system. These constraints eliminate the so-called Fabricius-McCoy (FM) string solutions, yielding all primitive solutions. In the second part, we give a simple procedure to construct the descendant tower of any given primitive state. The primitive solutions together with their descendant towers constitute the complete Hilbert space. We test our proposal by extensive numerical checks and apply it to compute the torus partition function of the 6-vertex model at root of unity.</description>

      <title>Shareability of Quantum Correlations in a Many-Body Spin System with Two- and Three-Body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shareability of quantum correlations among the constituent parties of a multiparty quantum system is restricted by the quantum information theoretic concept called monogamy. Depending on the multiparty quantum systems, different measures of quantum correlations show disparate signatures for monogamy. We characterize the shareability of quantum correlations, from both entanglement-separability and information-theoretic kinds, in a multiparty quantum spin system containing two- and three-body interactions with respect to its system parameters and external applied magnetic field. Monogamy score in this system exhibits both monogamous and non-monogamous traits depending on the quantum correlation measure, strengths of system parameters and external magnetic field. The percentage of non-monogamous states when the information-theoretic quantum correlations are considered is higher than that of the entanglement-separability kind in allowed ranges of these variables. The integral powers of the quantum correlation measures for which the non-monogamous states become monogamous are identified.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing non-Hermitian Many-Body Localization and Quantum Chaos via Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong local disorder in interacting quantum spin chains can turn delocalized eigenmodes into localized eigenstates, giving rise to many-body localized (MBL) phases. This is accompanied by distinct spectral statistics: chaotic for the delocalized phase and integrable for the localized phase. In isolated systems, localization and chaos are defined through a web of relations among eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and real-time dynamics. These may change as the system is made open. We ask whether random dissipation (without random disorder) can induce chaotic or localized behavior in an otherwise integrable system. The dissipation is described using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which can effectively be obtained from Markovian dynamics conditioned on null measurement. Through the use of the singular value decomposition and the introduction of new diagnostic tools complementing the singular-value statistics, namely, the singular form factor, the inverse participation ratio, and entanglement entropy for singular vectors, we provide a positive answer. Our method is illustrated in an XXZ Hamiltonian with random local dissipation.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the staggered six-vertex model with $U_q\big(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\big)$ invariant boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling limit of a statistical system, which is a special case of the integrable inhomogeneous six-vertex model. It possesses $U_q\big(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\big)$ invariance due to the choice of open boundary conditions imposed. An interesting feature of the lattice theory is that the spectrum of scaling dimensions contains a continuous component. By applying the ODE/IQFT correspondence and the method of the Baxter $Q$ operator the corresponding density of states is obtained. In addition, the partition function appearing in the scaling limit of the lattice model is computed, which may be of interest for the study of nonrational CFTs in the presence of boundaries. As a side result of the research, a simple formula for the matrix elements of the $Q$ operator for the general, integrable, inhomogeneous six-vertex model was discovered, that has not yet appeared in the literature. It is valid for a certain one parameter family of diagonal open boundary conditions in the sector with the $z\,$-projection of the total spin operator being equal to zero.</description>

      <title>Computing the Committor with the Committor: an Anatomy of the Transition State Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the kinetic bottlenecks that make transitions between metastable states difficult is key to understanding important physical problems like crystallization, chemical reactions, or protein folding. In all these phenomena, the system spends a considerable amount of time in one metastable state before making a rare but important transition to a new state. The rarity of these events makes their direct simulation challenging, if not impossible. We propose a method to explore the distribution of configurations that the system passes as it translocates from one metastable basin to another. We shall refer to this set of configurations as the transition state ensemble. We base our method on the committor function and the variational principle to which it obeys. We find the minimum of the variational principle via a self-consistent procedure that does not require any input besides the knowledge of the initial and final state. Right from the start, our procedure focuses on sampling the transition state ensemble and allows harnessing a large number of such configurations. With the help of the variational principle, we perform a detailed analysis of the transition state ensemble, ranking quantitatively the degrees of freedom mostly involved in the transition and opening the way for a systematic approach for the interpretation of simulation results and the construction of collective variables.</description>

      <title>Collapse and expansion kinetics of a single polyelectrolyte chain with hydrodynamic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collapse and expansion dynamics of a linear polyelectrolyte (PE) with hydrodynamic interactions. Using dissipative particle dynamics with a bead-spring PE model, long-range electrostatics and explicit ions we examine how the timescales of collapse $t_\text{col}$ and expansion $t_\text{exp}$ depend on the chain length $N$, and obtain scaling relationships $t_\text{col}\sim N^\alpha$ and $t_\text{exp}\sim N^\beta$. For neutral polymers, we derive values of $\alpha=0.94\pm0.01$ and $\beta=1.97\pm0.10$. Interestingly, the introduction of electrostatic interaction markedly shifts $\alpha$ to $\alpha\approx1.4\pm0.1$ for salt concentrations within $c=10^{-4}$ M to $10^{-2}$ M. A reduction in ion-to-monomer size ratio noticeably reduces $\alpha$. On the other hand, the expansion scaling remains approximately constant, $\beta \approx 2$, regardless of salt concentration or ion size considered. We find $\beta &gt; \alpha$ for all conditions considered, implying that expansion is always slower than collapse in the limit of long polymers. This asymmetry is explained by distinct kinetic pathways of collapse and expansion processes.</description>

      <title>Memory formation in dense persistent active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protocol-dependent states in structural glasses can encode a disordered, yet retrievable memory. While training such materials is typically done via a global drive, such as external shear, in dense active matter the driving is instead local and spatio-temporally correlated. Here we focus on the impact of such spatial correlation on memory formation. We investigate the mechanical response of a dense amorphous packing of athermal particles, subject to an oscillatory quasistatic driving with a tunable spatial correlation, akin to the instantaneous driving pattern in active matter. We find that the capacity to encode memory can be rendered comparable upon a proper rescaling on the spatial correlation, whereas the efficiency in memory formation increases with motion cooperativity.</description>
