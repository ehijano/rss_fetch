      <title>Using stationary information flows to prove kinetic uncertainty relations in biochemical control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cellular components are present in such low numbers that individual stochastic production and degradation events lead to significant fluctuations in molecular abundances. Although feedback control can, in principle, suppress such low-copy-number fluctuations, general rules have emerged that suggest fundamental performance constraints on feedback control in biochemical systems. In particular, previous work has conjectured that reducing abundance fluctuations in one component requires at least one sacrificial component with increased variability in arbitrary reaction networks of any size. Here, we present an exact and general proof of this statement based on probability current decompositions of mutual information rates between molecular abundances. This suggests that variability in cellular components is necessary for cellular control and that fluctuating components do not necessarily generate cellular "noise" but may correspond to control molecules that are involved in removing "noise" from other cellular components.</description>

      <title>Enzyme-Substrate Complex Formation Modulates Diffusion-Driven Patterning In Metabolic Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how enzymatic binding kinetics regulate diffusion-driven instabilities in a two-step metabolic pathway. Starting from a mechanistic description in which the substrate reversibly binds to the first enzyme before catalytic conversion, we formulate two reaction-diffusion models: a simplified system with effective kinetics and an extended model that explicitly includes the enzyme-substrate complex. The latter exhibits a structural degeneracy at critical parameter values due to a continuous family of homogeneous equilibria. To enable direct comparison and analytical progress, we introduce a reduced non-degenerate formulation via a quasi-equilibrium closure that encodes the influence of complex formation into effective reaction terms while preserving the nonlinear coupling between catalytic turnover and spatial transport.
  We show that explicit enzyme-substrate binding shifts the homogeneous steady state, modifies relaxation dynamics, and substantially alters the size and location of the Turing instability region relative to the simplified model. Numerical simulations are in close agreement with weakly nonlinear predictions, illustrating how reversible binding reshapes pattern selection and slows the development of spatial heterogeneity. These results establish a quantitative link between enzyme-substrate binding kinetics, diffusion-driven instabilities, and mesoscale spatial organization, including structures associated with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The proposed framework provides a mechanistic route by which association, dissociation, and catalytic rates jointly regulate the robustness and structure of spatial metabolic patterns, and can be extended to broader classes of compartmentalized biochemical networks.</description>
