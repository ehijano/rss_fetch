      <title>PokerBench: Training Large Language Models to become Professional Poker Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PokerBench - a benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a new challenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding of game theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models. PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker. However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements. We validate PokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates in actual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. PokerBench thus presents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios. The dataset and code will be made available at: \url{https://github.com/pokerllm/pokerbench}.</description>

      <title>New Fairness Concepts for Allocating Indivisible Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the fundamental problem of fairly dividing a set of indivisible items among agents, envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) and maximin fairness (MMS) are arguably the most compelling fairness concepts proposed until now. Unfortunately, despite significant efforts over the past few years, whether EFX allocations always exist is still an enigmatic open problem, let alone their efficient computation. Furthermore, today we know that MMS allocations are not always guaranteed to exist. These facts weaken the usefulness of both EFX and MMS, albeit their appealing conceptual characteristics. We propose two alternative fairness concepts, called epistemic EFX (EEFX) and minimum EFX share fairness (MXS), inspired by EFX and MMS. For both, we explore their relationships to well-studied fairness notions and, more importantly, prove that EEFX and MXS allocations always exist and can be computed efficiently for additive valuations. Our results justify that the new fairness concepts can be excellent alternatives to EFX and MMS.</description>

      <title>Analytically Tractable Models for Decision Making under Present Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-inconsistency is a characteristic of human behavior in which people plan for long-term benefits but take actions that differ from the plan due to conflicts with short-term benefits. Such time-inconsistent behavior is believed to be caused by present bias, a tendency to overestimate immediate rewards and underestimate future rewards. It is essential in behavioral economics to investigate the relationship between present bias and time-inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a model for analyzing agent behavior with present bias in tasks to make progress toward a goal over a specific period. Unlike previous models, the state sequence of the agent can be described analytically in our model. Based on this property, we analyze three crucial problems related to agents under present bias: task abandonment, optimal goal setting, and optimal reward scheduling. Extensive analysis reveals how present bias affects the condition under which task abandonment occurs and optimal intervention strategies. Our findings are meaningful for preventing task abandonment and intervening through incentives in the real world.</description>

      <title>United We Fall: On the Nash Equilibria of Multiplex and Multilayer Network Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network games provide a framework to study strategic decision making processes that are governed by structured interdependencies among agents. However, existing models do not account for environments in which agents simultaneously interact over multiple networks, or when agents operate over multiple action dimensions. In this paper, we propose new models of multiplex network games to capture the different modalities of interactions among strategic agents, and multilayer network games to capture their interactions over multiple action dimensions. We explore how the properties of the constituent networks of a multiplex/multilayer network can undermine or support the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the game's Nash equilibria. Notably, we highlight that both the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the constituent networks (reflecting their connectivity and two-sidedness, respectively) are instrumental in determining the uniqueness of the multiplex/multilayer network game's equilibrium. Together, our findings shed light on the reasons for the fragility of equilibria when agents interact over networks of networks, and point out potential interventions to alleviate them.</description>

      <title>To Analyze and Regulate Human-in-the-loop Learning for Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In congestion games, selfish users behave myopically to crowd to the shortest paths, and the social planner designs mechanisms to regulate such selfish routing through information or payment incentives. However, such mechanism design requires the knowledge of time-varying traffic conditions and it is the users themselves to learn and report past road experiences to the social planner (e.g., Waze or Google Maps). When congestion games meet mobile crowdsourcing, it is critical to incentivize selfish users to explore non-shortest paths in the best exploitation-exploration trade-off. First, we consider a simple but fundamental parallel routing network with one deterministic path and multiple stochastic paths for users with an average arrival probability $\lambda$. We prove that the current myopic routing policy (widely used in Waze and Google Maps) misses both exploration (when strong hazard belief) and exploitation (when weak hazard belief) as compared to the social optimum. Due to the myopic policy's under-exploration, we prove that the caused price of anarchy (PoA) is larger than \(\frac{1}{1-\rho^{\frac{1}{\lambda}}}\), which can be arbitrarily large as discount factor \(\rho\rightarrow1\). To mitigate such huge efficiency loss, we propose a novel selective information disclosure (SID) mechanism: we only reveal the latest traffic information to users when they intend to over-explore stochastic paths upon arrival, while hiding such information when they want to under-explore. We prove that our mechanism successfully reduces PoA to be less than~\(2\). Besides the parallel routing network, we further extend our mechanism and PoA results to any linear path graphs with multiple intermediate nodes.</description>

      <title>Beyond discounted returns: Robust Markov decision processes with average and Blackwell optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) are a widely used framework for sequential decision-making under parameter uncertainty. RMDPs have been extensively studied when the objective is to maximize the discounted return, but little is known for average optimality (optimizing the long-run average of the rewards obtained over time) and Blackwell optimality (remaining discount optimal for all discount factors sufficiently close to ). In this paper, we prove several foundational results for RMDPs beyond the discounted return. We show that average optimal policies can be chosen stationary and deterministic for sa-rectangular RMDPs but, perhaps surprisingly, we show that for s-rectangular RMDPs average optimal policies may not exist, and if they exist, may need to be history-dependent (Markovian). We also study Blackwell optimality for sa-rectangular RMDPs, where we show that $\epsilon$-Blackwell optimal policies always exist, although Blackwell optimal policies may not exist. We also provide a sufficient condition for their existence, which encompasses virtually any examples from the literature. We then discuss the connection between average and Blackwell optimality, and we describe several algorithms to compute the optimal average return. Interestingly, our approach leverages the connections between RMDPs and stochastic games. Overall, our paper emphasizes the superior practical properties of distance-based sa-rectangular models over s-rectangular models for average and Blackwell optimality.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>
