      <title>Coexistence of two contrasting recurrence properties of certain non-integrable cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recurrence properties of certain skew products over symmetric interval exchange transformations, including rotations, with cocycles of the form $f(x)=-\frac{1}{x^a}+\frac{1}{(1-x)^a}$, where $a&gt;1$. We prove that typically, such systems are dissipative. However, at the same time they are \emph{topologically recurrent}, i.e. for every open rectangle $A\subset[0,1)\times \R$, there exists an infinite sequence $(q_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $T^{q_n}_f(A)\cap A\neq\emptyset$.</description>

      <title>Topological transitivity of group cellular automata is decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological transitivity is a fundamental notion in topological dynamics and is widely regarded as a basic indicator of global dynamical complexity. For general cellular automata, topological transitivity is known to be undecidable. By contrast, positive decidability results have been established for one-dimensional group cellular automata over abelian groups, while the extension to higher dimensions and to non-abelian groups has remained an open problem. In this work, we settle this problem by proving that topological transitivity is decidable for the class of $d$-dimensional ($d\geq 1$) group cellular automata over arbitrary finite groups. Our approach combines a decomposition technique for group cellular automata, reducing the problem to the analysis of simpler components, with an extension of several results from the existing literature in the one-dimensional setting. As a consequence of our results, and exploiting known equivalences among dynamical properties for group cellular automata, we also obtain the decidability of several related notions, including total transitivity, topological mixing and weak mixing, weak and strong ergodic mixing, and ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal polynomials appear naturally in the study of compositions of M\"obius transformations. In this paper, we consider several classes of orthogonal polynomials associated to non-autonomous perturbations of a parabolic M\"obius map. Our results can be viewed as instances of non-autonomous parabolic implosion, including a random perturbative regime in which convergence holds almost surely.</description>

      <title>Fractals in rate-induced tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When parameters of a dynamical system change sufficiently fast, critical transitions can take place even in the absence of bifurcations. This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional H\'enon map, and a forced pendulum.</description>

      <title>Length spectrum rigidity and flexibility of spheres of revolution with one equator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of marked length spectrum for $S^1$-symmetric Riemannian metrics on the two-sphere having only one equator. We prove that isospectral metrics in this class have conjugate geodesic flows. Under a further $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry assumption, we show that the marked length spectrum determines the metric. Finally, we show that every isospectral class of metrics contains a unique $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric metric and give an explicit description of this isospectral class as an infinite dimensional convex set, generalizing the known description of $S^1$-symmetric Zoll metrics. This paper contains also two appendices, in which we provide an elementary proof of the fact that a $C^2$ real valued function on an interval is determined by the set of tangent lines to its graph, and we classify a class of $S^1$-invariant contact forms on three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Affine thickness: Patterns and a Gap Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new notion of thickness for subsets of $B[0,1]\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ called affine thickness is defined; this notion of thickness is a generalisation of Falconer-Yavicoli thickness and is adapted to be used in the study of certain sets with affine cut outs. Thick sets are proven to be winning for the matrix potential game introduced in (arXiv:2508.11577) and as an application we can prove that for a thick set, there exists $M\in\mathbb{N}$ depending on the thickness of the set, such that the set contains a homothetic copy of every finite set with at most $M$ elements. Additionally, the author provides a counter-example to the gap lemma in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) for Falconer-Yavicoli thickness, stated in (Math. Z., 2022) proving this result does not hold in the generality stated. We go on to provide a gap lemma for affine thickness in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (for $n\geq 2$) under additional conditions to the classical Newhouse gap lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that on a $\sigma$-finite measure preserving system $X = (X,\nu, T)$, the non-conventional ergodic averages $$ \mathbb{E}_{n \in [N]} \Lambda(n) f(T^n x) g(T^{P(n)} x)$$ converge pointwise almost everywhere for $f \in L^{p_1}(X)$, $g \in L^{p_2}(X)$, and $1/p_1 + 1/p_2 \leq 1$, where $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree at least $2$. This had previously been established with the von Mangoldt weight $\Lambda$ replaced by the constant weight $1$ by the first and third authors with Mirek, and by the M\"obius weight $\mu$ by the fourth author. The proof is based on combining tools from both of these papers, together with several Gowers norm and polynomial averaging operator estimates on approximants to the von Mangoldt function of ''Cram\'er'' and ''Heath-Brown'' type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question how a given connection structure (directed graph) can be realised as a heteroclinic network that is complete in the sense that it contains all unstable manifolds of its equilibria. For a directed graph consisting of two cycles we provide a constructive method to achieve this: (i) enlarge the graph by adding some edges and (ii) apply the simplex method to obtain a network in phase space. Depending on the length of the cycles we derive the minimal number of required new edges. In the resulting network each added edge leads to a positive transverse eigenvalue at the respective equilibrium. We discuss the total number of such positive eigenvalues in an individual cycle and some implications for the stability of this cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can be analyzed via their Frobenius-Perron transfer operator and its estimation from data is an active field of research. Recently entropic transfer operators have been introduced to estimate the operator of deterministic systems. The approach is based on the regularizing properties of entropic optimal transport plans. In this article we generalize the method to stochastic and non-stationary systems and give a quantitative convergence analysis of the empirical operator as the available samples increase. We introduce a way to extend the operator's eigenfunctions to previously unseen samples, such that they can be efficiently included into a spectral embedding. The practicality and numerical scalability of the method are demonstrated on a real-world fluid dynamics experiment.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we survey physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a theoretical, deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions (basins/neighbourhoods of equilibria) in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for topological and geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors: First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time. Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in ["The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows", K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions. Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a family of parametrized nonhomogeneous linear complex differential equations on $[1,\infty)$, depending on a complex parameter lying in the critical strip. We identify a "suitable" rigidity hypothesis under which a phenomenon of structural asymmetry is established: if two solutions with the same initial condition equal to $1$, corresponding respectively to the parameters $s$ and $1-\bar{s}$, are both bounded on $[1,+\infty)$, then $\Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a definition of thickness in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and obtain a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of finitely or countably many thick compact sets using a variant of Schmidt's game. As an application we prove that given any compact set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with thickness $\tau$, there is a number $N(\tau)$ such that the set contains a translate of all sufficiently small similar copies of every set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with at most $N(\tau)$ elements; indeed the set of such translations has positive Hausdorff dimension. We also prove a gap lemma and bounds relating Hausdorff dimension and thickness.</description>

      <title>The effect of timescale separation on the tipping window for chaotically forced systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tipping behavior can occur when an equilibrium of a dynamical system loses stability in response to a slowly varying parameter crossing a bifurcation threshold, or where noise drives a system from one attractor to another, or some combination of these effects. Similar behavior can be expected when a multistable system is forced by a chaotic deterministic system rather than by noise. In this context, the chaotic tipping window was recently introduced and investigated for discrete-time dynamics. In this paper, we find tipping windows for continuous-time nonlinear systems forced by chaos. We characterize the tipping window in terms of forcing by unstable periodic orbits of the chaos, and we show how the location and structure of this window depend on the relative timescales between the forcing and the responding system. We illustrate this by finding tipping windows for two examples of coupled bistable ODEs forced with chaos. Additionally, we describe the dynamic tipping window in the setting of a changing system parameter.</description>

      <title>SEIR models with host heterogeneity: theoretical aspects and applications to seasonal influenza dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population heterogeneity is a key factor in epidemic dynamics, influencing both transmission and final epidemic size. While heterogeneity is often modelled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR epidemic models, assuming that at the epidemic start there is no pre-existing immunity. Under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness, one obtains a closed system of 3 ODEs, which can be easily simulated and for which some analytical results are obtained. In particular, we proved that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $R_0$. We specialised in the case where susceptibility is distributed according to a gamma or extended Beta distribution, showing how the epidemic final size depends on the variance of the distribution. In the case of a gamma-distributed susceptibility, the resulting model consists of a system of ODEs with just one parameter more than the classical SEIR model; this makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by fitting data on seasonal influenza in Italy, and comparing the results to those obtained with simple SEIR models with pre-existing immunity.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Ginzburg-Landau equation correctly predicts the dynamics of quasilinear pattern-forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems, close to the first instability. We present a simple theorem which is easily applicable for such systems and relies on key maximal regularity results. The theorem is applied to the Gray-Scott-Klausmeier vegetation-water interaction model and its application to general reaction-diffusion-advection systems is discussed.</description>
