      <title>Radiative Semileptonic Decays of Beautiful Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive predictions for the hadronic matrix elements of radiative semileptonic decays of beautiful hadrons within Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), relevant for future measurements at Belle II and LHCb. Our study considers Lambda(b) -&gt; Lambda(c), Lambda(*)(c1) and B -&gt; D(*), D** transitions. The symmetries of HQET highly constrain the number of structure-dependent form factors in all cases. In the soft and sub-leading soft regions, all the form factors are fully determined in terms of non-radiative Isgur-Wise functions and the magnetic dipole moments of the heavy hadrons. The structure of higher order corrections is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermal Damping of Mass-Modulating Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological evolution of a scalar field is shaped by Hubble damping. Any non-gravitational couplings of the scalar with the primordial thermal bath generically contribute additional damping. Although rarely considered, such thermal damping could be the dominant dissipative effect. We derive approximate but highly general thermal-damping rates of scalar fields that modulate the masses of thermally populated particles. We extend previous results to cover cases of particular phenomenological interest where the scalar background oscillates sinusoidally but not necessarily slowly compared to the thermalization rates of the primordial bath. Based on these results, we estimate the thermal damping of scalars coupled to neutrinos linearly, to gluons quadratically, and to WIMPs linearly, and demonstrate its importance in certain parameter space of these models. We also estimate the thermal damping rates in models of QCD axion.</description>

      <title>CoLoRFulNNLO for hadron collisions: regularizing initial-state double real emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the extension of the completely local subtraction scheme CoLoRFulNNLO to color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We provide explicit momentum mappings and the complete set of double-real counterterms required for this class of processes. The counterterms are systematically derived from the known infrared limit formulae of QCD matrix elements, and particular care has been taken to ensure their analytic integrability. The resulting construction involves a relatively small number of counter-events, preserving the locality and efficiency of the scheme. All formulae have been implemented within the publicly available NNLOCAL Monte Carlo program, and we explicitly validate all IR limits using arbitrary-precision computer algebra and present representative results. The counterterms presented here constitute a self-contained subset applicable to general hadronic processes within the CoLoRFulNNLO approach.</description>

      <title>Jet Charge with Global Event Shapes: Probing Quark Flavor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose measuring the jet electric charge of jet regions, defined within the framework of global event shapes, as a probe of quark flavor dynamics within the nucleon and the hadronization process. In particular, we consider a measurement of the jet region charge while simultaneously keeping track of the energy flow throughout the event, as characterized by the global event shape. As a concrete example, we focus on the measurement of the 1-Jettiness jet charge ($Q$), the jet charge of the jet region ($J$) defined within the framework of the 1-Jettiness global event shape ($\tau_1$) for the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) process, $e^- + p \to e^- + J + X$, with unpolarized or longitudinally polarized protons. The 1-Jettiness distribution, binned according to jet charge, allows for enhanced quark flavor separation of the initial state unpolarized or polarized PDFs. On the other hand, the jet charge distribution binned by 1-Jettiness can serve as a probe of quark flavor dynamics in the final state hadronization process. We derive a factorization theorem for simultaneous measurements of $\tau_1$ and $Q$ in the resummation region, $\tau_1 \ll P_{J_T}$, where $P_{J_T}$ denotes the transverse momentum of the jet region. The factorization theorem contains a new universal charged jet function, generalizing the standard jet function to include a jet charge measurement. Therefore these universal functions can be extracted from a global analysis of N-jettiness and thrust at $e^+e^-$ colliders. We provide simulation studies to demonstrate the sensitivity of the 1-Jettiness jet charge observable to quark flavor dynamics in nucleon structure and explore the possibility of probing the final state hadronization process. This observable is well-suited for applications in existing HERA data and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Illuminating sequential freeze-in dark matter with dark photon signal at the CERN SHiP experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves observable footprints in dark matter direct detection, collider or fixed-target experiments, which can be altered in the two-field context. In this work, we consider sequential freeze-in dark matter through signals of dark photon mediator with a mass range of $m_{A'}\sim 10^{-2}-10$ GeV covered by the proposed SHiP experiment. We show that the dark charge is fixed to be $e'\sim 1.3\times 10^{-12}$ and the mixing parameter is restricted to $10^{-11}\leq \epsilon&lt; 10^{-8}-10^{-7.5}$, as a result of the out-of-equilibrium condition of dark photon and the observed relic abundance of dark matter. Within this $\epsilon$ region, the 5(15)-year data of proton bremsstrahlung process for the dark photon, assuming vector meson (dipole) dominance, excludes $\epsilon\geq 10^{-8.5} (10^{-7.9})$ at 90\% confidence level, implying only a narrow region of $\epsilon$ close to $\sim 10^{-11}$ left for alternative tests.</description>

Abstract: We study the radiative decays $D_{s1}(2460)\to\gamma D^{*}_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)\to \gamma D^0K^+/\gamma D^+K^0$ and argue that their simultaneous experimental measurement, or at least a constraint on the ratio of the corresponding branching fractions, can allow one to probe the nature of the $D^{*}_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses, $\delta_\mathrm{PMNS}$, and $m_{\beta\beta}$ in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the leptonic sector of a recently proposed supersymmetric SO(10) model with supersymmetry breaking in the 3-10 TeV range. A new ingredient in this work is the requirement that the observed baryon asymmetry is explained via non-thermal leptogenesis, which can be realized in a large class of supersymmetric hybrid inflation models including SO(10). We provide estimates for the masses of the three Standard Model neutrinos (with the lightest mass $m_1\approx 5$ meV) as well as the three right-handed neutrinos ($M_1\approx 10^9$ GeV and $M_{2,3}\approx 10^{13}$ GeV). The best fit estimate for the leptonic CP violating parameter $\delta_\mathrm{PMNS}\approx 235^\circ$, and the value of the neutrinoless double beta decay mass parameter $m_{\beta\beta}\approx 0.18$ meV. A numerical analysis broadens the predicted range for $\delta_\mathrm{PMNS}$ ($100^\circ$-$300^\circ$), but leaves largely intact the predictions for the six (light and heavy) neutrino masses and $m_{\beta \beta}$. Our statistical analysis, which yields the likelihood-predicted ranges of the observables, is fully consistent with JUNO's newly released first measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations in the $\Delta m^2_{12}$-$\sin^2\theta_{12}$ plane, with JUNO improving the precision by a factor of 1.6 relative to the combination of all previous measurements. The implementation of successful non-thermal leptogenesis allows us to provide estimates for the inflaton mass ($m_\chi \approx 7\times 10^{9}$ GeV) and the reheating temperature ($T_\mathrm{RH}\approx 4\times 10^6$ GeV).</description>

      <title>Gauge-independent treatment of electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first certificate of the gauge-independent bubble nucleation at the electroweak phase transition with the standard model effective field theory. Taking advantage of the thermal effective field theory framework, with the power counting $\lambda \sim g^3$, we rigorously demonstrate the gauge independence of the bubble nucleation rate up to two-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of relevant phase transition parameters on the gauge parameter and investigate its implications for gravitational waves generated by the electroweak phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The Dichotomous Nature of the $\sigma$ Meson and the Nucleon D-Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a symmetry-preserving contact-interaction formulation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we examine the identity of the $\sigma$ meson and its implications for the gravitational structure of hadrons. In this framework, the scalar meson emerges as the chiral partner of the pion, with both states' properties tightly connected to the mechanisms of mass generation in QCD. We find that, above a critical coupling that triggers dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, the D-terms of the constituent quark, the pion, and $\sigma$ saturate at fixed values $D_{q,\pi,\sigma}=-1/3,-1,-7/3$. By examining the coupling strength evolution of the D-terms, this pattern follows naturally once a dual nature for the $\sigma$ meson is recognized: it behaves both as a quark-antiquark composite and as a dilaton arising from spontaneous scale symmetry breaking. This unified picture yields the prediction $D_N\sim -3$ for the nucleon D-term, consistent with contemporary lattice-QCD, continuum, and dispersive studies.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of $B$, $B_s$ and $B_c$ meson semitauonic modes in potential quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the form factors and compute the branching fractions for the semitauonic decay modes, $B \to D^{(*)}\,\tau\,\nu_{\tau}$, $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\,\tau\,\nu_{\tau}$, $B_c \to \eta_c\,(J/\psi)\,\tau\,\nu_{\tau}$, and $B_c \to D^{(*)}\,\tau\,\nu_{\tau}$ within the \emph{Relativistic Independent Quark (RIQ) Model}, emphasizing a quark potential model based analysis of these transitions. We outline the essential elements of the model, incorporating corrections from residual interactions and center-of-mass motion, and perform a comprehensive study of the form factors across the full physical kinematic range of $q^2$. The resulting predictions demonstrate consistency and good agreement with existing theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. Motivated by recent observations of polarization observables at LHCb and Belle, we further evaluate these quantities within our framework and find results compatible with Standard Model (SM) expectations. The predictions presented here serve as theoretical input in decay channels for which Lattice QCD results remain limited, offering guidance for future experimental and Lattice efforts. Thus, semileptonic $B$ decays continue to serve as precise and discerning probes of the fundamental mechanisms governing flavor transitions in the SM.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological studies of exclusive heavy-quarkonium electroproduction at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the next-to-leading order (NLO) coefficient functions for exclusive electroproduction of heavy vector mesons derived in our previous work, we perform various phenomenological studies of exclusive electroproduction in $ep$ collisions relevant for both the existing measurements from HERA, and the forthcoming Electron-Ion collider (EIC). We compare our cross-section results to HERA data across a broad range of photon virtualities $Q^2$ and $\gamma^* p$ centre-of-mass energies, provide predictions for upcoming EIC measurements and conclude with a discussion on the necessity of resumming logarithmically enhanced contributions in $J/\psi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Majorana Dark Matter and Its Self-Interactions in a Gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an inelastic Majorana dark matter model gauged by $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, featuring a complex scalar and fermions with a small Dirac mass. The model exhibits strong interactions between the dark fermion-antifermion pair and the scalar, with a large coupling generating a Majorana mass after symmetry breaking. The dark fermion splits into two nearly degenerate Majorana eigenstates, with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson $Z^\prime$ interacting via inelastic axial vector currents. The lighter Majorana serves as dark matter (DM), while the heavier may also contribute. The model predicts DM masses ranging from about 10 GeV to hundreds of GeV, with the scalar favored below 100 MeV. Strong coupling causes DM particles to mainly annihilate into two scalars, which determines the relic abundance, while thermal equilibrium with the bath occurs through $Z^\prime$ interactions. Self-interacting DM particles scatter via ladder exchange of strongly coupled light scalars, helping resolve small-scale issues. The $Z^\prime$ interacts with the muon, affecting its magnetic moment and explaining the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy. Effects on experiments, $N_{\text{eff}}$, and the Hubble tension from kinetic mixing between $Z^\prime$ and the photon, originating from high-energy scales, are discussed. The model details and parameter constraints used in experiments are also covered.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Informed 3+1 Sterile Neutrino Global Fits using Posterior Density Estimation of Electron Disappearance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global analyses of particle physics data are integral for validating and scrutinizing published results of experiments. Global fits of anomalous oscillation data which search for one or more eV-scale sterile neutrinos are particularly challenging both to evaluate and to reconcile in the global picture. Fits (especially joint ones) to oscillation data suffer from significant computational burdens, such as likelihood intractability, making traditional Markov Chain-Monte Carlo all but impossible. Given evidence both supporting and challenging beyond Standard Model physics across neutrino experiments of various baselines, energies, and detection techniques, the global search for sterile neutrinos requires additional tools in order to determine whether sterile neutrinos remain a viable solution to unexplained anomalies. Furthermore, both a Bayesian and frequentist interpretation of sterile neutrino data is needed for a complete assessment of longstanding tensions in the field. Techniques from the machine learning subfield of simulation-based inference have a natural application to such a problem. In this contribution, we illustrate some of the outstanding questions of the global picture of light sterile neutrinos by focusing on experiments searching with the disappearance of electron (anti)neutrinos, and look to posterior density estimation strategies to craft answers, including comparisons to a machine-learning-based frequentist approach.</description>

      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the calculation of the inclusive jet function for highly energetic heavy quarks at order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ using boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). This jet function describes the effect of collinear radiation emitted by energetic heavy quarks on observables dependent on the jet invariant mass $M$. In particular, we focus on the regime $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, which is relevant for boosted top quark production at high-energy colliders in the resonance region. Our results are consistent with non-Abelian exponentiation and reproduce the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions up to three loops. We also verify that the $n_\ell^2 \alpha_s^3$ contribution, with $n_\ell$ denoting the number of light quark flavors, agrees with predictions from renormalon calculus. This calculation completes the list of ingredients required for the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution, an essential component for calibrating the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. It likewise contributes to the invariant-mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks, enabling precise mass determinations at future lepton colliders. Finally, we determine the relation between the pole and two short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ and provide an estimate of the non-logarithmic part of the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <title>Dark matter implications from the XENONnT and LZ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05850</link>

Abstract: We investigate a possible dark matter origin of the high-energy nuclear-recoil excess reported by recent liquid xenon experiments, including \textnormal{XENONnT} and \textnormal{LZ}, which cannot be explained by standard elastic spin-independent WIMP scattering. Using our unified \texttt{DIAMX} framework, built on openly available data and likelihood models, we perform the first combined profile-likelihood fits to multiple WIMP-search datasets with a total exposure of 7.3~tonne $\times$ year. We investigate that two broad classes of dark matter nucleon interactions, with velocity-dependent cross-section or inelastic (endo- and exothermic) scattering, can reproduce the observed high-energy recoil spectrum, reaching local significances up to $4\sigma$. We further quantify the impact of $^{124}$Xe double electron capture (DEC) backgrounds, finding that variations in the poorly known DEC charge yields can shift the inferred significances from below $1\sigma$ to $4\sigma$. We point out that extending the same analysis to \textnormal{XENONnT} and \textnormal{LZ} data with recoil energies up to 300\,keV, once available, will provide a powerful test of the dark matter interpretation, since the $^{124}$Xe DEC background is expected to be negligible in this high-energy range.</description>

      <title>Dijet bounds on third-generation four-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use dijet measurements from the Large Hadron Collider to constrain ten third-generation four-quark operators in the Standard Model effective field theory. At tree level, only the five operators involving four bottom quarks are directly constrained, but renormalization group (RG) effects allow all ten operators to be probed. Our analysis includes the dominant leading-logarithmic RG contributions up to two-loop order. The resulting bounds for the first five operators are nominal stronger or comparable to current limits, while those for the remaining operators remain weak despite the inclusion of logarithmically enhanced corrections.</description>

      <title>Untangling the IBP Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an algorithm for the diagonalization of the Integration-by-Parts (IBP) equations. Diagonalized IBP equations are indispensable for reducing loop integrals with high numerator powers to master integrals and for solving IBP identities in closed analytic form. A prime example is provided by multivariate Mellin representations of loop amplitudes and cross sections. The extension of these methods to other multivariate recurrence relations is also discussed. As a by-product of our diagonalization procedure, we show how the IBP equations can be cast into an efficient, fully triangular form that is well suited for computer implementation. Several complicated topologies have been computed.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Quantum Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions originating from vacuum fluctuations of mediator fields. Such forces inevitably arise between ordinary matter particles whenever they couple to light mediator species. Conventional computations of quantum forces rely on evaluating one-loop Feynman diagrams of the relevant scattering processes. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to compute quantum forces. Instead of relying on perturbative scattering amplitudes, we directly evaluate the quantum fluctuations of the mediator field by solving its quantized equation of motion with appropriate boundary conditions. This approach remains valid beyond the Born approximation and thus applies to regimes of strong coupling between the mediator and matter fields. In the weak-coupling limit, our results reproduce the known expressions from the Feynman diagram approach. In the strong-coupling regime, the result is modified by a factor that can suppress or enhance the effect. In contrast to classical forces, quantum forces intrinsically violate the superposition principle. Our approach may therefore offer a useful tool for probing non-perturbative effects in the infrared regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been realised that strings with time-dependent tensions exhibit interesting dynamics; in particular, when the tension decreases loops of string can grow and possibly percolate. We extend previous analytic studies of strings with time-dependent tensions to numerical studies of non-circular loops. We show that the dynamics of a varying-tension string in expanding universe is mathematically equivalent to the evolution of a fixed-tension string in a universe with a modified scale factor. We use numerical solvers and machine learning techniques to explore the dynamics of non-circular string loops with radii close to the Hubble scale.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (IV) CMB Spectral and Anisotropy Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are macroscopic dark-matter candidates, with masses of the order of a few grams to a kilogram and sub-micron radius, thought to form at the Quantum Chromo Dynamic era through axion-induced charge separation. This framework naturally links the dark and visible matter abundances ($\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry where dark matter is composed of matter AQNs and antimatter AQNs. Although behaving as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, baryons annihilate with antimatter AQNs, producing ionizing high-energy photons. The resulting energy injection may imprint spectral distortions on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and modify the reionization history. Using a modified version of the \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code we compute the impact of this energy injection on the $\mu$ and $y$ spectral distortion parameters as well as on the optical depth. We find that (1) the CMB anisotropies remain essentially unaffected by baryon annihilation, and (2) the associated spectral distortion signatures lie within the sensitivity reach of proposed CMB spectral distortion missions. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences between the AQN scenario and annihilating or decaying dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Emissions from the Microquasar V4641 Sgr, SS433, and its implications in the Diffuse Galactic Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microquasars (MQs) are Galactic binary systems, consisting of a star and a compact object, a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole, which accretes matter from its companion star and gives rise to relativistic jets. Recent detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{GeV}$) and ultra-high-energy (UHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{TeV}$) gamma-rays by LHAASO, HAWC and HESS from the MQ V4641 Sgr and SS 433 suggests them as Galactic PeVatrons. In this work, we studied a hadronic origin of the observed TeV-PeV gamma-ray emission from these MQs. We considered the hadronic scenario where the gamma-rays are produced by the interaction of relativistic protons in the MQ jet with the stellar wind. We fitted our model with observed data and constrained physical parameters like the hadronic jet power fraction, the proton spectral index, the maximum proton energy and the jet bulk Lorentz factor. Our best-fit model shows hard proton spectra ($1.84-2.44$) and maximum proton energies between 1 and 5 PeV. We also estimated the all-flavor neutrino fluxes corresponding to the gamma-ray fluxes from the hadronic model and found that V4641 sgr can be detected by next-generation neutrino telescopes like KM3NeT-ARCA and TRIDENT. Furthermore, we modeled a synthetic population of Galactic MQs and estimated their contribution to the diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray flux. For the inner Galaxy PSR contribution dominates in the range 10-100 TeV, and above 100 TeV diffused cosmic ray interactions with the molecular clouds is most dominant. We find that a population $\sim 14$ MQs is required to explain the LHAASO data above 100 TeV. For the outer Galaxy, we show that MQs are the dominant class of sources, and we constrain their population $\sim$14. Our findings strongly suggest that MQs are efficient particle accelerators, contributing to Galactic PeVatrons and potential multimessenger sources in our Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that Feynman integral reduction is controlled by solutions of the Landau equations. We study integral relations with prescribed propagator powers using syzygy methods and discuss how syzygies can be expressed as a sum over components of the Landau singularity locus. This leads to a determinantal approach to solving the syzygy problem, giving rise to highly compact and physically transparent solutions. We demonstrate the method in applications to planar two-loop five-point integrals relevant for the $pp \rightarrow t\overline{t}H$ process. Our results suggest an efficient method of Feynman integral reduction and provide a novel physical perspective on the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is expected to accumulate inside neutron stars, modifying the structure of isolated stars and influencing both the dynamics of binary mergers and the evolution of the resulting hypermassive remnants. Since differential rotation is the primary mechanism delaying the collapse of these remnants, understanding its behavior is crucial when assessing the impact of an embedded dark component. In this work, we extend the numerical code RNS to describe two gravitationally coupled fluids in differential rotation, with baryonic matter modeled by a realistic nuclear equation of state and dark matter represented as a self-interacting bosonic condensate. Within this framework, we construct equilibrium sequences for a representative differential rotation law, providing a basis to explore how dark matter may influence the global properties and rotational dynamics of binary neutron star remnants.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass relation from a standard-model boson operator representation in terms of fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard-model can be equivalently represented with its fields in a spin-extended basis, departing from fermion degrees of freedom. The common Higgs operator connects the electroweak and Yukawa sectors, restricting the top and bottom quark masses[Phys. Rev. D 99, 073001, 2019]. Using second quantization, within the heavy-particle sector, electroweak vectors, the Higgs field, and symmetry operators are expanded in terms of bilinear combinations of top and bottom quark operators, considering discrete degrees of freedom and chirality. This is interpreted as either a basis choice or as a description of composite models. The vacuum expectation value is calculated quantum mechanically, which relates to the common mass-generating scalar operator and it reproduces the vector and quark-doublet masses. This also links the corresponding scalar-vector and Yukawa vertices, and restricts the t- and b-quark masses in a hierarchy relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new solution to the Higgs hierarchy problem based on dynamical vacuum selection in a landscape scanning the Higgs mass. In patches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs potential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This causes a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape. Conversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a critical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the standard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the instability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its running. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass hinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study two simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in the singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system. We show that the relevant parts of their parameter spaces can be probed by proposed future colliders, such as the FCC-ee or a muon collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Top quark interactions offer a window into possible new high scale physics and many models of new physics predict that the top quark interactions will deviate significantly from those predicted by the Standard Model (SM). We present an analysis of the experimental restrictions on anomalous 4-fermion $e^+e^- t {\overline{t}}$ operators that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in both the electroweak and QCD interactions within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework. At NLO, there is sensitivity to an extended set of anomalous interactions beyond those probed at leading order. A comparison of current limits from electroweak precision observables, along with expected future limits from Drell-Yan and $t{\overline{t}}e^+e^-$ production at the high luminosity LHC, from deep inelastic scattering at the EIC, and from projected sensitivities at the future FCC-ee and CEPC machines demonstrates that each of these programs extends the precision understanding of the interactions of top quarks.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Einstein-Dilaton Model for Pure Yang-Mills Thermodynamics and Glueball Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning assisted holographic model that consistently describes both the equation of state and glueball spectrum of pure Yang-Mills theory, achieved through neural network reconstruction of Einstein-dilaton gravity. Our framework incorporates key non-perturbative constraints of lattice QCD data: the ground ($0^{++}$) and first-excited ($0^{++*}$) scalar glueball masses pins down the infrared (IR) geometry, while entropy density data anchors the ultraviolet (UV) behavior of the metric. A multi-stage neural network optimization then yields the full gravitational dual -- warp factor $A(z)$ and dilaton field $\Phi(z)$ -- that satisfies both spectroscopic and thermodynamic constraints. The resulting model accurately reproduces the deconfinement phase transition thermodynamics (pressure, energy density, trace anomaly) and predicts higher glueball excitations ($0^{++**}$, $0^{++***}$) consistent with available lattice calculations. This work establishes a new paradigm for data-driven holographic reconstruction, solving the long-standing challenge of unified description of confinement thermodynamics and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Investigating jet induced identified hadron productions from the relative transverse activity classifier in pp collision at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the jet associated identified hadron productions of pions, kaons, and protons based on the event topological separation method in proton proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV employing the AMPT model with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. Enabling relative transverse event activity classifier $R_T$, we analyze the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra and particle ratios in the jet aligned toward region and the underlying event (UE) contributions sensitive transverse region varying with $R_T$. The results indicate that the AMPT model, incorporating both partonic and hadronic final-state interactions, provides a satisfactory description to the experimental data of the $p_T$ differential yields, particle ratios and average transverse momentum of identified particles in both the toward and transverse regions across different event activity classes. By subtracting the UE contribution from the toward region using the transverse region hadron yield, we introduce the in-jet hadron productions to analyze the modifications to jet itself. We find that the in-jet baryon to meson ratios reveal a sensitive dependence on $R_T$ driven by final state interactions, leading to a unique crossing pattern at intermediate $p_T$. This behavior can be regarded as a novel signature for probing jet medium interactions and energy loss effects in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Chirality structure of vector like new physics operators in charged current transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cascade decay $B^{*0}_{s} \rightarrow D_s^-(\rightarrow \tau^-\,\bar\nu_{\tau})\,\ell^{+}\,{\nu}_\ell$ induced by flavor changing charged currents in the context of the Standard Model and in vector-like couplings beyond the Standard Model. We employ the helicity amplitude formalism for analysis and highlight the role of new vector-like couplings in charged current interactions. We find, in particular, that while new left handed chiral-vector like interactions contribute to the branching ratio, they do not affect the forward-backward asymmetry, or the angular observables. On the other hand, the right handed chiral vector-like coupling in the case of this decay contributes to the branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry and the angular observables. We confirm that this difference in behavior between the left and right handed NP couplings is a general feature of charged current processes with a vector meson going to a pseudoscalar at the tree level in effective weak theory by cross checking with the cascade decays $B^{*+}_c \rightarrow P(\rightarrow P'\,\mu^+\,\nu_{\mu})\,\ell^{+}\,{\nu}_\ell$ where $P$ is $B_s^0$ ($D^0$) and $P'$ is $D_s^{*-}$ ($K^-$).</description>

      <title>A Limit on the Total Lepton Number in the Universe from BBN and the CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At temperatures below the QCD phase transition, any substantial lepton number in the Universe can only be present within the neutrino sector. In this work, we systematically explore the impact of a non-vanishing lepton number on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Relying on our recently developed framework based on momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations for the neutrino density matrix, we solve the full BBN reaction network to obtain the abundances of primordial elements. We find that the maximal primordial total lepton number $L$ allowed by BBN and the CMB is $-0.12 \,(-0.10) \leq L \leq 0.13\,(0.12) $ for NH (IH), while specific flavor directions can be even more constrained. This bound is complementary to the limits obtained from avoiding baryon overproduction through sphaleron processes at the electroweak phase transition since, although numerically weaker, it applies at lower temperatures and is obtained completely independently. We publicly release the C++ code COFLASY-C on GitHub which solves for the evolution of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations numerically.</description>

      <title>Seasons of Dark Matter Freeze-In Shaped by the Weather of the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the imprints of freeze-in dark matter (DM) on cosmological structures requires knowledge of its phase-space distribution. We investigate how variations in the cosmological history before nucleosynthesis, the "weather" of that epoch, give rise to distinct "seasons" in the DM momentum distribution that govern its warmness. Studying decay-driven production across diverse cosmological histories, we map how these conditions shape DM phase-space properties. Our study quantifies how the early universe composition plays a key role in determining the mass bound on freeze-in DM.</description>

      <title>Exploring enhanced non-resonant di-Higgs production at the HL-LHC with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate di-Higgs production in the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ final state at the LHC, focusing on scenarios where the gluon fusion process is enhanced by new colored scalars, which could be identified as squarks or leptoquarks. We consider two benchmarks characterized by the mass of the lightest colored scalar, BM$_{\mathrm{L}}$ and BM$_{\mathrm{H}}$, corresponding to 464 GeV and 621 GeV, respectively. Using Monte Carlo simulations for both the signal and the dominant backgrounds, we perform a discovery analysis with deep neural networks, exploring various architectures and input variables. Our results show that the discrimination power is maximized by employing two dedicated classifiers, one trained against QCD backgrounds and another against backgrounds involving single-Higgs processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that including high-level features -- such as the invariant masses $m_{\gamma\gamma}$, $m_{bb}$, and $m_{hh}$, as well as the transverse momenta and angular separations of the photon and $b$-jet pairs -- significantly improves the performance compared to using only low-level features as the invariant mass and momenta of the final particles. For the latter case, we find that architectures processing photon and $b$-jet variables separately can enhance the significance for BM$_{\mathrm{H}}$. Projecting for an integrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$, we obtain a significance of 7.3 for BM$_{\mathrm{L}}$, while it drops to 3.1 for BM$_{\mathrm{H}}$. In the particular case of BM$_{\mathrm{L}}$, discovery level significance can be reached at 1.7 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics provides a rigorous framework within which processes mediated by electroweak interactions can be calculated with great accuracy. By comparing with high-precision experimental measurements of the same processes, deviations from Standard Model predictions can be identified as indirect signals of new physics. In particular, electroweak precision fits combine multiple observables and provide a unique test of the Standard Model consistency at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Search for Ultralight Dark Matter with Quantum Magnetometry in the Earth's Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axions and dark photons, are leading dark matter candidates. They may couple feebly to photons, sourcing oscillating electromagnetic signals in the Earth's conducting cavity formed between the ground and the ionosphere, providing detectable magnetic field signatures at wavelengths above the Earth's size. We carry out a project aiming to search for new physics using an unshielded high-sensitivity atomic magnetometer, termed the Geomagnetic Probe for nEw physiCS (GPEX). In this work, we report our first search for axion and dark photon dark matter, conducted in the desert of XiaoDushan in Gansu Province, China. Analysis of the collection of one-hour data shows no robust evidence for axion- or dark photon-induced magnetic signals. Correspondingly, we set the constraints on the axion-photon coupling with $g_{a\gamma\gamma} &lt; 7\times10^{-10}\, \mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ and the dark photon kinetic-mixing parameter $\epsilon &lt; 2\times10^{-6}$ in the mass range $3.5 \times 10^{-16}\, \mathrm{eV} \sim 1.8 \times 10^{-14}\, \mathrm{eV}$. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ground-based quantum magnetic sensors for ultralight dark matter searches. Future networks of such detectors operating over extended periods could improve the sensitivity by about three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Complete one-loop QED corrections to $D_s^+$ leptonic decays and impact on the CKM unitarity test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a violation of the CKM unitarity condition has been reported in the latest charm-meson data and the latest lattice results, once the universal electroweak correction is taken into account. In this article, we analytically derive for the first time the complete one-loop electroweak (EW) and QED corrections to the $D_{s}^+ \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ decays for $\ell = \mu, \tau$. Our analysis incorporates both short-distance EW-QED corrections, which are beyond the leading-logarithmic approximation (the so-called Sirlin factor), and long-distance soft-photon corrections depending on the maximum total energy of undetected photons with their resummation. Although the inclusive photon QED corrections to the meson leptonic decays are well known, they do not match the actual measurement circumstances in $D_s^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_\mu$. We find $ |V_{cs}|_{D_s} = 0.991 \pm 0.007 $ from the latest data on $D_s^+$ leptonic decays. We show that properly including these radiative corrections is essential to bring the second-column CKM unitarity tests into agreement with the Standard Model expectation. The study emphasizes that the current limiting factor in confirming CKM unitarity is the precision of QED corrections, and it points out that improving lattice simulations, taking the QED corrections into account, would be desirable for a more robust confirmation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Physics case for low-$\sqrt{s}$ QCD studies at FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of hadronic final states in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at centre-of-mass (CM) energies below the Z peak can notably extend the FCC-ee physics reach in terms of precision quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies. Hadronic final states can be studied over a range of hadronic energies $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{had}} \approx 20\mbox{--}80\,\mathrm{GeV}$ by exploiting events with hard initial- and final-state QED radiation (ISR/FSR) during the high-luminosity Z-pole run, as well as in dedicated short (about one month long) $e^{+}e^{-}$ runs at CM energies $\sqrt{s} \approx 40\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $60\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Using realistic estimates and fast detector simulations, we show that data samples of about $10^{9}$ hadronic events can be collected at the FCC-ee at each of the low-CM-energy points. Such datasets can be exploited in a variety of precision QCD measurements, including studies of light-, heavy-quark and gluon jet properties, hadronic event shapes, fragmentation functions, and nonperturbative dynamics. This will offer valuable insights into strong interaction physics, complementing data from nominal FCC-ee runs at higher center-of-mass energies, $\sqrt{s} \approx 91, 160, 240,$ and $365\,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Rapidity spectra in high-energy collisions and longitudinal nuclear suppression from nonadditive statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the longitudinal nuclear suppression factor defined by a scaled ratio of rapidity distributions. To study this experimental observable, we describe three approaches involving numerical and analytical calculations. We first approach this problem by conducting model studies using EPOS, FTFP$_{BERT}$, and HIJING, and notice that while EPOS shows a decreasing trend of this ratio at forward/backward rapidities, the latter two model calculations display an increment of the ratio. The analytical approaches involve, first, the quasi-exponential distribution obtained from the Tsallis statistics, and second, the nonadditive Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation. We notice that our analytical results satisfactorily describe NA61 experimental data (for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV) for the negatively charged pions.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), particularly around the knee region ($\sim$3 PeV), remains a major unsolved question. Recent observations by LHAAASO suggest that the knee is shaped mainly by protons, with a transition to heavier elements at higher energies. Microquasars -- compact jet-emitting sources -- have emerged as possible PeV CR accelerators, especially after detections of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays from these systems. We propose that the observed proton spectrum (hard below a few PeV, steep beyond) arises from the reacceleration of sub-TeV Galactic CRs via shear acceleration in large-scale microquasar jet-cocoon structures. Our model also naturally explains the observed spectrum of energies around a few tens of PeV by summing up heavier nuclei contributions. Additionally, similar reacceleration processes in radio galaxies can contribute to ultrahigh-energy CRs, bridging Galactic and extragalactic origins. Combined with low-energy CRs from supernova remnants and galaxy clusters around the second knee region, this scenario could provide a unified explanation for CRs across the entire energy spectrum.</description>

Abstract: The current status of the experimental investigation of quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions as probes for deconfinement is reviewed. The emphasis is put on the qualitative understanding of charmonia (ccbar bound states) and bottomonia (bbbar) based on the results in the past few years. In particular, the observation of non-primordial J/psi (ccbar) production as signature of deconfinement based on different observables and the sequential suppression patterns of the Upsilon (bbbar) states are discussed. An outlook focusing on the time scale until the next quark matter conference is provided.</description>

Abstract: We construct the planar integrand of the six-leg amplitude of massive W-bosons on the special Coulomb branch of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to two-loop order. We use the six-dimensional supersymmetric spinor-helicity formalism and the generalized unitarity-cut sewing technique to perform this analysis. The thus-found expression corresponds in the massless limit to the six-gluon maximally helicity-violating amplitude. The upshot of the current consideration is that the former is just an uplift of the latter from four to six dimensions. This repeats the pattern found earlier for four- and five-leg amplitudes of massive W-bosons.</description>

      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>
