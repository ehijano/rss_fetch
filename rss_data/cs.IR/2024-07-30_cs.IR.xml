      <title>Advancements in Recommender Systems: A Comprehensive Analysis Based on Data, Algorithms, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 286 research papers collected from Web of Science, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, arXiv, and Google Scholar databases, a systematic review methodology was adopted to review and summarize the current challenges and potential future developments in data, algorithms, and evaluation aspects of RSs. It was found that RSs involve five major research topics, namely algorithmic improvement, domain applications, user behavior &amp; cognition, data processing &amp; modeling, and social impact &amp; ethics. Collaborative filtering and hybrid recommendation techniques are mainstream. The performance of RSs is jointly limited by four types of eight data issues, two types of twelve algorithmic issues, and two evaluation issues. Notably, data-related issues such as cold start, data sparsity, and data poisoning, algorithmic issues like interest drift, device-cloud collaboration, non-causal driven, and multitask conflicts, along with evaluation issues such as offline data leakage and multi-objective balancing, have prominent impacts. Fusing physiological signals for multimodal modeling, defending against data poisoning through user information behavior, evaluating generative recommendations via social experiments, fine-tuning pre-trained large models to schedule device-cloud resource, enhancing causal inference with deep reinforcement learning, training multi-task models based on probability distributions, using cross-temporal dataset partitioning, and evaluating recommendation objectives across the full lifecycle are feasible solutions to address the aforementioned prominent challenges and unlock the power and value of RSs.The collected literature is mainly based on major international databases, and future research will further expand upon it.</description>

      <title>LitSearch: A Retrieval Benchmark for Scientific Literature Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Literature search questions, such as "where can I find research on the evaluation of consistency in generated summaries?" pose significant challenges for modern search engines and retrieval systems. These questions often require a deep understanding of research concepts and the ability to reason over entire articles. In this work, we introduce LitSearch, a retrieval benchmark comprising 597 realistic literature search queries about recent ML and NLP papers. LitSearch is constructed using a combination of (1) questions generated by GPT-4 based on paragraphs containing inline citations from research papers and (2) questions about recently published papers, manually written by their authors. All LitSearch questions were manually examined or edited by experts to ensure high quality. We extensively benchmark state-of-the-art retrieval models and also evaluate two LLM-based reranking pipelines. We find a significant performance gap between BM25 and state-of-the-art dense retrievers, with a 24.8% difference in absolute recall@5. The LLM-based reranking strategies further improve the best-performing dense retriever by 4.4%. Additionally, commercial search engines and research tools like Google Search perform poorly on LitSearch, lagging behind the best dense retriever by 32 points. Taken together, these results show that LitSearch is an informative new testbed for retrieval systems while catering to a real-world use case.</description>

      <title>MaTrRec: Uniting Mamba and Transformer for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aim to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing dynamic preferences and dependencies within user behavior sequences. Recently, Transformer models can effectively capture user preferences. However, their quadratic computational complexity limits recommendation performance on long interaction sequence data. Inspired by the State Space Model (SSM)representative model, Mamba, which efficiently captures user preferences in long interaction sequences with linear complexity, we find that Mamba's recommendation effectiveness is limited in short interaction sequences, with failing to recall items of actual interest to users and exacerbating the data sparsity cold start problem. To address this issue, we innovatively propose a new model, MaTrRec, which combines the strengths of Mamba and Transformer. This model fully leverages Mamba's advantages in handling long-term dependencies and Transformer's global attention advantages in short-term dependencies, thereby enhances predictive capabilities on both long and short interaction sequence datasets while balancing model efficiency. Notably, our model significantly improves the data sparsity cold start problem, with an improvement of up to 33% on the highly sparse Amazon Musical Instruments dataset. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on five widely used public datasets. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models on all five datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Unintelligentmumu/MaTrRec.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Taobao Display Advertising with Multimodal Representations: Challenges, Approaches and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recognized potential of multimodal data to improve model accuracy, many large-scale industrial recommendation systems, including Taobao display advertising system, predominantly depend on sparse ID features in their models. In this work, we explore approaches to leverage multimodal data to enhance the recommendation accuracy. We start from identifying the key challenges in adopting multimodal data in a manner that is both effective and cost-efficient for industrial systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a two-phase framework, including: 1) the pre-training of multimodal representations to capture semantic similarity, and 2) the integration of these representations with existing ID-based models. Furthermore, we detail the architecture of our production system, which is designed to facilitate the deployment of multimodal representations. Since the integration of multimodal representations in mid-2023, we have observed significant performance improvements in Taobao display advertising system. We believe that the insights we have gathered will serve as a valuable resource for practitioners seeking to leverage multimodal data in their systems.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Triplet Importance for Personalized Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized item ranking has been a crucial component contributing to the performance of recommender systems. As a representative approach, pairwise ranking directly optimizes the ranking with user implicit feedback by constructing (\textit{user}, \textit{positive item}, \textit{negative item}) triplets. Several recent works have noticed that treating all triplets equally may hardly achieve the best effects. They assign different importance scores to negative items, user-item pairs, or triplets, respectively. However, almost all the generated importance scores are groundless and hard to interpret, thus far from trustworthy and transparent. To tackle these, we propose the \textit{Triplet Shapley} -- a Shapely value-based method to measure the triplet importance in an interpretable manner. Due to the huge number of triplets, we transform the original Shapley value calculation to the Monte Carlo (MC) approximation, where the guarantee for the approximation unbiasedness is also provided. To stabilize the MC approximation, we adopt a control covariates-based method. Finally, we utilize the triplet Shapley value to guide the resampling of important triplets for benefiting the model learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public datasets involving classical matrix factorization- and graph neural network-based recommendation models. Empirical results and subsequent analysis show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CTR Prediction through Sequential Recommendation Pre-training: Introducing the SRP4CTR Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding user interests is crucial for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction tasks. In sequential recommendation, pre-training from user historical behaviors through self-supervised learning can better comprehend user dynamic preferences, presenting the potential for direct integration with CTR tasks. Previous methods have integrated pre-trained models into downstream tasks with the sole purpose of extracting semantic information or well-represented user features, which are then incorporated as new features. However, these approaches tend to ignore the additional inference costs to the downstream tasks, and they do not consider how to transfer the effective information from the pre-trained models for specific estimated items in CTR prediction. In this paper, we propose a Sequential Recommendation Pre-training framework for CTR prediction (SRP4CTR) to tackle the above problems. Initially, we discuss the impact of introducing pre-trained models on inference costs. Subsequently, we introduced a pre-trained method to encode sequence side information concurrently.During the fine-tuning process, we incorporate a cross-attention block to establish a bridge between estimated items and the pre-trained model at a low cost. Moreover, we develop a querying transformer technique to facilitate the knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model to industrial CTR models. Offline and online experiments show that our method outperforms previous baseline models.</description>

      <title>GradCraft: Elevating Multi-task Recommendations through Holistic Gradient Crafting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems require the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives to accurately model user interests, necessitating the application of multi-task learning methods. However, existing multi-task learning methods in recommendations overlook the specific characteristics of recommendation scenarios, falling short in achieving proper gradient balance. To address this challenge, we set the target of multi-task learning as attaining the appropriate magnitude balance and the global direction balance, and propose an innovative methodology named GradCraft in response. GradCraft dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes to align with the maximum gradient norm, mitigating interference from gradient magnitudes for subsequent manipulation. It then employs projections to eliminate gradient conflicts in directions while considering all conflicting tasks simultaneously, theoretically guaranteeing the global resolution of direction conflicts. GradCraft ensures the concurrent achievement of appropriate magnitude balance and global direction balance, aligning with the inherent characteristics of recommendation scenarios. Both offline and online experiments attest to the efficacy of GradCraft in enhancing multi-task performance in recommendations. The source code for GradCraft can be accessed at https://github.com/baiyimeng/GradCraft.</description>

      <title>High-Order Fusion Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in the field of recommender systems. Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals. Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques. Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges: i) Data augmentation (e.g., discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality. ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals. However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a High-Order Fusion Graph Contrastive Learning (HFGCL) framework for recommendation. Specifically, we discards the data augmentations and instead high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views. Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective. By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Utilization of Cross-scenario Information for Multi-scenario Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender system of the e-commerce platform usually serves multiple business scenarios. Multi-scenario Recommendation (MSR) is an important topic that improves ranking performance by leveraging information from different scenarios. Recent methods for MSR mostly construct scenario shared or specific modules to model commonalities and differences among scenarios. However, when the amount of data among scenarios is skewed or data in some scenarios is extremely sparse, it is difficult to learn scenario-specific parameters well. Besides, simple sharing of information from other scenarios may result in a negative transfer. In this paper, we propose a unified model named Cross-Scenario Information Interaction (CSII) to serve all scenarios by a mixture of scenario-dominated experts. Specifically, we propose a novel method to select highly transferable features in data instances. Then, we propose an attention-based aggregator module, which can adaptively extract relative knowledge from cross-scenario. Experiments on the production dataset verify the superiority of our method. Online A/B test in Meituan Waimai APP also shows a significant performance gain, leading to an average improvement in GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) of 1.0% for overall scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generative Retrieval with Preference Optimization for E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval introduces a groundbreaking paradigm to document retrieval by directly generating the identifier of a pertinent document in response to a specific query. This paradigm has demonstrated considerable benefits and potential, particularly in representation and generalization capabilities, within the context of large language models. However, it faces significant challenges in E-commerce search scenarios, including the complexity of generating detailed item titles from brief queries, the presence of noise in item titles with weak language order, issues with long-tail queries, and the interpretability of results. To address these challenges, we have developed an innovative framework for E-commerce search, called generative retrieval with preference optimization. This framework is designed to effectively learn and align an autoregressive model with target data, subsequently generating the final item through constraint-based beam search. By employing multi-span identifiers to represent raw item titles and transforming the task of generating titles from queries into the task of generating multi-span identifiers from queries, we aim to simplify the generation process. The framework further aligns with human preferences using click data and employs a constrained search method to identify key spans for retrieving the final item, thereby enhancing result interpretability. Our extensive experiments show that this framework achieves competitive performance on a real-world dataset, and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness in improving conversion gains.</description>

      <title>AOTree: Aspect Order Tree-based Model for Explainable Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent recommender systems aim to provide not only accurate recommendations but also explanations that help users understand them better. However, most existing explainable recommendations only consider the importance of content in reviews, such as words or aspects, and ignore the ordering relationship among them. This oversight neglects crucial ordering dimensions in the human decision-making process, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Aspect Order Tree-based (AOTree) explainable recommendation method, inspired by the Order Effects Theory from cognitive and decision psychology, in order to capture the dependency relationships among decisive factors. We first validate the theory in the recommendation scenario by analyzing the reviews of the users. Then, according to the theory, the proposed AOTree expands the construction of the decision tree to capture aspect orders in users' decision-making processes, and use attention mechanisms to make predictions based on the aspect orders. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness on rating predictions, and our approach aligns more consistently with the user' s decision-making process by displaying explanations in a particular order, thereby enhancing interpretability.</description>

      <title>FiCo-ITR: bridging fine-grained and coarse-grained image-text retrieval for comparative performance analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Image-Text Retrieval (ITR), recent advancements have leveraged large-scale Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) for Fine-Grained (FG) instance-level retrieval, achieving high accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity. For Coarse-Grained (CG) category-level retrieval, prominent approaches employ Cross-Modal Hashing (CMH) to prioritise efficiency, albeit at the cost of retrieval performance. Due to differences in methodologies, FG and CG models are rarely compared directly within evaluations in the literature, resulting in a lack of empirical data quantifying the retrieval performance-efficiency tradeoffs between the two. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the \texttt{FiCo-ITR} library, which standardises evaluation methodologies for both FG and CG models, facilitating direct comparisons. We conduct empirical evaluations of representative models from both subfields, analysing precision, recall, and computational complexity across varying data scales. Our findings offer new insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs between recent representative FG and CG models, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. These findings provide the foundation necessary to make more informed decisions regarding model selection for specific retrieval tasks and highlight avenues for future research into hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both FG and CG approaches.</description>

      <title>EXIT: An EXplicit Interest Transfer Framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation has attracted substantial interest in industrial apps such as Meituan, which serves multiple business domains via knowledge transfer and meets the diverse interests of users. However, existing methods typically follow an implicit modeling paradigm that blends the knowledge from both the source and target domains, and design intricate network structures to share learned embeddings or patterns between domains to improve recommendation accuracy. Since the transfer of interest signals is unsupervised, these implicit paradigms often struggle with the negative transfer resulting from differences in service functions and presentation forms across different domains. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective EXplicit Interest Transfer framework named EXIT to address the stated challenge. Specifically, we propose a novel label combination approach that enables the model to directly learn beneficial source domain interests through supervised learning, while excluding inappropriate interest signals. Moreover, we introduce a scene selector network to model the interest transfer intensity under fine-grained scenes. Offline experiments conducted on the industrial production dataset and online A/B tests validate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed framework. Without complex network structures or training processes, EXIT can be easily deployed in the industrial recommendation system. EXIT has been successfully deployed in the online homepage recommendation system of Meituan App, serving the main traffic.</description>

      <title>Aligning Query Representation with Rewritten Query and Relevance Judgments in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational search supports multi-turn user-system interactions to solve complex information needs. Different from the traditional single-turn ad-hoc search, conversational search encounters a more challenging problem of context-dependent query understanding with the lengthy and long-tail conversational history context. While conversational query rewriting methods leverage explicit rewritten queries to train a rewriting model to transform the context-dependent query into a stand-stone search query, this is usually done without considering the quality of search results. Conversational dense retrieval methods use fine-tuning to improve a pre-trained ad-hoc query encoder, but they are limited by the conversational search data available for training. In this paper, we leverage both rewritten queries and relevance judgments in the conversational search data to train a better query representation model. The key idea is to align the query representation with those of rewritten queries and relevant documents. The proposed model -- Query Representation Alignment Conversational Dense Retriever, QRACDR, is tested on eight datasets, including various settings in conversational search and ad-hoc search. The results demonstrate the strong performance of QRACDR compared with state-of-the-art methods, and confirm the effectiveness of representation alignment.</description>

Abstract: Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV stores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying hardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially running a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is accompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we introduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in heterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from its associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining their interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the downstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also ensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each other in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the caching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval. We deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its rapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.</description>

      <title>Sponsored is the New Organic: Implications of Sponsored Results on Quality of Search Results in the Amazon Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interleaving sponsored results (advertisements) amongst organic results on search engine result pages (SERP) has become a common practice across multiple digital platforms. Advertisements have catered to consumer satisfaction and fostered competition in digital public spaces; making them an appealing gateway for businesses to reach their consumers. However, especially in the context of digital marketplaces, due to the competitive nature of the sponsored results with the organic ones, multiple unwanted repercussions have surfaced affecting different stakeholders. From the consumers' perspective the sponsored ads/results may cause degradation of search quality and nudge consumers to potentially irrelevant and costlier products. The sponsored ads may also affect the level playing field of the competition in the marketplaces among sellers. To understand and unravel these potential concerns, we analyse the Amazon digital marketplace in four different countries by simulating 4,800 search operations. Our analyses over SERPs consisting 2M organic and 638K sponsored results show items with poor organic ranks (beyond 100th position) appear as sponsored results even before the top organic results on the first page of Amazon SERP. Moreover, we also observe that in majority of the cases, these top sponsored results are costlier and are of poorer quality than the top organic results. We believe these observations can motivate researchers for further deliberation to bring in more transparency and guard rails in the advertising practices followed in digital marketplaces.</description>

      <title>mGTE: Generalized Long-Context Text Representation and Reranking Models for Multilingual Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present systematic efforts in building long-context multilingual text representation model (TRM) and reranker from scratch for text retrieval. We first introduce a text encoder (base size) enhanced with RoPE and unpadding, pre-trained in a native 8192-token context (longer than 512 of previous multilingual encoders). Then we construct a hybrid TRM and a cross-encoder reranker by contrastive learning. Evaluations show that our text encoder outperforms the same-sized previous state-of-the-art XLM-R. Meanwhile, our TRM and reranker match the performance of large-sized state-of-the-art BGE-M3 models and achieve better results on long-context retrieval benchmarks. Further analysis demonstrate that our proposed models exhibit higher efficiency during both training and inference. We believe their efficiency and effectiveness could benefit various researches and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Image-text matching for large-scale book collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting and mapping all books in a collection of images to entries in a given book catalogue. Instead of performing independent retrieval for each book detected, we treat the image-text mapping problem as a many-to-many matching process, looking for the best overall match between the two sets. We combine a state-of-the-art segmentation method (SAM) to detect book spines and extract book information using a commercial OCR. We then propose a two-stage approach for text-image matching, where CLIP embeddings are used first for fast matching, followed by a second slower stage to refine the matching, employing either the Hungarian Algorithm or a BERT-based model trained to cope with noisy OCR input and partial text matches. To evaluate our approach, we publish a new dataset of annotated bookshelf images that covers the whole book collection of a public library in Spain. In addition, we provide two target lists of book metadata, a closed-set of 15k book titles that corresponds to the known library inventory, and an open-set of 2.3M book titles to simulate an open-world scenario. We report results on two settings, on one hand on a matching-only task, where the book segments and OCR is given and the objective is to perform many-to-many matching against the target lists, and a combined detection and matching task, where books must be first detected and recognised before they are matched to the target list entries. We show that both the Hungarian Matching and the proposed BERT-based model outperform a fuzzy string matching baseline, and we highlight inherent limitations of the matching algorithms as the target increases in size, and when either of the two sets (detected books or target book list) is incomplete. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/llabres/library-dataset</description>

      <title>Analyzing and reducing the synthetic-to-real transfer gap in Music Information Retrieval: the task of automatic drum transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic drum transcription is a critical tool in Music Information Retrieval for extracting and analyzing the rhythm of a music track, but it is limited by the size of the datasets available for training. A popular method used to increase the amount of data is by generating them synthetically from music scores rendered with virtual instruments. This method can produce a virtually infinite quantity of tracks, but empirical evidence shows that models trained on previously created synthetic datasets do not transfer well to real tracks. In this work, besides increasing the amount of data, we identify and evaluate three more strategies that practitioners can use to improve the realism of the generated data and, thus, narrow the synthetic-to-real transfer gap. To explore their efficacy, we used them to build a new synthetic dataset and then we measured how the performance of a model scales and, specifically, at what value it will stagnate when increasing the number of training tracks for different datasets. By doing this, we were able to prove that the aforementioned strategies contribute to make our dataset the one with the most realistic data distribution and the lowest synthetic-to-real transfer gap among the synthetic datasets we evaluated. We conclude by highlighting the limits of training with infinite data in drum transcription and we show how they can be overcome.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Analysis of Lithuanian Online Reviews Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a widely researched area within Natural Language Processing (NLP), attracting significant interest due to the advent of automated solutions. Despite this, the task remains challenging because of the inherent complexity of languages and the subjective nature of sentiments. It is even more challenging for less-studied and less-resourced languages such as Lithuanian. Our review of existing Lithuanian NLP research reveals that traditional machine learning methods and classification algorithms have limited effectiveness for the task. In this work, we address sentiment analysis of Lithuanian five-star-based online reviews from multiple domains that we collect and clean. We apply transformer models to this task for the first time, exploring the capabilities of pre-trained multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on fine-tuning BERT and T5 models. Given the inherent difficulty of the task, the fine-tuned models perform quite well, especially when the sentiments themselves are less ambiguous: 80.74% and 89.61% testing recognition accuracy of the most popular one- and five-star reviews respectively. They significantly outperform current commercial state-of-the-art general-purpose LLM GPT-4. We openly share our fine-tuned LLMs online.</description>

      <title>Practical and Robust Safety Guarantees for Advanced Counterfactual Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR ) can be risky; various circumstances can cause it to produce sub-optimal models that hurt performance when deployed. Safe CLTR was introduced to mitigate these risks when using inverse propensity scoring to correct for position bias. However, the existing safety measure for CLTR is not applicable to state-of-the-art CLTR, it cannot handle trust bias, and its guarantees rely on specific assumptions about user behavior. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we generalize the existing safe CLTR approach to make it applicable to state-of-the-art doubly robust (DR) CLTR and trust bias. Second, we propose a novel approach, proximal ranking policy optimization (PRPO ), that provides safety in deployment without assumptions about user behavior. PRPO removes incentives for learning ranking behavior that is too dissimilar to a safe ranking model. Thereby, PRPO imposes a limit on how much learned models can degrade performance metrics, without relying on any specific user assumptions. Our experiments show that both our novel safe doubly robust method and PRPO provide higher performance than the existing safe inverse propensity scoring approach. However, when circumstances are unexpected, the safe doubly robust approach can become unsafe and bring detrimental performance. In contrast, PRPO always maintains safety, even in maximally adversarial situations. By avoiding assumptions, PRPO is the first method with unconditional safety in deployment that translates to robust safety for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>QAEA-DR: A Unified Text Augmentation Framework for Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dense retrieval, embedding long texts into dense vectors can result in information loss, leading to inaccurate query-text matching. Additionally, low-quality texts with excessive noise or sparse key information are unlikely to align well with relevant queries. Recent studies mainly focus on improving the sentence embedding model or retrieval process. In this work, we introduce a novel text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. This framework transforms raw documents into information-dense text formats, which supplement the original texts to effectively address the aforementioned issues without modifying embedding or retrieval methodologies. Two text representations are generated via large language models (LLMs) zero-shot prompting: question-answer pairs and element-driven events. We term this approach QAEA-DR: unifying question-answer generation and event extraction in a text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. To further enhance the quality of generated texts, a scoring-based evaluation and regeneration mechanism is introduced in LLM prompting. Our QAEA-DR model has a positive impact on dense retrieval, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.</description>

      <title>POSIT: Promotion of Semantic Item Tail via Adversarial Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many recommendations, a handful of popular items (e.g., movies / television shows, news, etc.) can be dominant in recommendations for many users. However, we know that in a large catalog of items, users are likely interested in more than what is popular. The dominance of popular items may mean that users will not see items that they would probably enjoy. In this paper, we propose a technique to overcome this problem using adversarial machine learning. We define a metric to translate the user-level utility metric in terms of an advantage/disadvantage over items. We subsequently used that metric in an adversarial learning framework to systematically promote disadvantaged items. Distinctly, our method integrates a small-capacity model to produce semantically meaningful weights, leading to an algorithm that identifies and promotes a semantically similar item within the learning process. In the empirical study, we evaluated the proposed technique on three publicly available datasets and seven competitive baselines. The result shows that our proposed method not only improves the coverage, but also, surprisingly, improves the overall performance.</description>

      <title>CODE-ACCORD: A Corpus of Building Regulatory Data for Rule Generation towards Automatic Compliance Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Compliance Checking (ACC) within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector necessitates automating the interpretation of building regulations to achieve its full potential. Converting textual rules into machine-readable formats is challenging due to the complexities of natural language and the scarcity of resources for advanced Machine Learning (ML). Addressing these challenges, we introduce CODE-ACCORD, a dataset of 862 sentences from the building regulations of England and Finland. Only the self-contained sentences, which express complete rules without needing additional context, were considered as they are essential for ACC. Each sentence was manually annotated with entities and relations by a team of 12 annotators to facilitate machine-readable rule generation, followed by careful curation to ensure accuracy. The final dataset comprises 4,297 entities and 4,329 relations across various categories, serving as a robust ground truth. CODE-ACCORD supports a range of ML and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including text classification, entity recognition, and relation extraction. It enables applying recent trends, such as deep neural networks and large language models, to ACC.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Content-based Recommendation via Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world applications, users express different behaviors when they interact with different items, including implicit click/like interactions, and explicit comments/reviews interactions. Nevertheless, almost all recommender works are focused on how to describe user preferences by the implicit click/like interactions, to find the synergy of people. For the content-based explicit comments/reviews interactions, some works attempt to utilize them to mine the semantic knowledge to enhance recommender models. However, they still neglect the following two points: (1) The content semantic is a universal world knowledge; how do we extract the multi-aspect semantic information to empower different domains? (2) The user/item ID feature is a fundamental element for recommender models; how do we align the ID and content semantic feature space? In this paper, we propose a `plugin' semantic knowledge transferring method \textbf{LoID}, which includes two major components: (1) LoRA-based large language model pretraining to extract multi-aspect semantic information; (2) ID-based contrastive objective to align their feature spaces. We conduct extensive experiments with SOTA baselines on real-world datasets, the detailed results demonstrating significant improvements of our method LoID.</description>

      <title>DCNv3: Towards Next Generation Deep Cross Network for CTR Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep &amp; Cross Network and its derivative models have become an important paradigm in click-through rate (CTR) prediction due to their effective balance between computational cost and performance. However, these models face four major limitations: (1) while most models claim to capture high-order feature interactions, they often do so implicitly and non-interpretably through deep neural networks (DNN), which limits the trustworthiness of the model's predictions; (2) the performance of existing explicit feature interaction methods is often weaker than that of implicit DNN, undermining their necessity; (3) many models fail to adaptively filter noise while enhancing the order of feature interactions; (4) the fusion methods of most models cannot provide suitable supervision signals for their different interaction methods.
  To address the identified limitations, this paper proposes the next generation Deep Cross Network (DCNv3) and Shallow &amp; Deep Cross Network (SDCNv3). These models ensure interpretability in feature interaction modeling while exponentially increasing the order of feature interactions to achieve genuine Deep Crossing rather than just Deep &amp; Cross. Additionally, we employ a Self-Mask operation to filter noise and reduce the number of parameters in the cross network by half. In the fusion layer, we use a simple yet effective loss weight calculation method called Tri-BCE to provide appropriate supervision signals. Comprehensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of DCNv3 and SDCNv3. The code, running logs, and detailed hyperparameter configurations are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCNv3-E352.</description>

      <title>Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL)-based recommender systems have gained prominence in the context of Heterogeneous Graph (HG) due to their capacity to enhance the consistency of representations across different views. However, existing frameworks often neglect the fact that user-item interactions within HG are governed by diverse latent intents (e.g., brand preferences or demographic characteristics of item audiences), which are pivotal in capturing fine-grained relations. The exploration of these underlying intents, particularly through the lens of meta-paths in HGs, presents us with two principal challenges: i) How to integrate CL with intents; ii) How to mitigate noise from meta-path-driven intents.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework termed Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (IHGCL), which designed to enhance CL-based recommendation by capturing the intents contained within meta-paths. Specifically, the IHGCL framework includes: i) a meta-path-based Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) approach to effectively integrate intents into the recommendation, constructing intent-intent contrast and intent-interaction contrast; ii) a Bottlenecked AutoEncoder (BAE) that combines mask propagation with the information bottleneck principle to significantly reduce noise perturbations introduced by meta-paths. Empirical evaluations conducted across six distinct datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our IHGCL framework relative to conventional baseline methods. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IHGCL.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Audio Recommendations for the Long-Term: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel podcast recommender system deployed at industrial scale. This system successfully optimizes personal listening journeys that unfold over months for hundreds of millions of listeners. In deviating from the pervasive industry practice of optimizing machine learning algorithms for short-term proxy metrics, the system substantially improves long-term performance in A/B tests. The paper offers insights into how our methods cope with attribution, coordination, and measurement challenges that usually hinder such long-term optimization. To contextualize these practical insights within a broader academic framework, we turn to reinforcement learning (RL). Using the language of RL, we formulate a comprehensive model of users' recurring relationships with a recommender system. Then, within this model, we identify our approach as a policy improvement update to a component of the existing recommender system, enhanced by tailored modeling of value functions and user-state representations. Illustrative offline experiments suggest this specialized modeling reduces data requirements by as much as a factor of 120,000 compared to black-box approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11527v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models can perform well on general natural language tasks, but their effectiveness is still suboptimal for information extraction (IE). Recent works indicate that the main reason lies in the lack of extensive data on IE instructions. Note that the existing datasets on IE instructions not only have limited coverage but also involve high construction costs. To address this issue, we introduce InstructIE, a bilingual instruction-based IE dataset, which covers 12 diverse domains. We propose KG2Instruction, a framework specifically for the automatic generation of such datasets. Additionally, we manually annotate the test set. Experimental results demonstrate that large language models trained with InstructIE can not only obtain better IE capabilities but also enhance zero-shot performance compared with baselines.</description>

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (w.r.t. Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</description>

      <title>RAM-EHR: Retrieval Augmentation Meets Clinical Predictions on Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RAM-EHR, a Retrieval AugMentation pipeline to improve clinical predictions on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). RAM-EHR first collects multiple knowledge sources, converts them into text format, and uses dense retrieval to obtain information related to medical concepts. This strategy addresses the difficulties associated with complex names for the concepts. RAM-EHR then augments the local EHR predictive model co-trained with consistency regularization to capture complementary information from patient visits and summarized knowledge. Experiments on two EHR datasets show the efficacy of RAM-EHR over previous knowledge-enhanced baselines (3.4% gain in AUROC and 7.2% gain in AUPR), emphasizing the effectiveness of the summarized knowledge from RAM-EHR for clinical prediction tasks. The code will be published at \url{https://github.com/ritaranx/RAM-EHR}.</description>

      <title>Ink and Individuality: Crafting a Personalised Narrative in the Age of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints, in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing writing assistants for personalization and individuality.</description>

      <title>BERT-Enhanced Retrieval Tool for Homework Plagiarism Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text plagiarism detection task is a common natural language processing task that aims to detect whether a given text contains plagiarism or copying from other texts. In existing research, detection of high level plagiarism is still a challenge due to the lack of high quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a plagiarized text data generation method based on GPT-3.5, which produces 32,927 pairs of text plagiarism detection datasets covering a wide range of plagiarism methods, bridging the gap in this part of research. Meanwhile, we propose a plagiarism identification method based on Faiss with BERT with high efficiency and high accuracy. Our experiments show that the performance of this model outperforms other models in several metrics, including 98.86\%, 98.90%, 98.86%, and 0.9888 for Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, respectively. At the end, we also provide a user-friendly demo platform that allows users to upload a text library and intuitively participate in the plagiarism analysis.</description>

      <title>Towards Completeness-Oriented Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, integrating external tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant attention as an effective strategy to mitigate the limitations inherent in their pre-training data. However, real-world systems often incorporate a wide array of tools, making it impractical to input all tools into LLMs due to length limitations and latency constraints. Therefore, to fully exploit the potential of tool-augmented LLMs, it is crucial to develop an effective tool retrieval system. Existing tool retrieval methods primarily focus on semantic matching between user queries and tool descriptions, frequently leading to the retrieval of redundant, similar tools. Consequently, these methods fail to provide a complete set of diverse tools necessary for addressing the multifaceted problems encountered by LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel modelagnostic COllaborative Learning-based Tool Retrieval approach, COLT, which captures not only the semantic similarities between user queries and tool descriptions but also takes into account the collaborative information of tools. Specifically, we first fine-tune the PLM-based retrieval models to capture the semantic relationships between queries and tools in the semantic learning stage. Subsequently, we construct three bipartite graphs among queries, scenes, and tools and introduce a dual-view graph collaborative learning framework to capture the intricate collaborative relationships among tools during the collaborative learning stage. Extensive experiments on both the open benchmark and the newly introduced ToolLens dataset show that COLT achieves superior performance. Notably, the performance of BERT-mini (11M) with our proposed model framework outperforms BERT-large (340M), which has 30 times more parameters. Furthermore, we will release ToolLens publicly to facilitate future research on tool retrieval.</description>

      <title>Do We Really Need Graph Convolution During Training? Light Post-Training Graph-ODE for Efficient Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency and scalability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in training recommender systems (RecSys) have been persistent concerns, hindering their deployment in real-world applications. This paper presents a critical examination of the necessity of graph convolutions during the training phase and introduces an innovative alternative: the Light Post-Training Graph Ordinary-Differential-Equation (LightGODE). Our investigation reveals that the benefits of GCNs are more pronounced during testing rather than training. Motivated by this, LightGODE utilizes a novel post-training graph convolution method that bypasses the computation-intensive message passing of GCNs and employs a non-parametric continuous graph ordinary-differential-equation (ODE) to dynamically model node representations. This approach drastically reduces training time while achieving fine-grained post-training graph convolution to avoid the distortion of the original training embedding space, termed the embedding discrepancy issue. We validate our model across several real-world datasets of different scales, demonstrating that LightGODE not only outperforms GCN-based models in terms of efficiency and effectiveness but also significantly mitigates the embedding discrepancy commonly associated with deeper graph convolution layers. Our LightGODE challenges the prevailing paradigms in RecSys training and suggests re-evaluating the role of graph convolutions, potentially guiding future developments of efficient large-scale graph-based RecSys.</description>
