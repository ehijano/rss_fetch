      <title>Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07148v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Computing Certificates of Strictly Positive Polynomials in Archimedean Quadratic Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New results on computing certificates of strictly positive polynomials in Archimedean quadratic modules are presented. The results build upon (i) Averkov's method for generating a strictly positive polynomial for which a membership certificate can be more easily computed than the input polynomial whose certificate is being sought, and (ii) Lasserre's method for generating a certificate by successively approximating a nonnegative polynomial by sums of squares. First, a fully constructive method based on Averkov's result is given by providing details about the parameters; further, his result is extended to work on arbitrary subsets, in particular, the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, producing globally strictly positive polynomials. Second, Lasserre's method is integrated with the extended Averkov construction to generate certificates. Third, the methods have been implemented and their effectiveness is illustrated. Examples are given on which the existing software package RealCertify appears to struggle, whereas the proposed method succeeds in generating certificates. Several situations are identified where an Archimedean polynomial does not have to be explicitly included in a set of generators of an Archimedean quadratic module. Unlike other approaches for addressing the problem of computing certificates, the methods/approach presented is easier to understand as well as implement.</description>

      <title>On the Computation of Newton Polytopes of Eliminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For systems of polynomial equations, we study the problem of computing the Newton polytope of their eliminants. As was shown by Esterov and Khovanskii, such Newton polytopes are mixed fiber polytopes of the Newton polytopes of the input equations. We use their results in combination with mixed subdivisions to design an algorithm computing these special polytopes. We demonstrate the increase in practical performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods using tropical geometry and discuss the differences that lead to this increase in performance. We also demonstrate an application of our work to differential elimination.</description>
