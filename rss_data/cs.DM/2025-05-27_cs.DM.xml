      <title>Density Decomposition in Dual-Modular Optimization: Markets, Fairness, and Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a unified framework for optimization problems defined on dual-modular instances, where the input comprises a finite ground set $V$ and two set functions: a monotone supermodular reward function $\f$ and a strictly monotone submodular cost function $\g$. This abstraction captures and generalizes classical models in economics and combinatorial optimization, including submodular utility allocation (SUA) markets and combinatorial contracts. At the core of our framework is the notion of density decomposition, which extends classical results to the dual-modular setting and uncovers structural insights into fairness and optimality.
  We show that the density decomposition yields a canonical vector of reward-to-cost ratios (densities) that simultaneously characterizes market equilibria, fair allocations -- via both lexicographic optimality and local maximin conditions -- and best-response strategies in contract design. Our main result proves the equivalence of these fairness notions and guarantees the existence of allocations that realize the decomposition densities.
  Our technical contributions include the analysis of a broad family of convex programs -- parameterized by divergences such as quadratic, logarithmic, and hockey-stick functions -- whose minimizers recover the density decomposition. We prove that any strictly convex divergence yields the same canonical density vector, and that locally maximin allocations act as universal minimizers for all divergences satisfying the data processing inequality.
  As an application of our framework, we determine the structure and number of critical values in the combinatorial contracts problem. Additionally, we generalize a Frank-Wolfe-type iterative method for approximating the dual-modular density decomposition, establishing both convergence guarantees and practical potential through efficient gradient oracle design.</description>

      <title>Bounding Width on Graph Classes of Constant Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine if the width of a graph class ${\cal G}$ changes from unbounded to bounded if we consider only those graphs from ${\cal G}$ whose diameter is bounded. As parameters we consider treedepth, pathwidth, treewidth and clique-width, and as graph classes we consider classes defined by forbidding some specific graph $F$ as a minor, induced subgraph or subgraph, respectively. Our main focus is on treedepth for $F$-subgraph-free graphs of diameter at most~$d$ for some fixed integer $d$. We give classifications of boundedness of treedepth for $d\in \{4,5,\ldots\}$ and partial classifications for $d=2$ and $d=3$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Randomness recycling'' is a powerful algorithmic technique for reusing a fraction of the random information consumed by a randomized algorithm to reduce its entropy requirements. This article presents a family of efficient randomness recycling algorithms for sampling a sequence $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots$ of discrete random variables whose joint distribution follows an arbitrary stochastic process. We develop randomness recycling strategies to reduce the entropy cost of a variety of prominent sampling algorithms, which include uniform sampling, inverse transform sampling, lookup table sampling, alias sampling, and discrete distribution generating (DDG) tree sampling. Our method achieves an expected amortized entropy cost of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k + \varepsilon$ input random bits per output sample using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space, which is arbitrarily close to the optimal Shannon entropy rate. The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improve upon the Han and Hoshi interval algorithm and Knuth and Yao entropy-optimal algorithm for sampling a discrete random sequence. An empirical evaluation of the algorithm shows that it achieves state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant random sampling library in the C programming language.</description>

      <title>Pathographs and some (un)decidability results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce pathographs as a framework to study graph classes defined by forbidden structures, including forbidding induced subgraphs, minors, etc. Pathographs approximately generalize s-graphs of L\'ev\^eque--Lin--Maffray--Trotignon by the addition of two extra adjacency relations: one between subdivisible edges and vertices called spokes, and one between pairs of subdivisible edges called rungs. We consider the following decision problem: given a pathograph $\mathfrak{H}$ and a finite set of pathographs $\mathcal{F}$, is there an $\mathcal{F}$-free realization of $\mathfrak{H}$? This may be regarded as a generalization of the "graph class containment problem": given two graph classes $S$ and $S'$, is it the case that $S\subseteq S'$? We prove the pathograph realization problem is undecidable in general, but it is decidable in the case that $\mathfrak{H}$ has no rungs (but may have spokes), or if $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under adding edges, spokes, and rungs. We also discuss some potential applications to proving decomposition theorems.</description>

      <title>Balanced assignments of periodic tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of assigning periodic tasks to workers in a balanced way, i.e., so that each worker performs every task with the same frequency over the long term. The input consists of a list of tasks to be repeated weekly at fixed times and a number of indistinguishable workers. In the basic version, the sole constraint is that no worker performs two tasks simultaneously. In the extended version, additional constraints can be introduced, such as limits on the total number of working hours per week.
  Regarding the basic version, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a balanced assignment is established. This condition can be verified in polynomial time. For the extended version, it is demonstrated that whenever a balanced assignment exists, a periodic balanced assignment exists as well, with a tighter bound on the period for the basic version.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Composition of Elementary State Machines, with an Application to the Reversal of Cellular Automata Rule 90</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of a one-dimensional lattice of state machines on two states and two symbols sequentially updated via a process of "reflexive composition." The space of 256 machines exhibits a variety of behavior, including substitution, reversible "billiard ball" dynamics, and fractal nesting. We show that one machine generates the Sierpinski Triangle and, for a subset of boundary conditions, is isomorphic to cellular automata Rule 90 in Wolfram's naming scheme. More surprisingly, two other machines follow trajectories that map to Rule 90 in reverse. Whereas previous techniques have been developed to uncover preimages of Rule 90, this is the first study to produce such inverse dynamics naturally from the formalism itself. We argue that the system's symmetric treatment of state and message underlies its expressive power.</description>

      <title>Coloring Grids Avoiding Bicolored Paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vertex-coloring problem on graphs avoiding bicolored members of a family of subgraphs has been widely studied. Most well-known examples are star coloring and acyclic coloring of graphs (Gr\"unbaum, 1973) where bicolored copies of $P_4$ and cycles are not allowed, respectively. In this paper, we study a variation of this problem, by considering vertex coloring on grids forbidding bicolored paths. We let $P_k$-chromatic number of a graph be the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertex set properly avoiding a bicolored $P_k.$ We show that in any 3-coloring of the cartesian product of paths, $P_{k-2}\square P_{k-2}$, there is a bicolored $P_k.$ With our result, the problem of finding the $P_k$-chromatic number of product of two paths (2-dimensional grid) is settled for all $k.$</description>

      <title>Algorithms and complexity for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set of a graph is a subset $M$ of its vertices such that for every edge $e$ in the graph, deleting $e$ increases the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $M$. We study the following computational problem \textsc{MEG-set}: given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ has a monitoring edge geodetic set of size at most $k$. We prove that the problem is NP-hard even for 2-apex 3-degenerate graphs, improving a result by Haslegrave (Discrete Applied Mathematics 2023). Additionally, we prove that the problem cannot be solved in subexponential-time, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even for 3-degenerate graphs. Further, we prove that the optimization version of the problem is APX-hard, even for 4-degenerate graphs. Complementing these hardness results, we prove that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for interval graphs, a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for general graphs with clique-width plus diameter as the parameter, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for chordal graphs with treewidth as the parameter. We also provide an approximation algorithm with factor $\ln m\cdot OPT$ and $\sqrt{n\ln m}$ for the optimization version of the problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ the number of vertices, and $OPT$ is the size of a minimum monitoring edge-geodetic set of the input graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chernyshev, Rauch, and Rautenbach proved that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{11}{5}n-\frac{18}{5}$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest, and conjectured that the same remains true if the graph has less than $3n-6$ edges. We improve their result by proving that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{9}{4}n$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest. We also study weaker versions of the problem that might lead to an improvement on the bound obtained.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>
