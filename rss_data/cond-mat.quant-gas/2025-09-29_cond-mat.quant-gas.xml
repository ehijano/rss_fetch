      <title>Exploring Magnetic Phases in Dual-Species Mott insulating Spinor Lattice Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Mott insulating phases of dual-species bosonic spinor lattice gases, emphasizing the intriguing interplay between synthetic flux and inter-species spin exchange interaction. One of the species is subjected to Raman assisted tunneling, which leads to a synthetic flux within the framework of synthetic dimensions. In the deep Mott regime, the low energy physics is governed by an unconventional and highly tunable spin model, which is characterized by two distinct spin chains. The synthetic flux serves as an effective spin-orbit coupling, inducing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in one of the spin chains. The inter-species spin exchange interaction gives rise to the inter-chain coupling embodied as an isotropic XX interaction. Using time-evolving block decimation method for tensor network states, we compute order parameters, correlation functions and structure factors to identify the ground state magnetic phases. The DM interaction in one species, when combined with the inter-species spin-exchange interaction, can induce spiral magnetic order in the second, otherwise non-chiral species. Besides, the interplay of a transverse field applied to one spin chain and the inter-species coupling can drive both spin chains into a paramagnetic phase simultaneously. These results reveal that inter-species coupling serves as a powerful conduit for transmitting magnetic correlations, enabling exotic phases beyond the single-component perspective.</description>

      <title>Tetratomic states of microwave dressed and associated ultracold 23Na40K molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold diatomic molecules have achieved significant breakthroughs in recent years, enabling the exploration of quantum chemistry, precision measurements, and strongly correlated many-body physics. Extending ultracold molecular complexity to polyatomic molecules, such as triatomic and tetratomic molecules, has attracted considerable interest. However, the realization of ultracold polyatomic molecules remains technically challenging due to their complex energy-level structures. While only a few experiments have successfully demonstrated the formation of polyatomic molecules by magnetoassociation or electroassociation, here we present the first step toward producing tetratomic molecules through the development of a microwave association technique combined with microwave dressing. When the two lowest rotational states of the molecules are dressed by a microwave field, weakly bound tetramer states emerge in the entrance channel with free dark excited states $\ket{0}$ and a dressed state $\ket{+}$. The spectroscopy of these weakly bound tetramers is probed by another microwave field that drives transitions from the populated dressed states $\ket{+}$. By precisely discriminating the complex hyperfine structure of the dark excited level $\ket{0}$ from the dressed-state spectroscopy, the binding energy of the tetratomic molecules is measured and characterized. Our work contributes to the understanding of complex few-body physics within a system of microwave-dressed molecules and may open an avenue toward the creation and control of ultracold polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Coupling induced emergent topology in a two-leg fermionic ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved two-dimensional spectroscopy as a probe of nonlinear quantum field dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent collective excitations constitute a hallmark of interacting quantum many-body systems, yet in solid-state platforms their study has been largely limited by the constraints of linear-response probes and by finite momentum resolution. We propose to overcome these limitations by combining the spatial resolution of ultracold atomic systems with the nonlinear probing capabilities of two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS). As a concrete illustration, we analyze momentum-resolved 2DS of the quantum sine-Gordon model describing the low energy dynamics of two weakly coupled one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. This approach reveals distinctive many-body signatures, most notably asymmetric cross-peaks reflecting the interplay between isolated ($B_2$ breather) and continuum ($B_1$ pair) modes. The protocol further enables direct characterization of anharmonicity and disorder, establishing momentum-resolved 2DS as both a powerful diagnostic for quantum simulators and a versatile probe of correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Universality of Shallow Global Quenches in Critical Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in the Spatial Evolution of a Single Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) reveals that frequent measurements can suppress quantum evolution, but the detailed dynamics of the system under finite-duration measurements in experiments remain insufficiently explored. Here, we employ an optical dipole trap as a projective measurement to study the motion of a single cold atom in free space. By monitoring atomic loss, we directly observe the QZE in single-atom motion in free space and find that the effect of dipole measurements on the atom comprises a short-time collapse followed by subsequent periodic unitary evolution, thereby providing an intuitive physical picture of measurement backaction across different timescales. We further investigate the effects of measurement frequency, strength, and spatial position, demonstrating that measurements not only suppress the spreading of quantum states but also enable deterministic preparation of distinct motional states. Furthermore, by dynamically controlling the measurement position, we achieve measurement-induced directional transport of a single atom without imparting additional momentum. Our results provide a direct experimental demonstration of the QZE in real space and establish a versatile framework for measurement-based control of atomic motion, paving the way for motional-state engineering in cold-atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-destructive optical read-out and manipulation of circular Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the thriving quantum computation and quantum simulation platforms based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, those using circular Rydberg atoms are particularly promising. These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum ($\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform, combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\ell$ Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation induced by a F\"orster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing work-extraction in quantum batteries via correlated reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Going beyond isolated system dynamics, we examine how local and spatially correlated reservoirs influence the work extraction in quantum batteries. By employing a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and amplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can significantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the dephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount of extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell battery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing ergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases. Numerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system sizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the dynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting coherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum batteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted from quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and local reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains independent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits a clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting distinct operational behaviors under different noise models. In addition, we reveal that when the battery dynamics is governed by an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions, it yields higher ergotropy compared to short-range interactions, emphasizing the advantages of reservoir engineering for efficient device design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Evolution of density variations in a trapped atomic superfluid driven into turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the free decay of a turbulent trapped Bose gas by analyzing the temporal evolution of density variations extracted from absorption images. We introduce a parameter $\delta$ as a simple and experimentally accessible observable that captures the amplitude of density variations. After the driving is turned off, this parameter exhibits a clear decay, which enabled us to identify a characteristic relaxation time. Interestingly, this timescale remains nearly constant across the range of excitation amplitudes explored, while the magnitude of $\delta$ varies with the injected energy. Numerical simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal a qualitatively similar behavior, both showing a decay of density variations over time.</description>

Abstract: We describe an apparatus that efficiently produces $^{23}$Na Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a hybrid trap that combines a quadrupole magnetic field with a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Using a Bayesian optimization framework, we systematically optimize all BEC production parameters in modest sized batches of highly correlated parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier-based technique to optimize the duration of different evaporation stages constrained to have a fixed total duration; this enables the progressive creation of increasingly rapid experimental sequences that still generate high quality BECs. Taken together, our techniques constitute a general approach for refining and accelerating sequence-based experimental protocols.</description>

      <title>Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00517v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</description>

      <title>Superfluids in expanding backgrounds and attractor times</title>

Abstract: We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\" uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>

Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</description>
