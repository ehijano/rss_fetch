      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Task Assignment in Aerial MEC Network: A Resource Coalition Cooperation Approach with Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.</description>

      <title>Q-learning-based Opportunistic Communication for Real-time Mobile Air Quality Monitoring Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on real-time air quality monitoring systems that rely on devices installed on automobiles in this research. We investigate an opportunistic communication model in which devices can send the measured data directly to the air quality server through a 4G communication channel or via Wi-Fi to adjacent devices or the so-called Road Side Units deployed along the road. We aim to reduce 4G costs while assuring data latency, where the data latency is defined as the amount of time it takes for data to reach the server. We propose an offloading scheme that leverages Q-learning to accomplish the purpose. The experiment results show that our offloading method significantly cuts down around 40-50% of the 4G communication cost while keeping the latency of 99.5% packets smaller than the required threshold.</description>

      <title>Matter: IoT Interoperability for Smart Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The smart home is a major Internet of Things (IoT) application domain with tremendous market expectations. However, communication solutions for smart home devices have exhibited a lack of interoperability, especially, but not only, at the highest layers of the protocol stack. This issue challenges the success of the smart home concept. In order to overcome this problem, crucial industry organizations, including Google, Apple, Amazon and the Connectivity Standards Alliance (formerly, the ZigBee Alliance) have collaborated to produce Matter, a connectivity solution intended to become a universal standard for the smart home. This paper overviews, evaluates and discusses Matter, focusing on its design, features, performance, and potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Load Estimation Problem: Cell Switching in HAPS-Assisted Sustainable 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to introduce and address the problem of traffic load estimation in the cell switching concept within the evolving landscape of vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets). The problem is that the practice of cell switching faces a significant challenge due to the lack of accurate data on the traffic load of sleeping small base stations (SBSs). This problem makes the majority of the studies in the literature, particularly those employing load-dependent approaches, impractical due to their basic assumption of perfect knowledge of the traffic loads of sleeping SBSs for the next time slot. Rather than developing another advanced cell switching algorithm, this study investigates the impacts of estimation errors and explores possible solutions through established methodologies in a novel vHetNet environment that includes the integration of a high altitude platform (HAPS) as a super macro base station (SMBS) into the terrestrial network. In other words, this study adopts a more foundational perspective, focusing on eliminating a significant obstacle for the application of advanced cell switching algorithms. To this end, we explore the potential of three distinct spatial interpolation-based estimation schemes: random neighboring selection, distance-based selection, and clustering-based selection. Utilizing a real dataset for empirical validations, we evaluate the efficacy of our proposed traffic load estimation schemes. Our results demonstrate that the multi-level clustering (MLC) algorithm performs exceptionally well, with an insignificant difference (i.e., 0.8%) observed between its estimated and actual network power consumption, highlighting its potential to significantly improve energy efficiency in vHetNets.</description>

      <title>Addressing Privacy Concerns in Joint Communication and Sensing for 6G Networks: Challenges and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision for 6G extends beyond mere communication, incorporating sensing capabilities to facilitate a diverse array of novel applications and services. However, the advent of joint communication and sensing (JCAS) technology introduces concerns regarding the handling of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) pertaining to individuals and objects, along with external third-party data and disclosure. Consequently, JCAS-based applications are susceptible to privacy breaches, including location tracking, identity disclosure, profiling, and misuse of sensor data, raising significant implications under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as other applicable standards. This paper critically examines emergent JCAS architectures and underscores the necessity for network functions to enable privacy-specific features in the 6G systems. We propose an enhanced JCAS architecture with additional network functions and interfaces, facilitating the management of sensing policies, consent information, and transparency guidelines, alongside the integration of sensing-specific functions and storage for sensing processing sessions. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive threat analysis for all interfaces, employing security threat model STRIDE and privacy threat model LINDDUN. We also summarise the identified threats using standard Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). Finally, we suggest the security and privacy controls as the mitigating strategies to counter the identified threats stemming from the JCAS architecture.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Caching at Network Edge: Classification, Solutions, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caching content at the network edge is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the network edge. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal surface for external attackers to obtain private data from the edge cache by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting to achieve better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the network edge. In this article, we are among the first to fill in this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the network edge. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of Privacy-Preserving Edge Caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the network edge from the perspective of private data. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the network edge. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>STX-Vote: Improving Reliability with Bit Voting in Synchronous Transmission-based IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks must meet strict reliability, latency, and low energy consumption requirements. However, traditional low-power wireless protocols are ineffective in finding a sweet spot for balancing these performance metrics. Recently, network flooding protocols based on Synchronous Transmissions (STX) have been proposed for better performance in reliability-critical IIoT, where simultaneous transmissions are possible without packet collisions. STX-based protocols can offer a competitive edge over routing-based protocols, particularly in dependability. However, they notably suffer from the beating effect, a physical layer phenomenon that results in sinusoidal interference across a packet and, consequently, packet loss. Thus, we introduce STX-Vote, an error correction scheme that can handle errors caused by beating effects. Importantly, we utilize transmission redundancy already inherent within STX protocols so do not incur additional on-air overhead. Through simulation, we demonstrate STX-Vote can provide a 40% increase in reliability. We subsequently implement STX-Vote on nRF52840-DK devices and perform extensive experiments. The results confirm that STX-Vote improves reliability by 25-28% for BLE 5 PHYs and 8% for IEEE 802.15.4; thus, it can complement existing error correction schemes.</description>

      <title>MemorAI: Energy-Efficient Last-Level Cache Memory Optimization for Virtualized RANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The virtualization of Radio Access Networks (vRAN) is well on its way to become a reality, driven by its advantages such as flexibility and cost-effectiveness. However, virtualization comes at a high price - virtual Base Stations (vBSs) sharing the same computing platform incur a significant computing overhead due to in extremis consumption of shared cache memory resources. Consequently, vRAN suffers from increased energy consumption, which fuels the already high operational costs in 5G networks. This paper investigates cache memory allocation mechanisms' effectiveness in reducing total energy consumption. Using an experimental vRAN platform, we profile the energy consumption and CPU utilization of vBS as a function of the network state (e.g., traffic demand, modulation scheme). Then, we address the high dimensionality of the problem by decomposing it per vBS, which is possible thanks to the Last-Level Cache (LLC) isolation implemented in our system. Based on this, we train a vBS digital twin, which allows us to train offline a classifier, avoiding the performance degradation of the system during training. Our results show that our approach performs very closely to an offline optimal oracle, outperforming standard approaches used in today's deployments.</description>

      <title>Empowering IoT Applications with Flexible, Energy-Efficient Remote Management of Low-Power Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), reliable and energy-efficient provision of IoT applications has become critical. Equipping IoT systems with tools that enable a flexible, well-performing, and automated way of monitoring and managing IoT edge devices is an essential prerequisite. In current IoT systems, low-power edge appliances have been utilized in a way that can not be controlled and re-configured in a timely manner. Hence, conducting a trade-off solution between manageability, performance and design requirements are demanded. This paper introduces a novel approach for fine-grained monitoring and managing individual micro-services within low-power edge devices, which improves system reliability and energy efficiency. The proposed method enables operational flexibility for IoT edge devices by leveraging a modularization technique. Following a review of existing solutions for remote-managed IoT services, a detailed description of the suggested approach is presented. Also, to explore the essential design principles that must be considered in this approach, the suggested architecture is elaborated in detail. Finally, the advantages of the proposed solution to deal with disruptions are demonstrated in the proof of concept-based experiments.</description>

      <title>GRAND Massive Parallel Decoding Framework for Low Latency in Beyond 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a massive parallel decoding GRAND framework. The framework introduces two novelties: 1. A likelihood function for $M$-QAM demodulated signals that effectively reduces the symbol error pattern space from $\mathcal{O}(5^{N/\log_2 M})$ down to $\mathcal{O}(4^{N/\log_2 M})$; and 2. A massively parallel matrix-vector multiplication for matrices of size $K\times N$ ($K \leq N$) that performs the multiplication in just $\mathcal{O}(\log_2 N)$ steps. We then apply the proposed GRAND approach to codes and operational modulation techniques used in the current 5G NR standard. Our framework is applicable not just to short codewords but to the full range of codewords from 32 bits up to 1024 bits used in the control channels of 5G NR. We also present simulation results with parity-check matrices of Polar codes with rate $R=1/2$ obtained from the 5G NR universal reliability sequence.</description>

      <title>XRLoc: Accurate UWB Localization to Realize XR Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the location of ultra-wideband (UWB) tag-attached objects and people in the real world is vital to enabling a smooth cyber-physical transition. However, most UWB localization systems today require multiple anchors in the environment, which can be very cumbersome to set up. In this work, we develop XRLoc, providing an accuracy of a few centimeters in many real-world scenarios. This paper will delineate the key ideas which allow us to overcome the fundamental restrictions that plague a single anchor point from localization of a device to within an error of a few centimeters. We deploy a VR chess game using everyday objects as a demo and find that our system achieves $2.4$ cm median accuracy and $5.3$ cm $90^\mathrm{th}$ percentile accuracy in dynamic scenarios, performing at least $8\times$ better than state-of-art localization systems. Additionally, we implement a MAC protocol to furnish these locations for over $10$ tags at update rates of $100$ Hz, with a localization latency of $\sim 1$ ms.</description>

      <title>Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. We can recommend a subset of the contents to the users which encourages the users to request these contents. Recommendation can thus be used to increase cache hits. We formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend. We provide an upper bound on the regret of our algorithm. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>
